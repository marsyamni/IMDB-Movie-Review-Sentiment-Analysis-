i never played the fallout games or knew anything about them so i had no idea what to expect but i have to say that ive really enjoyed it so far this show hooked me from the first episode and held my attention to the last i binged the entire season in two days and was still hoping for more episodes when i was done it seems like some of the people who actually played the games didnt like it as much but as long as try not to compare it to the game and just enjoy it for what it isand thats an entertaining fantasyscifi series the series should be judged on its own and not compared to the game the world building and cast are the best things about the show and i cant wait for more i promise youll have a blast watching this and will want to binge it as fast as you can
this is how you make a video game to movietv show series this is how you pander to gamers while appealing to new audiences this is excellent st century entertainmenti wont waste time explaining the premise im sure youve gotten the gist by now from other reviews just know that it seems like gamer who are fans of the game series such as myself are quite happy with it and that people unfamiliar with the game series like my wife are also engrossed with this showso many references to the game makes it fun to watch as a longtime gamer fan everything from junk decor like magazine racks and plastic jackolantern buckets to power armor enemies factions food chems characters and weapons is familiarsure it may be a bit overproduced have some cheesy and weak cgi effects and contain a lot of the modern formula in its script and story aside from that its got everything anyone would want for a riveting scifi action drama comedy horror adventure seriously this show like the game series covers all the basesand oh my goodness mini fangush moment here but i was so excited to hear matt berrys voice i was totally not expecting it and it was an awesome cameo as one of the easily recognizable robots in the universe of fallout and lets just say his is not the only shocking and awesome cameo in the series fans of shows like archer might be pleasantly surprised in episode whats also so cool is that like the stories you run into in the game there are a lot of really interesting plots with crazy twists the vaults may seem more like a paradise than on the surface but when you dig deep sometimes the vaults are scarier than reality under the sunfallout has been around for two and half decades and its taken them this long to finally come out with a tvmovie adaptation you know what since they nailed it id say it was worth the wait
fallout is even better than i expected its up there as one of the best video game adaptations ever fallout takes pace a couple hundred years after a nuclear apocalypse and people have to live in underground bunkers to protect themselves there is a world going on above full of radiation thats created mutants and a lawless society full of evil people and violence all the people living in these underground communities are forced to come up and live ella purcell stars as lucy one of the people whos never been above ground before and wasnt prepared for the lawless society it has become one of the most underrated actors ever in walton goggins steals the show once again as a mutant bandit this series is just flat out awesome
fallout franchise had a few shifts in the lore and perception resulting in even the fans arguing about what fallout should bewhile the series are not as grittydepressive as fallout  and followed a bit closer to the bethesdas vision the level of actual dedication to the franchise will make it liked by everyonethe props are amazing the lore is very fitting the characters are matching the universe ingame brands and characters are exactly in place it is no master chief from aliexpress but a great adaptation which does not retell the story of any of the games directlythe storytelling will both properly introduce the universe to those who had never heard about it and please the fans it is rare but what is even more outstanding  even if fallout games wouldnt exist the show is highly entertainingnowadays we see more and more gamesourced shows and it is great fallout joins cyberpunk arcane and the last of us in the list
i was afraid this show will be weak or average but its simply awesomeeverything is very detailed every item is like from fallout as if someone who knows the game created a movie  its truly shocking that this is possible in the humor the story the mood the music  everything is therei was afraid that lucy will be strong woman like in other modern shows but she is very cool and likeable of course cooper is fantastic and maximus is also greatdear amazon dear jeff bezos  please cancel rings of power immediately and put all your money into the next seasons of fallout
"i am a massive fan of the game and have gone through new vegas more times than i should admit but the embodiment and spirit is alive and well through the eyes of lucy mclean ella purnell a vault dweller who hasnt had to experience real adversity in lifeif youve seen blast from the past  a lot of this will be familiar though not as dark it took the simple sweet naive character of brendan fraser and put him in real world los angeles same here except much darkerthe humor is dark as well what director jonathan nolan did so well is to incorporate a sense of futility in the lives similar to game playthe lighting and camera work are spot on to the game you can tell they really studied it a lot of places if youve played the game will seem very familiar but also its just different enough where you dont roll your eyes thinking its all fan service he integrates small things like cram and nuka cola with such ease its almost like the meme where leo dicaprio keeps pointing at the screen to get your attentionthe eye popping primary colors of the ss era is in full swing if you cant tell the difference between film and digital this puts your eyes to ease clearly this was a film shot movie glossy in texture they lean into the fringe edgesnot that any viewer would intellectually care but you really feel the wastelandagain if you played the game you know how many worlds they can explore here
actress ella purnell plays the wideeyed vault child perfectly shes sweet and wholesome in a newly brutal world similar to sandra bullocks portrayal of leona huxley in demolition man though not necessarily excited for a bygone erathe characters she encounters only beefs up the idea of how over her head shes gotten herself intothe setup does feel a little rush it begins with just absolute brutality yes this is introduced but it really plays like the game where violence is dismissed quickly if you havent played its going to be a little offputting but it does make sense it took me off guard for a moment the idea is to get that open world feel and this series does it perfectlythis is one of the video game series i am absolutely excited to see continue there is so much to mine and im ready for itwell done all"
i never write reviews but this was the best dang show series ive watched since band of brothers you dont need to know anything about the game like me to thoroughly enjoy it either the characters are interesting and none of them are unlikeable even the bad guys are likeable in a bad way acting is superb and the settingssfx are great the whole look of the show is a jetsons retrofuturistic lookthe actress who plays lucy plays the strong independent woman like it should be playedmaximus aka knight titus perhaps the most relatable to me at least if i found myself in a similar scenario as him but the most enjoyable to watch was walter googins as the cowboy ghoul his character arc probably isnt as complex as the other two main characters at least in the first season but he is quite satisfying how he takes cares of business  out of 
i was hoping this would be good last thing you wanna do is get the fallout fan base angry which after reading reviews on here and facebook you would think it was teally bad well its not they have an opportunity here not following a specific game and starting elsewhere was a great move the feel and the story is so far true to the lore the vault the wasteland the weapons suits all of it good dont listen to the fanboy experts even if this wasnt fallout based its still a good show looking forward to whats to come and so far its good i highly recommend it fallout fan or not
as someone who grew up in the era where the video game was popular all i can say is wow this is one of the best adaptations ive seen in a long time because it takes what was successful about the beloved video game and matches it with an original story and i definitely think all the praise about this show is well deserved plus the cast is really good too and if you are a fan of either the game or the show this is for you and i definitely cant wait for season two i also have a feeling that season two will be bigger better also expands the universe from the video game and i am definitely a fan of dystopian futures
knowing the history of videogame adaptations i really expected the worst from this adding that i could be quite the harsh critic loving the games as i dobut honestly this exceeded my expectations from funny gory to exciting and epic this had it all you feel like the perfect mixture of falloutexperts and newcomers came to sit at the table and make a good adaptation that everyone can enjoy even the game got a good reaclaimed boost from this which confirms the series succesevery character got its up and downs feeling quite threedimensional there is no real hero  even though the lucycharacter embarks on the traditionel heroes journey knowing that the dark crazy and twisted world of the fallout apocalpye doesnt allow to just be the nice guynevertheless i have to say that walton goggins and his depiction of the ghoul carried the show for me at many points i couldnt get enough of his character and loved every scene he was in i cant wait to see the next season
being a fan of the fps games i was optimistic about the show when i read the game creator was involved it doesnt disappoint in that regard it captures the spirit of fallout quite well in every aspect the visuals the props the music the humor and specially the violence it really feels like youre watching cutscenes of a new fallout game where it disappoints is on the actual story the characters are interesting but the general plot and the arc of each one are completely predictable what kept my interest were the creative show dont tell moments and the funny surprises that happened here and there rather than the resolution of the plot which i could predict from a mile away its not great but its a good show and im looking forward to season 
the series is reviewing well because of nostalgia from gamers that really love the game as its tough to separate the twothe show is shallow and hollow walton goggins is the best part of the show the writing is horrible vault dwellers are ultra naive and assume an awkward sense of superiority other than that the show is super contrived the main character gets her finger cut off but replaced with a dead finger that works as if nothing ever happened the main brotherhood lacky somehow never gets caught doing everything wrong but even when he has the chance to do something amazing he blows itaside from the first two episodes its a pretty boring show people just have really low expectations
so im only peripherally familiar with fallout as my husband and son played the game so i had no expectations going into the watching of this series i was so pleasantly surprised to find the character lucy is no mary sue and in my opinion is the best written female character in an action series ive seen in quite a while the series is easy to follow even for the uninitiated such as myself it looks great the casting is perfect it has an intriguing mystery at its core and the pilot grabbed my attention upon hitting the play button there seems to be much debate about the timeline etc from dedicated fans but i recommend it regardless i do not believe in toxic fandom so i respect dissenting opinions in this regard we as an audience have been fed subpar content for far too long and i believe this series is worthy of a watch amazon actually and surprisingly got it right with this series and praise is due for that check it out
extraordinary detail extraordinary story extraordinary conclusion one of the finest fantasypost apocalyptic content i have seen so farthe series just takes off and theres no stopping back to back explosions at your face and leaves your jaw dropped on the floor the design cgi and attention to details is just groundbreaking content these days is just so mediocre that you dont even want to chance  hours of your life into watching something like aquaman  or wonder woman or the recent movies that make you question whats up with cgi hollywood tired already but then this comes out and kingdom of planet of apes comes out restoring your belief in the capabilities of true hollywood detail
ive watched all eight episodes of fallout and i have been pleasantly surprised this show does a really good job of nailing the feel of the games with its mix of gore and wacky humourall three protaganists are interesting to watch but i particularly liked the ghoul who had a strong backstory and the vault dweller whos naivety made for quite a few laughsthe locations in the show were styled on the game and were true to the game although they were all smaller locations there were no wanderings in large destroyed cities i guess that would have meant a bigger cgi budget so its understandablealso it would have been nice if there was more danger in the wasteland created by the multitude of creatures from the game this felt a bit neglected in the show again i suspect this would have added to the budget perhaps these small quibbles could be rectified in season  surely there will be a season  as this first season is surely going to be a successi absolutely loved the way the plot threads came together in the last episode it was really satisfying and leaves room for the story to continueone last point ive played and been a fan of all the games over the past few decades and find the star reviews from fans of the game to be very strange what are your expectations you have to give the writers the chance to tell a story about characters in the fallout world and theyve done that very well the set designers costume artists etc have nailed the style too so how can this be a star show insanity
fallout is a sure fire way to introduce nonfans to the iconic franchise as for me i had casual knowledge of the video games from friends and family but ive never played them myself ive gravitated to stuff like final fantasy mass effect and legend of zelda when it comes to roleplaying actionadventure games now i think i just might play them because the show does a good job of establishing the world for fans and nonfans alike this is video game television done right just like the last of us of which i am a fanthe show has your typical postapocalyptic tropes of desperate survivors killing each other for resources like food and water but things are distinctly more nuclear here as the worlds suffered several atomic holocausts since the latest century in fallouts timeline its a dark setting filled with surprisingly goofy black humor and bloody gunslinging action and a retrofuturistic future thats actually all about the future itself also the characters range from doeeyed people naive of the wider world to weary cowboys untrusting of anyone or anything unless they themselves are the ones in control of their own life also the brotherhood is like if a syndicate of steampunklike iron man suits brought medieval traditions into a postsocietal world of knights and squires doing the bidding of their lordsupdate relating to the series saying nothing of the spoilers here fallout season two is official will it continue the stories told here strictly or will there be even more characters set to appear in this series adapting one of gamings most iconic franchises whatever happens im sure itll continue what made season one a strong magnet for television audiences in the first place amazon may be letting the irony of the vault tec go under their nose or over their head but i dont know if anyone else is as oblivious to it as them its genuinely funny when a hit show has something to say about corporate america when the satire is backed by one of todays ultimate perps of corporate culture being a terrifyingly unstable doubleedged sword its funnily scary that wayfallout continues amazons tradition of trying to oust its competition in netflix and hbo by trying to use the methods of both brands releasing the show day one and using marquee actors like kyle maclachlan sex and violence to forward the story and ramin djawadi doing the theme music thats a must for hbo at this stage with the show continuing its gonna be interesting to see how the fallout show will go beyond the world of the gamesoverall its a good show its very watchable has a great postapocalyptic vibe to it and the story keeps getting more interesting the further you keep watching and seeing the world kind of open up as the episodes play alongfallout gets  imdb points  stars
this show does an absolutely great job respecting the lore and giving the show the care it deserves the writers were obviously educated on the franchise and did a lot of things rightcharacters were all around great when i saw the trailers and saw lucy trying to deliberate with the ghoul i was thinking it would be really childish and lacking of any tension but it shows her naivety and innocence in the show and shows how shes so out of her element its greatthe only hiccup is theres a little too much going on theres like  different stories that actually do converge quite nicely at the end but its a little disorienting throughout the entirety of the show its definitely better to have too much than too little but i couldve done with just a little less in my opinionregardless characters were great knowledge of the lore was great great plot great set up for season  funny references to the games throughout the show just a really good job all around even if youre not aware of the games or their story this works as a stand alone show just fine this is everything that shows should use as a template when making content that is from existing media very well done
i really thought after watching this show i was going to come back to imdb and see a score around  or  it looks like that is not the case and by leaving a  star review i am going to be in the minorityheres why i gave it that score it has appeal to the masses but does little to actually stand out as a piece of cinema it does capture the many fun details i wanted to see as someone who grew up playing fallout games but it fails to break away from the recycled hollywood template of making a modern day television show the acting is subpar most of it is badwalton goggins and moises arias are fantastic ella purnell can carry her weight but didnt particularly stand out the guy who plays maximus has a lot of work to do as an actor dogmeat did a great joboverall this movie felt like another safeway brand version of a show that could have been incredibly unique and badass some of the scenes were so cringe and hard to watch ie the bhos chanting maximus name at the end of the show like i said if you like taylor swift then you probably liked this show and thought it was badass if you dont like taylor swift and are a cinema connoisseur then this was enjoyable but at times hard to watch because of the extreme corninessit was great to finally watch a respectable adaptation of a game that i spent hundreds of hours playing in my youth and still cherish todaya for the adaptation but a c for the execution
i was really surprised on how this show turned out to be i consider myself a casual gamer and i had given a try to the fallout games before but i got to be honest  i didnt become a fan after some hours no matter how good the story was the overall gameplay didnt do it for me nonetheless i am really glad that the fans also enjoyed the adaption because i have a feeling that this is a rare occasion where the tv format actually works better for the story than the originali have been saying this often one of the most hard things to do in the entertainment industry is to successfully adapt a video game into a movie or a tv show weve seen great developments in this realm recently and fallout is just one of those recent successes everything seems to work perfectly the portray of the characters all around the amazing environment and overall atmosphere created with a mix of astonishing practical effects real locations and of course some cgi the narrative and story telling that feeds us the pieces of the puzzle slowly as the series progresses leaving room for some future surprises in the seasons to comei was really glad when i saw jonathan nolan was involved one of my favorite writers highly experienced in the scifi genre everything was aligned to make this a great projectthe way the moral grey areas are explored in this brutal and harsh environment are really well played out and of course i cant go without mentioning how incredibly well the political side was introduced within the context of the story for me it actually does serve as a cautionary tale it leaves room for some reflection i was shocked that this fictional made up apocalyptical and sadistic world brought some elements that are real today and others that while not a reality somehow they felt like a daunting possibility we really need to prioritize dialogue these days otherwise selfextinction is no longer a distant possibility but more of an inevitabilityits an amazing show great dialogues great cinematography well written even the graphical violence seems to serve its purpose  although some of the gore scenes felt a bit unnecessary  mixed up with some dark humor that actually does work quite well its a must i am really looking forward to see how everything wraps up
i dont think the series is bad but i have the same problem with it as i did with fallout   yes its still fallout but somehow its not my fallout anymore too colorful too squeaky too childish the series unfortunately doesnt make me think about going back to new vegasmaybe my problem is that i didnt like fallout  and have been very critical of the whole franchise ever since and maybe im too old fallout  fallout  fallout tactics broterhood of steel fallout  and fallout new vegas are games that i remember fondly but fallout  and fallout  were disasters in my eyesthis series isnt a disaster but its rather mediocre for me
im old now this show made me realize im just flat out old i dont get what it is people like i didnt laugh i didnt like the cgi gore i didnt like the characters i hated them actually  but i guess the sets and costumes were cool in a weird seaquest way but i just felt so lost on everything else for me its a mismatch between humor and i guess action or horror i dont know what the show is going for after the first fight scene with the ghoul i actually turned it off because it was so so slow even in the middle of the fight scene theyd stop and have characters explain things whats up with that why not just have a damn action scene i eventually started back up to finish it out but i just cant stand these characters is it supposed to be funny i am pretty sure it is but what is funny im not sure vault girls naivety is that the joke is that what im laughing at her being a moron or is it the horror and death is that the joke or is it the actual jokes which were lame i blame myself i think im just old and this is not meant for me its boring but flashy slow but frenetic the action is awkward and has too many jokes or attempts at jokes interstiched into it with weird explanations about the plot stuck in actually im fine this show just is just lame the more i think on it the more i realize its the show not me save your time and find something coherent or actually funny if your a huge nerd that plays online games i bet youll love her and i bet youll love all the jokesthe  stars is mainly for the costumes and some of the sets the rest is worse than mediocre
like many other reviewers here i am a diehard fan of the fallout games my introduction to the game series began  years ago when i picked up a copy of fallout  and ive been hooked ever since never in all that time had i ever wished for a spinoff tv series to be made about it who asked for it not me but nevertheless here it is it exists whether we like it or not and no matter how many negative reviews people submit based on pride protest or principle it will not change that fact look no one is forcing anyone who strongly objects to this series to watch it not yet anyway but if its mere existence truly offends you just dont watch it what is there to gain by coming here to thumbs down positive reviews because you are so aggrieved anyone and everyone is free to ignore the show just like im choosing to ignore the sense of entitlement these petty reviewbombers have by giving this new series the glowing review it rightfully deserves based on the meritswith that business out of the way my review here is for anyone with a sincere interest in this series in deciding whether they should give it a chance and to that i say yes absolutely you should whether you are a fan of the games or not as i previously mentioned i never asked for this show and was prepared to hate it but i kept an open mind as i watched and did my best to be fair in my overall judgement and the truth is the show is actually pretty fantastic i was not prepared for it to be as good as it is this show definitely caters to fans of the franchise with its high attention to detail and faithfulness to source material i sympathize with those who would have preferred that hollywood not make the series in the first place but at the same time now having watched it the hate towards it is pretty unjustified if the only crime is that it existsto the angry fallout fans i ask you this imagine a tv series is being made about this game that you and i both love imagine that its completely out of your control and production is actually happening if a fallout series has to exist what exactly would you want it to look like would it not be similar to exactly what jonathan nolan and lisa joy have created i mean visually its pretty spot on theyve built an immersive world that feels very authentic it feels like fallout it looks like fallout and it sounds like fallout okay maybe you would have preferred the show was modeled after the interplay games and not bethesdas fallout  or maybe you would have preferred the show runners double and triple check the accuracy of the lore because you find any cannon inconsistency unforgiveableso lets address the elephant in the room yes there are some glaring lore issues but it doesnt bother me why because a tv series is a different medium for storytelling than a video game for the sake of argument lets assume this new series runs for  seasons with  onehour episodes each thats a total of  hours screen time thats just a fraction of what most people put into playing a single game ive put hundreds of hours into fallout  alone when playing a game you have the luxury of time to explore it and study it as much as you like thats the beauty of fallout games but television doesnt work that way its not interactive the entertainment comes from literally just sitting in front of a screen and watchinglistening to a story viewers are going to tune out fast if it becomes overly pedantic and boring sometimes it is necessary to truncate andor modify original source material so that it translates better on screen and can hold the viewers attentionfor me personally as a longtime fan what mattered most was that the series captured the spirit message and immersive atmosphere of the games no matter what it needed to look and feel like fallout and nolan and joy nailed it i dont know what more they could have done to make the series better than it is and im honestly relieved that the creative liberties taken were not so egregious as to disrespect the entire franchise and its fanbase on the contrary theyve done an excellent job here they could have reimagined fallout into some truly terrible fan fiction but they didnt it feels like a true extension of the fallout universe and thats all i had hoped for jonathan nolan made this series because he is also a fan and avid player of fallout games if anyone could pull it off it was him
unfortunately that injury has left me with chronic head pain everyday i cant play video games i never heard of this until it became a show ive binged watched it over and over it really is that much fun dont come looking for serious scifi although it does pull at your heart strings from time to time it is a very well made show definitely love and care went into bringing this to life ella purnell as lucy maclean walter goggins as cooper howardthe ghoul and aaron moten as maximus are the stand outs of the series im really looking forward to a second season theres so many more questions that need to be answered
from the start of to the finish i could not stop watching this series sinse i have hundreds of hours playing fallout  with the expansions i can honestly say this series is very similar and was awesome seeing a game to series that was so good i feel this series have plenty of potential as the game has plenty of content they can work with and i hope to see a lot more seasons to come they have only grazed of how much potential there is in the fallout world the acting was good i loved the jokes and the gore got me looking away in the one scene and that does not often happen to me in a show
fallout  season  reviewjonathan nolan and todd howard truly brought fallout to life prior to any trailers i saw set photos of the costumes props and sets it looked like they were pulled straight out of the game and with bethesdas close relationship with nolan i didnt doubt it would be faithful to the visuals at least but what i didnt expect was how well written it was going to bestarting with our main character lucy maclean ella purnell shes a vault dweller from vault  who is on a mission to rescue her father from the wasteland warlord moldaver sarita choudhury very much akin to the main questline of bethesdas first fallout game fallout  although there are far more dark secrets revealed about the history of vaulttec which i wont spoilmaximus aaron moten is our second point of view character he serves to give us insight into the brotherhood of steel they are insular knights in power armor who search for prewar artifact maximus is at the bottom of this totem pole only becoming a squire when his friend gets injured then he lets his knight die because he was blaming him for his injuries maximus then takes knight tituss power armor and steals his identity overall he probably had the most character development gaining courage and compassion from having to endure the wastelandfinally there is my favorite character the ghoul walton goggins the ghoul has been a wandering bounty hunter for over  hundred years placing his birth date before even the bombs fell originally he was movie star cooper howard a former soldier who spends his days galavanting in movies as a cowboy while his wife barb frances turner is a head scientist for the development of vaults however its murky as to what happened to his family after the bombs fell now hes an actual cowboy being a relic of a previous age on a desperate search to find his family
can somebody explain whats the scene about the professor in the dog training facility meticulously hiding the dog but suddenly ended up making a cold fusionlucy discovering the cult that worships moldova and showing a video of people being eaten by gulper yet continues to hide the research of itshowing lots of messed up plots like showing vaulters being mutated without a reason or explanation of why are they mutated ghoul baiting the gulper just to try to stab it with a spear and loses its serum and just leaving it without the dogother than that the costume and the scene in relation to the game is perfect love the realistic vault the weapons and costumesjust wish the storyline direction is better
for those that have never played the game the basic premise is that the protagonist starts in an underground fallout shelter called a vault and through various circumstances is forced to the surface in a struggle to survivethis show gets that part right but its via a poorly written story that has no coherent thought process behind it sure theres a general plot that is followed in each episode unfortunately the writers dont seem to want to actually tell a good story they just want to set up individual scenes that are loosely tied together and dont even get me started on the plethora of plot holes and inconsistencieson a positive note the show does a good enough job of capturing the look and feel of the fallout world however it does not seem to populate that world with all of the enemies and monsters that you would find in the game it gives you a few ghouls and radroaches here and there but the actual fallout world is teeming with these as well as an abundance of other nasties to be dealt withoverall i was very disappointed with this because as the title says i expected greatness and i got mediocrity
im on episode  currently i am very impressed with the show i normally would not write a review but after reading the typical dei  star reviews by people who it is obvious have not even watched the show i felt obliged to tell people that it is in fact a good show it does not preach any sort of political message the cast is excellent it is a blend of fallout western and some gory flick that i cant quite name im serious about the gore you are going to see some heads explode it is the best tv adaptation of a video game to date and i highly recommend that everyone give it a chance you will enjoy it
the first episode really did what was necessary to get people hooked episode two was slow moving and i nearly turned it off after the first twenty minutes it wasnt until the show down in filly that i decided it was worth finishing each episode after felt like the pace was all over the place lots of slow bits a few exciting parts pretty meh as ive never played the games i went in blind trying to figure out what was going onoverall i think the show was done well however i have issues with how openended it was i know that cliffhangers are meant to keep people intrigued but as a writer myself i just think there was far too much unanswered the whole season could have been longer and the cliffhangers could have been much tidieraside from the annoying characters like thadeous who has the most punchable face ive ever seen shout out to the actor for playing the role well or the random vault  filled with mutated people im not sure if playing the games would even answer any of my questions as the show went in its own directioni will be watching season  in hopes that things get explained because nothing is more annoying than a storyline that introduces a bunch of things just to pretend they never happened heres looking at you gotthe acting itself was really good i think everyone did a great job portraying the characters for what they were you know the acting is good when you have strong emotional feelings about the charactersoverall i get why some people are hyping it up and i get why some people are tearing it apart im pretty in the middle right now but visually the show was pleasing and i really love the actors in it for how great they did so i went with a  overall hoping season  knocks our socks off and goes for the 
the best thing about the show is how they incorporated some of the best music of all time though that was all art captured from a bygone era this shows writing is very mediocre and might best be viewed with the dialogue turned off entirely in doing so you would experience the pretty great looking set designs and art you could then imagine the rest and create your own interpretations of what the characters might be talking about which could also be far more enjoyable let me set it up for you like they always say look at the birdie then imagine that governments arent actually to blame for disasters stick people in human farm capsules for a couple hundred years and see which psychoses explode with the exception of the cowboy the characters are undeveloped most of the vault dwellers are not only naive but also stupid there are a few fun cameos which offset the scene where you imagine michael rappaport weaseled his way into a role where he plays the complete opposite of how his character would have behaved the main characters stilted and missed every attempt at development throughout her story and is basically a version of zooey deschanel in that whos jess show or whatever it was called from start to finish mugging for cuteness cred enjoy how she has no serious emotional reaction when she has to do something that should be mortifying youll know it when you see ityeah the violence is gratuitous as is the nature of the game and much of it does nothing whatsoever to advance the plot of a tv show there are no deathclaws the euphemisms are childish people magically bump into each other vault cousins diddle each other try not to cringe when any character makes any reference to sexon a positive note theres some good social commentary my favorite scene is when a community determines the best way to deal with psychopathic killers is to try to rehabilitate themyou can tell that the writers tried hard to make things seem funny but the funniest moment is a brief scene featuring fred armisen otherwise just admire the scenery
they really matched the tone and aesthetic of the games world design especially liked the backstory of the ghoul and introduction of the ncr the vault dwellers the bos the world of game translated to the screen better than i could have imagined going inoverall pacing of each episode was nearly perfect great balance between a and b plot lines and felt how they brought in backstories primarily the ghoul really added depth to the character in a believable wayas for the leads i had no idea whom any of them were before this show but they all nailed their roles ella purnell pulls of the naïveté of the vault dweller aaron moten gave humility to a bos knight and walton goggins as the ghoul steals every scene hes inthe guest stars were quite good as well as it was nice to see some familiar faces make cameosthe only thing that gives me some hesitancy is that with nolanjoy as executive producers it could turn into another westworld a show that i absolutely loved at the close of its first season and gave up after its second im leaning towards that not being the case as fallout does have some deep lore and more fan service left to cover

always skeptical about projects like this however fallout exceeded every expectationim a huge fallout fan played all the single player modern era games  nv   and from the very first episode it felt like i was watching fallout  the props staging characters the dialogue even the way the characters converse i was seeing dialogue trees in my head plus the camera angles looked like a fo conversation the feeling from the games is captured perfectly which is an achievement in itself they even managed to transition vats from the games in a subtle realistic but no less gory mannersound design was perfect if youve played the games youll recognise every single sound effect from the games from when lucy discovers a new location to the blink and youll miss it vats sound effects to mr handys spot on voicethe characters all felt like they were built around the role playing special system the games are known for lucy the good aligned naive noob fresh out the vault maximus the dim soldier who is in it for the power armor and then the ghoul the maxed level wastelander who just mercs everyone because hes been at it for so longalso as a hetero male the ghoul gave me confused feelings like how did they take a species known as basically decaying radiated zombies and turn one of them into this charismatic sexy monster you cant help but be endeared toi suppose a low point could be the story is pretty basic but like the games its about the adventure getting from a to b and all the side quests inbetween thou shalt get distracted by b every damn time no truer words spokenkudos to all actors and teams involved this is how a computer game to film adaptation should be doneive watched this series twice already and cant wait for the next season ive been revisiting the games as well happy wastelanding everyone
really enjoy this series the plot the characters the acting were really on point they really adapt perfectly the vibe from the games although there were some minor retcons and no im not talking about that one and some scenes that felt akward in their presentation they werent that big of a deal i was kinda worried in episode  and  cause i didnt liked them so much but after that they hit really strong and the finale was well done and it had major implications for the franchise going forward but we still dont know the whole picture so well see how they carry on in future seasons
have played the games since  and i think it hits the right tone and aesthetic the games have shifted and evolved with time but im surprised at how many other commentators claim the series isnt dark enough or too funny all the fallouts were weird especially the original isometric ones  and  the brotherhood of steel the vault dwellers raiders and quirky side characters are all true to the games the over the top gonzo violence and the retrofuture dystopia are also straight from the game the series song choices of s crooners set to a new context also is true to the game the weird macguffin story setting the vault dwelling protagonist out on a quest to the surface a quest she really doesnt understand the context for is also totally falloutso it works this is fallout they nailed the vibe spot on and the story and characters are well cast
i know people love the show and im happy for themi started my adventure with the series fallout  and  around the year  the show while going for the bethesda esthetics is quite close to the whimsical and satirical tone of the original games i respect thatbut it failed to involve me with its story i like the characters but the plot is a bit aimless full of side quests and random characters just like the games so by capturing the games vibes and esthetics very well the show failed to capture my interest i guess its ironic that i was tired of it being so close to the games but im looking for different stuff in games and shows it winked too much trying to say see we get thatthe casting is great and walton goggins is the highlight of the show lucy is lovely but i couldnt care less about her story only her brothers plot got me interested possibly because i like underdog characters and a bit of detectivemystery vibe knowing the games i was aware where it was going but still enjoyed itso for me it was a fun time but more like eating at a burger joint everything was fine but it didnt blow my socks offstill im happy so many people love it 
"having hundreds of hours playing the  true fallout games i was not looking forward to this  as a tv show cannot match the fun i had exploring this worldwell the people behind this have managed it somehowthis doesnt have total fidelity to the game lore but i think that was needed to make the transition between mediasthis pushes the comedy element quite hard but it worked for methe production is great and the characters are amazing ella purnell is perfect as is walton goggins and aaron moten  but everyone is greatthe only gripe i had was that the end battle was a little lacklustrebut overall i really enjoyed this and are anticipating the next season

i cut my teeth with fallout new las vegas but it is fallout  i really love this series captures essence of the fo world and does so in a way that makes you want more and not just tickle your memberberries the use of flashbacks to the world before compliments the present day storyi am a harsh critic of modern storytelling but the story building here is intriguing characters interesting with little issues that i would call foul in fact the only dialog issue i had was in episode  when maximus and lucy are in vault  holding cell lucy asks maximus if he wants to get it on her asking that and his response are totally uncalled for and has no place in the storymy only other critique the brotherhood isnt developed well and maximus place within them seems very strange although the actor playing maximus does a great job it seems they dont know what to really do with him one moment he is a likeable guy and another a future serial killer you know the quiet guy who stares creepily at youas i watch the series for a second time i would also add stop with all the cameos if they are not a main character dont use well known actors for bit rolesi look forward to season 
theres good and theres not so good things subjectively speaking ofc and the not so good things make me question if i want to continue after the second episodethe good  the plots arch sparks some interest by leaving some things hanging that engage the viewer the structure of the narration seems to work fairly well the world is build okay its not badthe not so good  the characters lack personal depth they feel like action movie characters fair enough this seems like largely action based series although somewhere labeled as drama the world could be more grim the humour often feels lazy unimaginative and immaturethis feels like an action game turned into a film not a film based on a game this feels shallow granted ive only played the two first fallout games so maybe this series stays more loyal to the latter ones but i really dont feel like this cartoonish actionbased approach would convey the spirit of the two first and beyond being a fallout game on a film this series seems to have little to offer to anyone else than the fans of the games
with close to  hours in fallout new vegas and just a bit shy of that total in fallout  i was a little nervous about watching this series so many disappointments from so many game related movies and tv shows in the past but i was more than pleasantly surprised by fallout the series and enjoyed all  episodesthough others complained about the atmosphere i found it very believable for californias southern coastline you arent going to get the urban sprawl of downtown washington d c nor are you going to get the bleached desert of new vegas instead get a lot of beach sand blown inland from the nuclear explosions covering the ruins of l a and its surrounding area the series stays away from a lot of dungeon crawling or wandering through the wrecks of buildings which actually only make up a small part of the gaming environment they did a very nice job of portraying the vaults which i really loved the depiction of brotherhood of steel was a little harsh at least to my tastes as i never encountered them being quite so harsh in either fallout  or new vegas but each chapter could be different depending on the circumstances surrounding it so i was able to accept thatthe genius of the series was the casting of walton goggins as cooper howard as he was spectacular in the part the rest of the cast was pretty good for a tv show but nobody really stood out ella purnell was good as the lead character but not great too much of a tendency to overact the cheesy vault girl parts aaron moten never really convinced me of his character until about episode  he just seemed bewildered and weak moises arias was very good in the small scenes that he had the rest of the case was just ok neither adding or subtracting much from the storyall in all though i found the series a very fun ride and hope they can keep it up for a second season
in my professional opinion this adaptation of a game into a movie or television series is the best one out there it provides a unique perspective akin to experiencing gameplay through the eyes of different characters this approach is likely to resonate with gamers and appeal to nongamers alike transcending the boundaries of gaming enthusiasts furthermore its broader appeal extends to science fiction enthusiasts ensuring wider audience appreciation all the actors have done justice to their roles the cgi could have been slightly improved in certain scenes but that may be overly critical
i dont have any prior knowledge when it comes to this show so my enjoyment of it was quite a surprise the writers did a great job setting the stage and giving novices a sense of this world the acting is stellar with interesting characters that grab you right away especially cooper lucy and maximus gets really nice to see leslie uggams on screen again she is great i havent finished the season it will be interesting to delve more into lucy and cooper and the groups in the bunker im really glad they went through coopers backstory and i hope that we get more about lucys father if and when she finds him
"long time i didnt enjoy a show like thisamazing from all aspect
i love it  waiting for  more season its not boring  alot of things happen in the same time  each episode somthing new  alot of creativity and idea  fun action masteries kind of showrecommended   tho i never play the game but i enjoy it alot  i try to play the game but its really old dated game i dont enjoy the graphiccast is amazing  everyone did his part  graphic is amazing  cant wait to see more of this show i feel sad when irs finish  this days u cant find a good quality show like this anymore so thank u "
my husband plays fallout so we were planning to watch it but i wasnt expecting much this show is my favorite and i was impressed with the story the style costumes scenery and special effects i think the actor playing the ghoul is amazing the casting director did a good job selecting the actors for the many unique roles i hope this awesome series wins many awards for best actoractress director makeup artists costume designers writersthere is something in this show for anyone there is action suspense a mystery romance comedy drama this series will keep you hookedcannot wait for next season
so far love this show the production quality is high theyve created an immense world not like the game but very similar it has great potential to expand the story lines if they continue with the current one i think itll be wildly successful the world has endless possibilities the end surprise was a but much it does touch on the evil ideology of transhumanism so thats a plus im surprised they put it in the show maybe the msm is trying to continue their psyop for future events at least that what it seems like with a trend in transhumanism being depicted im excited for another season
i just finished this series the writers took the goofiness of the games and copypasted it over into the show expecting game goofiness during horrific events to translate well over to show goofiness during horrific events this is a similar flavor as the horror comedy which i think is an abomination save a few rare examples like during a massacre one of the vault leaders is more concerned about the caterers bringing out the jello too early i mean hes literally being chased by a machete wielding maniac when he says this thats the kind of moodkilling cringe that peppers through this show you know that feeling where you get invested in a mediocre show and you know theres better things to watch out there but you arent invested in those youre invested in this mediocre show and you know its not going to get better but too bad youre invested thats what watching fallout felt likethe backgrounds effects and general world building is pretty cool and definitely captures that fallout vibe i give it a  because of the nostalgia but if i hadnt played the games then i imagine this would be a  or 
i am a big fan of the game series and this translated to screen seamlessly this truly feels like a mission in the game and its original the storyline feels fresh the cgi is incredible i commend bethesda studios for stepping intobrilliantly capturing the essence of its video game origins while delivering a fresh riveting narrative that stands firmly on its own this series which seamlessly blends drama action and intricate worldbuilding is a shining example of how to adapt a beloved game into a stunning television experiencethe character development is nothing short of exceptional each character is multidimensional with backstories and motivations that unfold organically throughout the series
the real star of the show is the production design which is spot on perfect and looks just like the game  it is whats holding the whole thing together walton goggins is another stand out as the ghoul he is the real protagonist if you ask me the other  main characters arent really that engaging and feel more tacked on to get the plot moving especially maximus who only seems to be there to justify having the brotherhood in there at allthey try to cram so many things into these  episodes that its hard to get attached to anything other than the guy who is present in nearly all of it the writing is okay at best and veers into marvelesque dialogue at worst the direction is mostly quite flat and boring but the story picks up towards the end with a few reveals that will have an interesting effect on the next game should they remember it  years down the roadall in all its not bad but theres a lot of wasted potential im still interested to see where they take it with the second season which is bound to be greenlit
before i say anything about fallout i want to correct all the people who keep thinking west worlds jonathan nolan created or wrote it he just directed the first three episodes thats it this show was created by a tv comedy writer and a film writer whose credits are generally unexceptionalnow on to the review of the first episode which is all ive watchedwhile the brilliant videogame fallout  established the premise and built the world quickly and threw you into an exciting world the tv series starts as an episodic mess theres a preapocalypse scene thats a decent beginning followed by  tedious minutes of scene building then some overthetop violence then a new uninteresting character in an uninteresting place then a tiny bit of plot movement and finally a little more violence at the end of over an hour of this there was literally nothing in the story or the characters that made me want to watch morethe movie is good looking the s soundtrack does a nice job of capturing the lostintime aspect of the world ella purnell seems like she might make a decent heroinebut it is beyond me why people are so ecstatic about this series i looked at reviews for episode  to see if maybe it was a lowrated episode compared to the rest but nope people really liked it and i didnt understand what they see that i dontmy recommendation is play fallout  which is amazing or perhaps one of the others but thats the only one ive played for reasons that have to relevance to this review but i cant recommend this show
as someone who has no knowledge of the games and has never played them i was a bit apprehensive going into this series i thought i would not understand a lot of it or that i even would outright dislike it however being the scifi nerd i am i instantly fell in love with the first episode overall i think the first and last episodes of the first season are the strongest where the middle  have meandering moments that follow a lot of the same postapocalyptic tropes of other films and series because of that i think this show could be better and it definitely has potential to do so but it was a great watch and should be entertaining to anyone who likes this vibe from a filmseries 
i am only currently at episode  but i have to say that the wait was worth it this perfectly depicts the world of fallout in all of horrible realism and grittinessthe events that i have seen so far while graphic is what i have always imagined would happen in a postnuclear apocalypse in the u s desperation depravity spiced up with the world within the vaulttec vault and the experiences of someone coming from that pristine environment to the endless horrors and hopelessness of the wastelands straight out of fallout    new vegas and fallout i purchased  months of amazon prime adfree just for fallout and i have to say it was money well spent
"fallout seriously impressed me i truly thought there was nothing good left out there i mean walton googins is just a beast id probably watch paint dry if he was the one doing the painting but seriously it has some potential everyone else is the cast started growing on me as well even the lead who i thought would have better played by the chick feom inside job and castle rock
there are definitely unanswered questions that the writers were able to push off to the second season so great for them but its nothing that ruined or made the season st cliffhanger unbearable i look forward to seeing what happens next season and how they pull everything together"
after playing the game and besides a wonderful cast of the best actors walton goggins aaron moten and ella parnell i dont think i have enough space to write it all definitely better than i imagined and love how they portray the game bethesda created a timeless product with fallout shelter so many years ago the timing today is sublime the ghoul is probably the attraction of the series because walter goggins is a genius my favorite character in the series justified ella and aaron also perfectly casted aaron captures the lost boy wanting to fit in and the ptsd from his childhood well ella is a convincing naïveté although shes a bit too cute still but that adds to the gaming experience because theres so much sarcasm in the game cant wait to see how the next season looks i hope they continue to frame this around the game experience i never took the theme of the game serious because it was just a fun way to pass time after seeing the series the theme for the game fallout shelter now seems pretty dark and evil its fun to watch some of these reviews are stupid and i realize its not to be taken as an accurate depiction of the game i played all versions of the games but at the end of the day i watch this stuff because im killing time between the drudgery of day to day just take it for what its meant to do and thats entertain its not a documentary about the apocalypse or real life its a game dammit
im not a diehard fallout fan played only new vegas so not gonna clutch the pearls over the show deviating from the loresource material in fact from what i heard in some cases that might even be a good thing when it comes to bethesdas takes on the franchisewhat i do care about is a solid story that has a fair amount of logic behind it and believable and sensible characters and in that regard the show is just a messthe plot is unnecessarily convoluted with past and present stumbling onto each other and most of the key characters motives remaining unclear pretty much up until the last episode of s which ends with a weak and ridiculous pop and after that a lot of questions are still left to the viewers best guesses and hopes that it will get resolved in the following episodesoverall i dont understand the allure of these types of twisted narrations where the viewer is supposed to not understand a good half of whats going on on the screen how is that satisfying to anybody why cant you just write some believable and relatable characters surviving in the wasteland making tough choices and leveling up just like the gameor take the boys  there is an element of mystery but most of it is pretty clear and fair to the spectator and that doesnt hurt the show for the acting scenery vfx camera work and gore with these writers and showrunners if the series goes on i assume it will only get worse
i have found in fallout a really good storytelling with wellinterpreted characters that on more than one occasion catch your interest and leave you wanting to know more i was truly surprised by the quality of the entire productionat some points the plot outcome was a bit more predictable than others but not in a way that spoils the story rather it felt logical frankly i am welcoming this adaptation with open arms for those reading this my key words are not disappointing give it a try and you might like it as well video games are definitely not easy to adapt into other media but in this case well done
"the problem with this is that the majority of positive reviews are from gamers who have grown up with the franchise to then see it blossom into a tvstreaming thing they absolutely love it its probably a wet dream for themive never played the game so its ok not great just okits a fairly decent story with multiple viewpoints and herovillain backstories thrown in the sets and visuals are as good as youd expect from a big budget tv show although there is nothing new or overly special as i guess they were trying to stick to the game environmentsthe story is captivating for the first few episodes then you lose interest the series is all aiming towards a big culmination which never quite gets there so amazon can do another seriesits good could be better i
ve got to the end and thought its not worth the  odd hours i put in to it probably wont watch the next series"
weak as hell the first episode grabs your attention with compelling concept and decent acting but the premise wears thin almost immediately couldnt take more than  minutes of the second episode before i had to shut it off for a show based on a video game youd think they would have the resources to utilize cg where needed instead one of the main focal points of the show is a knight just geeky powerarmor click bait lumbering around in a comicon grade suit ridiculously clunky and slow every movement looks laborious and weak straining just to take a step one second then in the next shot propelling another character superhero style hundreds of feet at one point the suit is attacked by a wild irradiated bear that apparently has adamantium claws as it leaves huge gashes in the metal armor just awfuldecent acting from a couple of the characters decent casting choices and decent production values hence the three star rating but ludicrous premises gigantic plot holes clunky pacing and generally just unim happy this is fulfilling the expectations of the fans but for anyone not blinded by their allegiance to the series this is week tea
never played the game but when i started watching this show i was hooked  best character for me was ghoul he got the style and charisma cinematography is amazing i could have done with more scenes with different creatures but i am hoping that could happen in next season there was no forced foreshadowing and everything came out naturally scenes in the past were well integrated with future events the way show depicts antagonists actually makes you feel angry and frustrated with them unlike most of other shows where it is just old washed up motives this show could be best adaptation of a game by far
so with standards set fairly low from previous series stemming from video games i wasnt expecting much but surprisingly this was a really good series the sfx in this is amazing to get things to look how you would imagine should you play the gamesthe good a good storyline thats fun and easy to follow theres no episodes which drag on or you find boring sometimes in series theres action in the first  episodes then the rest is fairly dull theres alot of things set in season  that leave you eager to learn more in season  not just leaving the story just chasing  thing over and overif youve played the games theyve put alot of references in from the game franchise even down to the little details like weapons and food from the gamesthe bad there really isnt any
"i mean it this is by far the best video game adaptation ever its actually still very hard to believe that its as good as it is its in my opinion far superior to the overhyped critically acclaimed tlou adaptation by hbo see my review of that show for whyour main characters
 lucy maclean ella purnell is an absolute treat her acting is fantastic and her giant eyes and soft voice fit perfectly with the character shes playing she looks like a vaulttec bobble head turned into the cutest girl in the best possible way shes not the stereotypical disney strong woman trope that everyone is sick and tired off instead she is still incredible capable and combat trained but also very femine at the same time generally shes not unrealistically strong in combat shes not throwing around men twice her size with ease but she can defend herself is a very good shot and uses her wit charm and also her lawful good personality to survive strangely everyone but maximus seems to ignore her good looks in the wasteland when i imagine its rare to see someone that pretty its a breath of fresh air to see a woman as the protagonist be feminine in a show again the ghoul aka cooper howard mr goggins delivers absolute gold as always the ghoul is a relentlessly brutal character who has at the start lost most of his humanity we later learn his drive to live comes from the fact that hes looking for his family the acting is incredible as always the makeup and cgi for his ghoul version look great maybe a little smooth cooper has no chill hes not just quick to defend himself but also to kill innocents with no remorse  years in the savage wastelands have turned him into something that isnt a monster but has little humanity left no sympathy for anyone and a singular drive to the point where he eats former friends for substanance kills those offering him a job and even after lucy shows him a kindness her golden rule treat others as youd want to be treated and saves him after he tries to sell her to organ harvesters tortures her and even cuts her finger off he murders a young boy in cold blood infront of his father and child sister after he taunts him about having murdered his older brother earlier goating the kid into pulling a rifle when in reality a rifle bullet seems to literally do nothing to cooper which is kind of a problem ghouls in the show have rapid healing abilities and cooper esp seems to be indistructable but the rules arent clear maximus aaron motens maximus is probably the weakest link mainly because his acting feels so inconsistent and at first i couldnt put my finger on it its like hes cycling through emotions or facial expressions constantly and its very distracting in more emotional scenes this kinda looks unhinged for example the interrogation scene he looks like hes about to snap to a point that i thought it was the point that he was going to snap and turn into some brotherhood zealot radical and an antagonist use everyone around him as a ladder to reach his goals instead hes an insecure guy looking for a place to belong and looking to be a hero to save people which is fine great even but his acting just never felt right and i think i get why that is after having seen some interviews with him hes very very feminine in his mannerisms and facial expressions in real life and in the show his character is trying to act a lot more masculine and straight but his true self keeps breaking through his acting the behavior i confused for cycling through emotions was him making his natural facial emotions but then changing them to fit his role more but not always being able to keep the face straight he will constantly slightly protrude his upper or lower lip and have this weird stare in certain scenes one of the worst examples and also one of the worst scenes in the whole show is the scene where lucy offers to sleep with him and i think hes supposed to look shocked a little scared and shy but instead he comes off like hes a little girl weirdly pouts his lips and pulls his shoulders together etc and the dialogue being ridicilously infantile doesnt help with some guys their penis grows and explodes like a pimple or something what hes an adult man he lives in barracks with men women trans people etc in fact in one scene a guy is clearly mastrubating under the covers there is no way in hell a man wrote that line in fact right after writing that i checked the writer for the episode and its a lady called karey dornetto they really need to stop this nonsense where they have every episode written by a different writer it makes the showstory feel super inconsistentthe writing
its really good at many parts for example a lot of the comedic bits and humor were great some of the lines are fantastic but its also horrifically bad at other times and i mean beyond how weird it is that lucy would casually asks maximus to sleep with her in a room with a giant window in a strange place surrounded by strange people i thought it was funny she was asking about sperm count etc in the vault but that made sense just randomly inviting people to have sex with no protection etc in that weird condition was that supposed to be empowering or something or just a set up for the pimple penis joke or maximus later asking if shed like to explode his d now beyond all that the motivations for none of the antagonists make any sense the corporations vaulttec wants to wipe out all the competition on a larger scale wipe out literaly every faction country group political entity and organization so there wont be anyone to fight or compete anymore total domination by one group one faction vaulttec how by a nuclear holocaust by dropping the bombs themselves but thats just part of the plan they know it wont wipe out everyone their plan is to wait for it wait it out their plan is that everyone on the surface eventually dies how time but  that makes no sense theyd multiply and start rebuilding naturally right nope dont think about it the greatest weapon of mass destruction is time according to vaulttec in this show but it gets better vaulttec then invites all their competitors to join in on the fun because obviously the best way to end competition is to tell your competition of your plans an invite them to join you in the new future youre planning to create but wasnt the point  that thered be no more factio shhhh dont think about it oh and the vault experiments well those are now made up by different corporations for their own end goals that they are allowed to choose for some reason in the game lore its the enclave who was convinced the nuclear war would was inevitable and would make the world uninhabitable so they planned to create multi generation star ships and colonize different planets most of the vaults were meant as experiments to see how people would last in long term confinement and or to create some super human species etc etc and a small amount of them were control groups and thus had no experiments etc going onlisten im fine with the corpos dropping the bomb even though it ruins the ambigiouty we had about who dropped them i dont mind vault tecs somewhat cartoony power hunger and motivations thats totally fine in fallout but the bad writing the plotholes the inconsistency  thats unacceptable these people are supposed to be professional writers and they couldnt come up with something better or just stuck to the game lore same for characters its ok for them to be whacky and over the top its fallout but there is a limit to what works and what is just infantile and dumb lucys parents so lucys dad is a lower level cog in the vaulttec machine and hes assigned to live his life out in a vault herding the flock all the vault  people are cryopod people from before the bomb this doesnt seem enough of a revelation for vault  to break out into a full on civil war and massacre each other but that does seem to be the extent of itmoldavers talk about lucys mom rose was cringe worthy oh how smart and mary sue she was she inferred from the vault losing water that it was being siphoned she didnt assume it was a leak or anything no it had to be that civilization had restarted and their water was being siphoned by them how did they siphon the  water of a vault wouldnt that be a design fla dont think about it youre not supposed to think look im not looking for much logic but what and then when she tells her husband and he says  probably just a leak she figures hes must be hiding something in a vault full of people that are bred to be docile and nice to each other she has no idea whats there it might be a leak it might be a bunch of monsters or raiders the radiation is still there etc etc what does she do she takes her children and  leaves the vault she takes her children to an irradiated wasteland to live in an irradiated town among mutants raiders murderers and under constant threat of monsters other factions radiation etc its implied she has a romantic relationship with moldaver and that shadysands was this super great perfect place where civilization had thrived etc what i mean sure there was more safety than other places and the ncr was in power etc but it was still the fallout world with raiders and tons of hostile factions cannibals ghouls monsters radiation in every part of the world etcthe father than get this goes and takes the children and then he nukes the town how does a mid level management tool from a corpo nuke a whole town you ask dont because were never told he just doesthere is much more but it appears weve run out of the characer limit overall i really enjoyed the show but it could have been so much better"
whether you are a fan of the games or know nothing about them fallout does an amazing job satisfying both types of viewers the creators of the series made the brilliant decision to create a new story in the fallout universe that can coexist with all the games director writer and producer jonathan nolan made it clear that he didnt want to drastically change any of the established lore but instead contribute to it and he accomplishes that goal remarkablywe follow  main characters on their journeys across the remnants of southern california in a retrofuturistic nuclear fallout the switching of perspectives from across a  year period of time is done often but the transitions are seamless and warranted all the characters connect with each other in ways that feel natural some of the story arcs are deceivingly complex while others are mysterious in nature which will have you wanting to start a new episode as soon the current one youre on ends even the side stories involving supporting characters were compelling and led to some of the best moment in the entire seasonthe action humor and drama in the series is evenly placed prime video spared no expense when it came to the costume design graphics and post apocalyptic alternate history settingfallout proves you can tell an original story without changing the core of the material to attract new viewership in sticking with this idea prime video set a new standard for future video game adaptions to follow
"eh where do we beginbased on a game series i love and the show so far is great earns an mostly because it doesnt seem to knacker the lore completely and at the most adds a wealth of characters that are worth followingif anything it makes one like me ask questions and wonder  which is a good recipe in my bookto the uninitiated to the games its probably a weird mash of fun confusion and maybe a bit of an acquired taste but reckon it should prove fairly entertaining to the target crowda lot happens relationships are built things get killed  run of the mill maybe but a quality execution nonethelessnonetheless 
id say or hope season one is a testing ground for such an ambitious project and it really seems to be as far as i can telli cant deny that there are quite a few things from the game series i would have expected to see  such as
energy weapons  what no lasers not even with the bos being very prominent 
stealth boy  norm cudda used onemore creatures  a gulper hmmmm
robots  just a mr handy hmmmmyet i get the constraints no easy job pulling all of this off for the game fans only so much you can dooverall it was properly entertaining with much to laud introduced new stuff to the lore that makes fair enough sense had quite a few great setpieces and brought in characters that catch your attention especially like lucy  as if level  on leaving the vaults and maybe level   by the end of the serieshope they continue this arc reckon shell be a top level courierlikechosenone badass by the end perhapsbut til then its just season one and well worth a watch  and perhaps a rewatch toomaybe season two will earn a  but it will need lasers"
i love the actors and they do a great job but without knowing the history of the video game it misses people like me i realize the phenomenal gamers may be enthusiastic about the video game being made into a tv show but sadly i missed the boat the tv show didnt do enough to get me the nongamerviewer up to speedi understand that this tv series is base on a video game but this is not a video game at this vantage point it is a tv series and this tv series does not deserve anything past a  an  makes me the think the writer creator or their friends were the ones voting this series is good but it is not spectacular who is rating this tv show please educate those of us that are not gamers but love the actors
first of all you dont need to have played the game to watch the showthe series was set up perfectly to stand alone as well as having tonnes of references for fans of the gamethe set costumes and characters are fantastic each episode draws you in my partner and i ended up watching the full series within a couple of nights as a fan of the game he was very impressedwalton goggins plays such a great role as the ghoul hes brilliant in other things ive watched like predators  sons of anarchy so i was so excited to see him in this hes definitely my favourite characterella purnell played lucy so well loved seeing her in a lead role after yellowjackets i love the dynamic between lucy  the ghoulso excited for a season 
sorry for all the fans ive never play the game this show is good but i feel like they didnt dive enough into the personalities of the character the conversations arent very interesting it feels a bit like a soap show i literally forced myself to finish the show because i saw the great reviews and was hoping for a chocking ending and i wasnt astonished but i truly loved the location and the movie set it felt like it was a tv show from an other time you cant feel that humans lived on this planet a while ago thumbs up to the crew am i the only one feeling like this show is overrated 
fallout has all the makings of a great show it has a talented cast a big budget and a team of experienced writers and producers but somehow the show manages to be both boring and forgettablethe problem is that fallout is all style and no substance the characters are all onedimensional stereotypes and the plot is predictable and cliched the show also suffers from a serious case of tonal whiplash veering wildly from comedy to drama to action without any real sense of cohesionas a result fallout is a show that is easy to watch but difficult to care about you might find yourself watching an episode and then immediately forgetting everything that happened its the kind of show that youll never bingewatch or even rewatchits a shame that fallout is such a disappointment with all the talent and resources behind it it should have been a lot better but instead its just another forgettable entry in the evergrowing sea of tv shows
this show was lifechanging for me i genuinely think it was perfect simultaneously creating its own story while pulling elements from the games the story building and the character writing is phenomenal and the actorsactresses fit their roles so well and played their characters to perfection ella purnell walton goggins aaron moten and moisés arias were the perfect leads and i cant wait to see them in the next season the score was amazing as well of course the buildup to the season finale was suspenseful and kept you wanting more and the finale itself was powerful and epic i highly recommend if you are a fan of the games or dystopian stories in general
dont worry if youve never played any of the numerous fallout games that there have been over the years the team who made this series have got you covered with some great back story flashbacks if you are a fan of the games then i suspect you might fall in love with this series like i didno spoilers here  just a simple review the plot is based around survivors of the great war which pretty much ended civilisation for those not selected to be saved in one of dozens if not hundreds of underground bunkers this is their story seen from various different character perspectivesthe visual effects are right up there with the very best and you could well believe that you are actually looking at postapocalyptic america various landmarks such as lax airport appear and the visuals take your breath away absolutely fantastic the scenery is awesome and there are nods to the game everywhere from the pip boy wrist terminals to the guns armour and the prewar cars and americana well done for keeping us gamers happyoh and the music its like diamond city radio on the big screen
how can i give less than  to the great world adaptation of my favorite game everything shines there items weapons clothing everything look exactly as in the game the atmosphere and characters and the same blood and humor as in the game i was wondering if they include even such extreme things as cannibalism and they did lucy is my character particularly when she went out from the super duper mart in that light leather armor with my favorite mm pistol looking exactly as in the game also i felt the influence of the mods on the plot when i saw vault  it really reminded me one of the best mods i played in general the atmosphere of the series makes it all yes i agree there maybe some plot holes and the characters do not always act rationally or seriously but again this is all about fallout which has never meant to have a linear plot and rational characters the acting is great the bad ghoul is probably taken from one of the mods as well but it looks exactly as he should be after watching the whole season i can highly recommend it to anyone adult enough for this those who has never played the games particularly fallout  may not appreciate it enough moreover there are many things in the series which assume that you played the game otherwise they may be not understood but nonetheless the series are great on their own now waiting for the second season and hoping the scenery will be boston with its institute
a series we fans have been wanting for a long time and whilst only just started it myself so far it has surpassed all expectations i held for thisfrom the outfits to weapons and locations im truly in awe for what we have recievedamazon went all out to make this as close to the game series as possible whilst set in the same universe it has its own unique cast and set of characters kudos to the cast and crew for making this a fabulous fallout tv adaptationso far i can only praise what this show is and im both amazed and blown away if youve never played the games even i think this would be a series youd enjoy and one i recommend to you
this series was a wonderful surprise i thought after the first two episodes that it was not going to grab me but it did from episode  onward there is something about a video game that makes me at least think that there can be no humanity about it but the lead actors bring great emotion to the series i was more than impressed with ella purnell and walton goggins in particular they were the twin bridges that made a video based series real and it had some not so subtle connections to the dystopian world we currently may be creating i am disappointed that apparently we will have to wait until  to see season  i hope there is something that can be done about that anyone out there listening
lets just get this out of the way tv adaptations of beloved movieanimevideo game franchises often suck and our expectations have been lowered so far that theyre buried next to dinosaur dirt consequently surpassing that bar is not a very tall orderthat said fallout  is a breath of fresh air in the endless hell of streaming adaptations were forced to endure yearafteryearby far the greatest praise of this show is that it nails the tone the fallout franchise is such a specific blend of pax americana retrofuturism and postapocalyptic dark comedy that this series seemed doomed to fail as no one but bethesda has been able to replicate that tone in such a specific way like many others i believed this would just be another halfassed cash grab preying on the nostalgia of middleaged gamershowever i was pleasantly surprised when i found myself eagerly jumping to the next episode the tone is absolutely perfect although the mad maxesque future is grim and downright horrifying at times its subtle blend with comedy and humanity is  spotonsomehow surely by black magic or otherworldly incantations the show isnt a total mess heck its even downright enjoyable at times the characters are properly developed and experience real narrative arcs throughout the season motivations make sense and there are real stakes for our antiheroes the sets and costumes are high quality genuinely livedin and believable there is actual visual style and thought behind the cinematography clearly the creators held the games in high regard and fans will certainly smile along seeing this homage play out on the screenthough there is much praise it still manages to fall into some of the familiar trappings of generic streaming tripe hence the  some characters and motivations inevitably fall flat while gore seems to unabashedly flourish in this postapocalyptic hellscape the ever looming prudish censorship of the fcc makes this story a largely loveless one chemistry between main characters is always played for laughs with no intent to establish any kind of serious connection between our protagoniststhere is also what i considered to be some filler episodes while this ties in nicely to fallouts theme of constantly getting distractedsidetracked by random nonsense the joke does wear a little thin when we only have  episodes to explore this specific story if instead they wouldve spent this time further fleshing out the characters i believe the narrative payoffs would have been much more significantallinall it was a very enjoyable evening spent watching this show praise amazon for releasing it all at once fans of the game will surely find themselves engaged and get a few laughs even the uninitiated will likely bond with the main characters over their struggles and triumphs in this nightmarish vision of a postnuclear american wastelandimo worth watching at least the first episode or two for anyone curious if you find yourself chuckling along with the dark humor  you may want to give the fallout series a chance
overall word building and set design was excellent you can clearly tell johnathan nolan and co are fans of the property acting is passable with a couple no so great performances that may have more to do with lackluster writing than fault of the actors walton goggins brings tons of charisma and his performance as the ghoul is one of the shows biggest strengths i really liked lucy as a character and ella purnell plays a naive cando attitude well as she develops more into a tough capable survivor the maximus character is where the shows falters a bit the actors performance can be a bit grating compared to goggins and purnell overall as someone with surface level experience with the fallout franchise i enjoyed the first season and feel they can build on this going forward
the promotional videos released prior to the premiere of the show did it a slight disservice leading many to prematurely conclude that it would be disappointingi myself was among the skeptics fortunately i decided to give the show a chance and im glad i didwhile its not without its flaws the series stands out for its originality a quality that many shows today seem to lack it consistently introduces fresh and interesting plot devices that ensure it never becomes dull or boring moreover it possesses the potential to evolve into a masterpiece in future seasonsi highly recommend watching it
almost finished and i am annoyed with all the reviews so fari hate the s that blindly praise it and the s that say its nothing like the game i am going to assume that they are only loosely familiar with the franchise because it seems pretty close to the world that i was expecting it feels pretty close to fallout in my mindi also dont love itthe closest negative review was a comment about the graphics the graphics are rough in spots but that isnt the problemthe problem is pacingvery quickly we are introduced with a mcguffin its very well handled and the first couple of episodes present it in a very solid way then it disappears say around episode around episode  we are introduced to some much needed background about the world i like this part as wellso i liked  and  why is there a problemthey are different stories season  is the first four great season  is the second four also great but make clear arcsthis  feels like they were trying to emulate a game here is the introduction part of the game we are like all games stuck on the railroad of storytelling that introduces the mcgufffin then something happens and the world opens upsome players just grind after the mcguffin and keep it going some players wander and explore creepy buildings i personally explore creepy buildings its what i enjoy its why i enjoyed the second act but now i am unsatisfied i reached the end of six and realized that they were going to be only able to finish one of the two story arcs in the time remainingohyay another cliffhanger i guess i saw it coming at least dont get me wrong i understand the need and they just didnt stick the landing that  episode segment is roughi have no problem with a genuinely episodic show i have no problem with a major story driven show but you have to be a masterclass genius to get your cake and eat it
i must be going insane because i literally cannot fathom how this show has gotten anything over  by any reputable criticthe first episode was somewhat engaging but towards the end and pretty much everything after that began to feel like i was watching an amateur theatre youth groups attempt at a video game parody the acting is absolutely atrocious from pretty much every character the plot is uninteresting the cgi is terrible and the pacing is all over the placei really hope some people with brains start watching this so the reviews start to match its actual quality because i wasted  hours of my life on this thanks to the ratings it receivedas a longtime fan of the fallout series im really disappointed that they couldnt find more than one competent actor for the show
the series is a masterpiece it captures the essence of the fallout universe flawlessly the humor the hidden plotlines the depth of sadness in a postapocalyptic world the stark reality of a lawless societythe complete fallout package in a series iconic characters with their own motives and goals wellwritten character arcseverything youd expect from the fallout universenow speaking of direction its simply impeccable the soundtrack use of color camera positioning performances costumes though i must say the pipboy and armor didnt quite convey the impression of being made of steel they seemed more like rigid foam the settingits evident that no expense was spared in creating this masterpiecei cant thank enough for having the pleasure of watching this incredible series if youve played the games its your duty to watch the seriesthank you to all the directors and executives who brought this work of art to life
from the very first episode to the last every single minute of this show is absolutely captivating the entire thing is so well done i am in awe of just how they were able to pull everything off and it absolutely makes me want a new fallout single player game the very last episode that little plot twist i definitely didnt see that coming  my jaw hit the floor i cannot wait to see what they do in new vegas because that was a perfect game and is still very much playable to this day so i can only imagine what the writers are gonna do with that material hopefully one of these days there will be a k bluray of the series that way i can own a physical copy of it and not just have to rely on amazon servers all the time just this entire series has literally changed my perspective on everything in the real world corporations will do anything that they have to do to appease their investors including selling blood clotting vaccines the implications presented in this show definitely have far reaching effects if this show doesnt open your eyes to whats going on around you in the real world then you are a sheep for sure
this is the only video game to film adaptation that has ever been made that is actually likeable and it goes past likeable to freaking amazing cant wait till season i love all the little details in it that gives easter eggs or head nods to the video game and the writing is soo fallout like that i can see todd howard was definitely involved with the writing and directing this is probably one the if not the best show ive seen so far this entire year if you havent watched it but have played a single fallout game its a must watch if you like action comedy and great world building its a must watch
i am a crusty fallout player who has experienced all games from fo on and im one of those people who like fallout  fallout  and new vegas better than  and  by a long shot after  i expected that every brain cell behind this property had died i was also not looking forward to following some bland everyman hero instead of the kind of builds people actually make in the games that let you roleplay and boy was i wrongthe lucy and norm from the vault are exactly like the int builds i favor the morally bankrupt gunslinging ghoul goggins is almost one for one the kind of guy i made for a fresh new vegas run to spice things up after i got tired of being a science hero the brotherhood is a faction im actually burnt out on and tired of i think im in the fan minority here but i rolled my eyes whenever the brotherhood was shoehorned into a plot line so maximus was a revelation for me hes perfect hes an exact spotlight into everything wrong with the brotherhood which they breathed new life into by making them morally grey and screwed up i really liked them showing a wide eyed kid admiring a shiny idealized brotherhood he made up in his head only for the helmet to be ripped off in the rudest of ways i also like how hes flawed and less than he appears but that seems to go for everyone involved with his faction hes actually interesting to watch and i thought it was impossible for me to give a flys fart in space about anything brotherhoodi love lucy too its nice to see someone wide eyed and inexperienced who isnt a wimp by a long shot her brother norm is also great if i was honest with myself he acts how id probably act stuck in a vault hes oh so wonderfully and terribly relatable i love checking in on him and the wonderfully creepy people watching him from time to timeone note as i said im an old fan who expected to hate this and so far its nuked my expectations harder than it nuked shady sands i dont really get the people who had a fit about this it made sense and this is a dark setting even as a huge new vegas fan i dont understand the canon fears either new vegas is an old game you can still boot up any time im glad the show isnt completely shackling itself to old lore like bethesda does thats whats been making the newer games so bland with any luck theyll hire some writers for this for the next actual game and quit focusing on shovelware like 
like anybody else i havent been immune from the overflow of tv series of the last decade  of the times they are too slow and even the most celebrated no namescough game of thrones cough are extremely boring it takes for five episodes for  small thing to happen fallout is on another level the plot is interesting evey episodes carries both news and action and the show follows a number of characters all of whom have an interesing background and let the viewer ask himherself about what will happen next in the storyline any environment and artifact is made with a realism that could compete with a movie and at a level of quality which is way above your regular series overall this series is a real gem so good that my highest hope is that they dont screw up season  pls dont make endless seasonsthe never endingness of tv series leaks inevitably in borerdom at some point

as a fan of the games the first thing i want to say the story was better than fallout  but the characters did not leave much of an impression they were too bland except for the ghoul and lucy the rest were very forgettable but the ghoul really left an impression like he was a veteran from the games and lucy was like someone first time playing but in a good waythey captured the feel of the world of fallout exceptionally well even the weapons which i wished to see more from the games but what they didnt capture very well were the monsters of fallout that felt lacking to me at least also the lack of a deathclaw was very disappointing to methe last episode was kind a weird to me with the whole revelation stuff and the part with who dropped the bombs just felt like stupid writing to me and wished they just stuck to the lore
i really didnt want to watch this show i had no real interest in watching a show adapted on a game that i had never played however my husband had it on and after around  minutes i was already hookedthere is so much to love about it the sound track is really enjoyable especially if you love the s the acting and plot are both great in my opinion nothing lets this show down we didnt want to stop watching unfortunately sleep and working got in the way of thatim very excited for season  i honestly think that this is one of the best series i have ever seen and im pleased that i gave it a chance i really dont think you have to be a gamer to appreciate this but obviously if youve played fallout you probably have a little more insider knowledgehighly recommend this show  episodes is not enough
this is a show made by people who love the fallout franchise so much that everything else becomes something of an afterthought much like how the main character in the the star wars prequels is the universe itself it is also true here while that may be fine for star wars since it is a culturally defining piece of media where those films were basically complementary additions to the original trilogy fallout is the first liveaction of its kind and for all the success the games have had over the years it falls short of that esteem so it doesnt worki dont want to give the impression this is a bad show its not i did enjoy myself much of the humor lands and the dangers found on the road plus game references were all quite fun costume and set design were also superb but the hyperfocus on the setting really took away from characters and actual storytelling lucy who is arguably the main character of the show conforms far too much to her specifically engineered upbringing to stand out instead of adding to her characterization she ends up blending into the background because of it if the writers wanted to make her a real person she should have broke or strayed away from her conditioning in a consequential way but she doesnt also maximus gets a mention for being extremely unlikeable and became ever more so as the series progressed just when you think he finally has a backbone after finding something to fight for he shows you he is the same as he ever was this is a shame because moten is a talented convincing actor everyone outside of the ghoul was relatively bland and generic but you cant focus on him either because he is more part of the setting than someone for the audience to relate to the point is you basically get no one to root for not even the main characters and develop zero emotional attachments to anything outside of it being a fallout show when that hits home the heavyhanded overuse of oldies music amidst gratuitous violence while traversing the wasteland ends up feeling a little cheap and transparent it happens too often which reveals itself to be a targeted attempt at game nostalgia this should be complementary to things of substance not observed at the forefront by default because those things are not thereadditionally what we see over the span of eight episodes doesnt stand on its own i had thought the main plot reveal at the end would accomplish this but it doesnt the entire thing is one big buildup to new vegas i like expansive arcs that cross multiple seasons but not at the expense of what youre currently watching it must be a complete and weighty experience on its own this is not and if you think so ask yourself if it would have been fine for it to have ended here altogetherill likely watch the following season but wont be anywhere near as excited as i was for this one
"yes its fallout yes the visuals are great yes they got the theme almost right but come on like every series in the last  years this one also has horrible writers cliches premade dialogues scenes that are copypasted from other shows etc etcit gets annoying the first lucy scene opens up with the stupidplot written all over it plot holes logical things that nobody does because it would break the super thin credibility they want to create with the story yayy external visitors but they all smell they look bad their manners are questionable nobody raise a question but then the girl finds out they got radiation on them so nobody did a check before they all had their pipboys on were they all brokenthis is the disney version of fallout where bad guys are extremely recognisable by the audience so they can scream oh nooo watch oooout
but im too old for this stuff and thats why i liked the plot in the games it wasnt straight black and white it wasnt predictable it was gritty and adult and always looking in the shades of greymodern streaming shows are all like this and i cant stomach them anymore"
as the title  played the game or not  watch the show you do not need to have played the show to watch and enjoy how good this show is they do a good job building into it with the information needed they do a excellent job with character development as well and keep you invested for those who have played the game you will enjoy and feel like you are back in the game as it really does it justice there was not one disappointing episode as they all kept you hooked we are already waiting for the next season and cant wait to see what happens next in the wasteland give it a chance you wont regret it
honestly its hard for a show or film to make a game come to life in a live action and i think fallout is a  showyes you hear people say  where are the death claws wheres this and that oh whats cannonwho cares its only one season and id much prefer to not have everything smashed together from all the games into a season or episode the small nods and usage of references were amazing not over done and used wellthe story i loved and although i found lucys story to be great i loved howards story i personally hope he stays more of the main focus next seasoni think the writers and directors should just repeat what they did and keep it going keep it fresh but also dont steer away from the sourcethe show also makes a great watch for someone who hasnt played the games
"i have played most of the fallout games since fallout  and i can attest to their deep emotional resonance and the scarring they leave once you wander the wastelands and observe the tattered remnants of humankind  years in the future scrambling to get out of the primordial muck the great war createdamazon has knocked it out of the park with this series the ambiance and atmosphere of the games are reproduced down to the bottle caps vast destroyed vistas incredible violence savage radiation mutated creatures of nightmares the horrors of failed vaultsits all here the great factions of this destroyed war are well represented barely scratching the surface of their depth even the beloved gas station is recreated to the finest detail as fans of fallout  will attestella purnell is incredible as the protagonist of singular courage who dares to leave the comfort of her vault to face the harsh world her transformation from a naive sheltered daddys girl to a capable survivor is interesting to watch especially as she resists losing her instinct to do the right thingwalton goggins plays the quintessential cowboy ghoul immortal and haunted by the ghosts of betrayal centuries past his antihero personality makes him all the more genuine and credible fitting for such a harsh worldaaron clifton plays a struggling squire seeking to become a knight and his character development arc is also impressive honor and duty matter and he shows a genuine struggle in this regardits disturbing yet comforting to see the desperation of the survivors eking out an existence in this hellscape that never recovered  years after the great war their grit and determination optimism and bravado are formidable as chet said aptly we are all cowards thats why we live in a vault
as with all fallout games the charming soundtrack is exemplary all the great oldies are used in just the right places with the right tone and theme"
ive never played the games so i went into fallout with zero expectations it blew my mind like a nuke the production quality scripting and casting is excellent the satire is hilarious and horrifying at the same time as it presents a possible vision of a post apocalyptic future are we on a path to world war  and the end of civilisationthe retro scifi feel is cool the characters are very engaging and i found myself caring about them like got bad things happen to them the action is often brutal and graphicfallout is a show which people i know and work with are talking about like when got was a social phenomena a lot of people dont subscribe to prime but the attraction of this show is so strong many will startit will make stars out of some of the actors annabel ohagan for example who plays tragic supporting character stephanie has a presence and a smile which is magnetic and heart meltingthe boys is great but with fallout prime video finally has a show which can draw an audience like got
as an avid fallout player i was both excited and a bit worried to hear about the show it seems like many of the recent adaptations have fallen flat and abandoned aspects of the original material which were vital to the essence of what made it special happily the show exceeded my expectations and kept the violent fun retro atmosphere great casting plot costumes makeup set design and perhaps most importantly music overall the show was very well done and remained true to the imagery of the game albeit with some points i think could have been done differently with better effect ad victoriam
this is one of those shows that could have been excellent however it misses the mark by introducing all sorts of silly comedic ploysi didnt know anything about this story before watching its an interesting concept and provides an engaging story at times the writing is somewhat serious and touches on a thoughtworthy concept and then something silly happenscomedy and thoughtprovoking concepts dont mix yet this show attempts to deliver both and fails predictablyill never understand why writers believe this will ever work youre dealing with two completely separate and opposite emotions so why try to combine them its like trying to make someone laugh and cry at the same time you cant really do both if somethings sad its not funny and if its funny its not sad ill never understand the desire to cater to opposite emotionsits because of the silly antics that i could never recommend this show to anyone the silliness bleeds over into some of the characters  particularly one i understand that writers want to portray this slick tough overthetop character however its not realistic which hurts the credibility of the showbattlestar galactica was far from perfect however it made a greater attempt to be serious because of this its a better show overall fallout has an excellent concept to explore its just too bad that the creators couldnt help themselves by interjecting jokes and foolishnessi can only imagine what this show would have been had it decided to take a more serious realistic approach like some of the episodes of black mirror had it done that it could have been a golden classic
it was just like watching a very well made high budget scifi action movie i mean the whole series i never expected it to be such entertaining action pouredit startes very quickly with magnificent scenes and actions which is more than enough to make your blood boil and pull you into the series then it slows down little bit to give some space to character development and to introduce the back story nevertheless it dose not forget mixing some action scenes in between too so that you dont get bored muchand most importantly the story is very well written good beginning and development and mesmerising ending again im really surprised wish there are more movies or series like this these days
is it bad no far from it to be honest but the little things i dont like it about it really get to me the first and main thing i dislike is the character maximus he almost makes it unwatchable hes a liar a hypocrite and somehow has the best luck with essentially zero skill i honestly hope they kill him off another thing i dislike is the cringy humor that happens every so often some of the humor is good but other times it feels similar to marvels attempt at jokes i hope the humor gets darker the next season other than that its a great show excellent set design music is perfect action is great
if you love this because its a competent liveaction adaption of the video game franchise you love more power to you ive played one fallout game and even that only a short way in im not grading on the nostalgiakick curvethis show was okay on some levels the acting was solid the effects and aesthetic are nice it definitely reminds me of the game almost too much at times as it almost felt like there were alot of video game references put in that destroyed any sense that this might be a real place or storythe action is also fine but nothing special or particularly well done there seemed to be a certain glee in the gore and shock value of the violence rather like walking dead this glee seemed really out of place given the messaging of the showthe character work is the closest thing to interesting going on in the show lucy and maximus each come to the plot with their own brand of naivete and it is through their eyes that we learn about the world lucy i felt was handled better than maximus but they were both fine nothing exceptional just finebut then we get to the message there are no more overwrought overused hollywood tropes than the hyperviolent movie that pretends its antiwar because it says soeven as it profits off of war and the simplistic anticapitalist messageeven as the show shamelessly stamps out licensed franchise content from a video game is there any less selfaware show than fallout name one you cant do itwhat is particularly galling is the incredible lack of subtlety in the tantrumlevel messaging in this show the capitalists arent just corrupt or selfish in this show notheyre so evil that they literally plot the end of the world in order to make money they effectively plot the deaths of their own families though the show doesnt seem to realize it the amount of space and the inclusion of any extended family would be precluded these folks were plotting the deaths of their own parents cousins siblings and friends they are so evil that even hitler himself wouldnt match up hitler after all loved his mommathis level of cartoonishly evil villainry makes the entire plot hard to take at all seriously but waitthats not even the funny part ultimately the society they create in the vaultsseems to be relatively classless and moneyless its a socialist commune so this band of archfiend capitalists created a socialist paradise one wonders if the writers of this show even proofread their own scriptultimately a major twist that literally everyone will see coming turns a villain into the unsung heroine the infamous moldaver it turns out is trying to make cold fusion available to the world its an odd choice since cold fusion is a scam and a con in the real world whats worse it seems like they already have real fusion in compact easily portable cells the world already has infinite cheap power what is she really providing it was baffling to me why anyone needed to pursue cold fusion in this worldso look if you can ignore the comically bad messaging fallout isnt terrible its not greator good even its okay but its really hard to not roll your eyes at the messaging because this show slaps you in the face with extremely unsubtle messaging in almost every episode after the first one its honestly a little hard to watch unless youre a dedicated fan of the video game series and youre here for your nostalgiaheroin if thats what you wantyeah i think this show delivers the rating on this thing though is being driven by that not the real quality of the program which was pretty meh for those wanting it to stand on its own
having completed fallout  new vegas and fallout  i initially expected to dislike this series but i found myself bingewatching it through the nightthe fallout games are renowned for their postapocalyptic and atompunk rpg elements featuring a vast exploratory scale eccentric factions gratuitous violence and offbeat humorthis series encapsulates all those aspects while managing to strike a balance by infusing a grounded dramatic tone that intertwines the excesses within a westernstyle narrative structure typical of modern series it seamlessly integrates the main quest with character development glimpses into the prenuclear world and compelling sequences set within the vaultcontrary to my initial concerns the series avoids being overly absurd showcasing wellthoughtout design elements the dialogue feels authentic the storyline albeit eccentric aligns with the universes essence and the actors deliver performances that lend credibility to the narrativewalton goggins shines as ghoul kyle maclachlan impresses with his portrayal and the entire cast delivers commendable performances the chemistry between lucy and maximus is particularly noteworthyit seems like bethesdas todd howard has reason to celebrate as this series is poised for success and may even boost sales of the original fallout games following the success of the last of us this adaptation further solidifies tv as a platform to expand upon vast gaming worldsi am optimistic about the continuation of this trend and wholeheartedly recommend this series to fans of the genre and anyone who appreciates scifi and fantasy subgenres fallout the series earns a solid  out of  in my rating
ive played my fair share of fallout games but not enough to be an expert in them i mainly play them for the enjoyment of an apocalyptic style gamethe way this show incorporates not only parts of the game but also the feeling of the game was outstanding i loved all the twists and turns and head scratching scenarios it portrayed the story telling was super easy to follow and pretty engaging i never found myself wandering off and getting bored i loved the diversity in the scenes as well theres plenty of apocalyptic war scenes as to be expended but theres plenty of funny and engaging scenes to dissectall in all this was an amazing cross between a show and the game coming to real life so excited for season  hoping it comes with a bang
"by far the best work of primeim very critical in how i invest my time and never write reviews but sometimes its so worth it that you take some extra time for itfirst they created and even improved the vibe of the gameexcellent episodes storytelling casting filming cgi
good feel about the pace of the episodes not  bad episode in it it was constant evolving creating depth improving to the story it is just a must watch for everyone who loves the game but not necessary a must that you need to have played it or everyone who enjoys a real masterpiece of a seriecant wait for season this is the reason people switch from netflix disney  to primetook some balls of steel to take this on and theyve done it excellentcongrats to everyone involved with the show"
this is how video games should be translated onto the movie screen great stories lots of great likeable charactersstanding out are ella punell and walton coggins that are excellent in their respective partsi thinks its only aaron clifton moten as maximus that lets the side down in my opinion hes just miserable boring and an odd choice for the character not sure why he was cast with such a vast array of actors available  fallout gives you exactly the same post apocalyptic wasteland vibe that you get from the game which is exactly what i was hoping for and is a favourite of mine i cant wait for season 👍
whether you are a fan of the games or know nothing about them fallout does an amazing job satisfying both types of viewersthe creators of the series made the brilliant decision to create a new story in the fallout universe that can coexist with all the games director writer and producer jonathan nolan made it clear that he didnt want to drastically change any of the established lore but instead contribute to it and he accomplishes that goal remarkablywe follow  main characters on their journeys across the remnants of southern california in a retrofuturistic nuclear fallout the switching of perspectives from across a  year period of time is done often but the transitions are seamless and warranted all the characters connect with each other in ways that feel natural some of the story arcs are deceivingly complex while others are mysterious in nature which will have you wanting to start a new episode as soon the current one youre on endseven the side stories involving supporting characters were compelling and led to some of the best moment in the entire seasonthe action humor and drama in the series is evenly placedprime video spared no expense when it came to the costume design graphics and post apocalyptic alternate history settingfallout proves you can tell an original story without changing the core of the material to attract new viewership in sticking with this idea prime video set a new standard for future video game adaptions to follow
i very rarely write a review for a show ill usually just like it and move on this show is probably one of the best adaptations to a game universe that i have ever seen its an original story set in the world of the beloved game universe so you dont need to play any of the games to enjoy it but you are rewarded with so many wonderful homages if you have playedthe little details go a long way but the story itself is just beautifully done it embellishes the fallout universe with these strong characters great arcs and fun dialogue throughout the whole seasonanyone trying to make an adaptation of a video game should look to this show or tlou as a blueprint they take everything you love and just elevate it and make it special i cant wait to see what else they include in season  and where the story goes do yourself a favor and watch this
ive never played a fallout game but i liked all of the little gadgets and scifi elements showcased in the show i like the power armor the ghouls the bottle cap currency the vaults popboys and et cetera i also enjoyed the characters and every performance was stellar i also appreciated the interesting casting choices seeing moises arias play such a big part of the show was funhowever a lot of the plotting is extremely convenient and clunky despite having to walk everywhere characters will just run into each other by complete happenstance this made the wasteland feel really small as characters could travel great distances with looking at all tiredthe discussion of the themes was also extremely shallow and done a million times before weve seen the big company bad story a million times and this show doesnt really add much new mr robot and the boys are shows that have a much better critique of large conglomerates and capitalismthe filmmaking behind the show wasnt amazing the wasteland always looked really fake and the fight scenes were passable at best any scene in the vault looked amazing but once you get outside the vault everything looked like a setthe finale also lacked any sense of great pay off as all the characters already knew each other and there wasnt a great sense of buildup to the climaxi didnt regret my time watching fallout it was a fun show to pass the time with and ill watch season  but it didnt blow my mind like it did for some other people
the fallout tv series does a fantastic job expanding on the beloved video game keeping true to its essence while introducing fresh elements the creators have managed to add new layers to the story without losing the core that fans lovecharacter development is a standout especially the main characters evolution as she faces new challenges while holding onto her core beliefs another intriguing subplot features a character who undergoes a significant transformation after taking a new medicinethe series balances an adventurous tone with a mix of humor and darker moments one of the most memorable scenes is the reveal of the skeletons from the main characters fathers past adding a surprising and emotional depthoverall fallout is an engaging and wellcrafted series that will captivate both longtime fans of the game and newcomers its an adventure worth watching from start to finish
this latest in a recent trend of videogame adaptations is lacking the edge and wit of the fallout titlesbethesdas famous ip could work on the small screen but the how is something i feel is still as of yet unanswered porting a videogame to a tv show takes work because those are two very different mediums with different aims splitting the story between three characters isnt necessarily a bad idea got did brilliantly on multiple subplots but it can be hard to properly pull off the sprightly ella purnell as the vaultdweller female protagonist lucy maclean has a face that fits the brand and a geniality and greenness to match but is just missing somethingthe throughline and recycled brand is shaky and i feel the show is unsure of its desired identity at the moment original fallout is hilariously unhinged comical with dark humour that simply flows between scenarios  across the different factions it challenges notions of conventional ethics and philosophies too so theres always food for thought but the challenge for the writers here is to find a story that can work cohesively on tv that feels like fallout but takes it in the new direction of a plotdriven live action productionthe dialogue in the games is outstanding and engaging but here its merely okay every word should entertain develop or expand but i cant say that here it really does we get a lot of camera panning into facial expressions and filler speech but not enough meat and potatoesthe story lacks suitable structure it feels too sandbox without enough linearity and purposeful direction wheres the show going what does the viewer have to look forward to where are the cliffhangers on many occasions the show is absorbed in the scene of the moment and forgets about introducing the next chapter the fluidity is missing where are the characters driving motivations are the characters investable or just expendable the producers perhaps assume that the strength of the fallout brand can compensate for mediocre writing it doesnt
ive been seeing a lot of reviews saying that fans of the game wouldnt like it but others would and i have to completely disagreei am not very familiar with the game but thought id give it a go however the acting is so stereotypically bad that i cant figure out if its on purpose or not i dont connect to any of them theyre stiff and robotic and somehow overacting and under acting at the same timeone of the characters is off to find her dad but i cant say i care theres just no connection between the viewer and the characters its very  dimensionalnot sure if it gets better as the season progresses but i fell asleep watching episode  which is surprising since i never fall asleep watching tv and took it as a sign to save myself from the rest of the season
fallout the highly anticipated television adaptation of the beloved video game franchise landed on amazon prime in april  set in a postnuclear los angeles the series follows a new generation of vault dwellers venturing out into the irradiated wasteland heres a breakdown of its strengths and weaknessesthe series captures the desolate beauty of the fallout universe perfectly the ruined los angeles skyline the dusty settlements and the irradiated creatures are all brought to life with impressive cgi and set design fallouts signature dark humor translates well to the screen the witty dialogue and quirky characters provide muchneeded levity amidst the grim backdrop ella purnell shines as the resourceful vault dweller while aaron moten brings gravitas to her conflicted companion the supporting cast including a charmingly ruthless walton goggins adds layers of intrigue the series doesnt shy away from exploring the consequences of war corporate greed and societal collapse it offers a nuanced look at the struggle to rebuild in a broken worldthe initial episodes are slowburn which might frustrate viewers looking for immediate action the narrative picks up later in the season but some might find it loses momentum towards the finale while the series establishes the core themes of the fallout universe it doesnt delve as deeply into the lore as fans might expect some iconic locations and factions are missing leaving some wanting morethe special effects as mentioned earlier are topnotch the creature design is particularly impressive bringing the mutated horrors of the wasteland to life in all their grotesque glory the score effectively complements the atmosphere with a blend of haunting melodies and suspenseful orchestrationsthe entire cast delivers strong performances purnell embodies the determination and resilience of her character while moten brings depth to the morally ambiguous companion walton goggins steals the show in his charismatic yet menacing portrayal of the ghoulfallout is a solid debut season that captures the essence of the franchise while the pacing and worldbuilding could be improved the series boasts stunning visuals compelling characters and thoughtprovoking themes fans of the games will find a lot to enjoy and newcomers might be drawn into this unique postapocalyptic worldits worth checking out but be prepared for a slow burn with a strong payoff in the later episodes
as what i can assume is the average fallout fan who enjoys being critical but fair of showsmovies watching with a friend who barely knows fallout we thoroughly enjoyed every episode almost in one sittingi do enjoy being critical of media sometimes but every time i felt a small frown across my face it was only after many minutes of awe fear or joy which quickly resumed afterward on occasion do some characters act in a way that allows the scene to play out or have plot armour of course they do its a show where a story plays out but that story was very good and the actions takenoccuring never stood out to me as being ruinous or destructive of my viewing experiencethe visual creations and changes from the base games mostly fallout  of course were all great i loved the armour the power armour there were only  scenes out of the whole first season please season  please that i thought it looked like cosplay foam the scenery was great even if most of it was dry ruins and cities it made the world feel like pockets of people and chaos aurrpunded by inhospitable waste which its supposed to be the underhand holding of the in my opinion kind of ugly fallout  assault rifle made it feel bulkier and like a big menace which made it really cool the new design of the mm pistol is my favojrite so far keeping some of the intended bulkiness but making it more sleek seriously though why does it have a revolving part it holds like  rounds whats spinning and why but all of this even if it sounds bad it small criticism in an overall amazing world i will forever rant about small things but this show was a blast and i can laugh along with it not at it it was amazing with the inevitable tiny drawbacks that did not disuade my  rating
im probably in the minority of viewers that have never played the computer game franchise so i come to this freshhugely enjoyable and superb production cast crewyetit feels familiardark and mysterious stranger with backstory to match young innocents discovering the world overcoming lethal problems deceptively easily everything building to staged showdownit bears more than a passing resemblance to that other giant of dystopian tv from a few years back westworld maybe its the sandy west perhaps its the cowboy in black maybe its the acting stylethis is not a criticism yet it feels too close to be a genuine gem saying that ill still eagerly google when series  is airing filling the time by rewatching westworld
i havent played fallout but im fairly familiar with the lore and my brother is a huge fan so ive absorbed some of it to me fallout feels like a special franchise with a lot of cool ideas i went into fallout expecting the worst given that its a s era adaptation and a streaming show this time on amazon primeim happy to say this thing really won me over it took an episode or two but man i left this first season of fallout feeling like this was quite possibly the best video game adaptation ever made it actually makes me optimistic for the future of adaptation if more movies and shows could do what fallout did i dont think audiences would be as miffed but im getting ahead of myselffallout is so good that it almost seems effortless not only is the world building absolutely excellent with the show drip feeding information at a perfect pace but it looks awesome too multiple times while watching this i jokingly said this place would be perfect for the amazonworld theme park thats inevitably in the works thats how good so many of these sets werethe show is excellently paced it doesnt feel like its dragging its feet and while its fairly obvious what the final episode will entail fallout manages to keep things fresh and exciting going in directions i didnt expect theres about four major storylines and they all intersect from time to time in a logical and fun way that i felt was a masterclass in storytellingit also nailed its tone and never wavered from it even when it got more intense and dramatic towards the end its overall a very funny show that doesnt take itself too seriously but when it does it really hits i think it deftly manages comedy horror drama and suspense really really well and kept me engaged the entire timethe characters are also great here buoyed by some really great performances walter goggins as the ghoul is undoubtedly the show stopper of the season he manages to be intimidating but not comically and a cold brutal man who still want to see succeed i love how by the end of the season hes not changed all that much but the context about him has and that makes you the audience see him in a new lightella purnell is also fantastic as lucy id only seen her in zach snyders army of the dead in a truly hilarious role so i didnt have high expectations but shes such a perfect and effective protagonist with her naivety leading to some of the shows best moments she grows a lot through the course of the show yet similar to the ghoul still retains what makes her the character we came to love i also really liked aaron moten as maximus he has a nervous energy that i felt worked very well he can be competent and capable but not so much so where it feels alienating he really is the closest to a normal person we meet the entire show which might not be the highest praise but i was always rooting for himthere are just so many great choices in this series i love how each of the three protagonists represents something about humanity motens maximus the well meaning everyman who like most of us will do bad things if it means survival the ghoul represents humanity lost and the result when pure selfinterest and cynicism take over and lucy idealism and civility tested of course but still there at the end of the daythen theres the litany of fantastic side characters and bit roles the amazing s aesthetic and music the compelling mystery and oh i didnt even mention moises arias and his excellent arc and character norm after the first episode i kinda hoped that was the last wed seen of the vaults but man they were some of the best stuff from this season the whole mini story in vault  was phenomenal its was a masterclass in foreshadowing and exploring theme whilst giving us some hilarious moments and great relationship building for lucy and maximusas for complaints i do think some of the cg is a bit shody i didnt love how the knights of the brothers of steel looked and there some moments of rubbery ugly cg that took me out of the show i didnt love maximuss storyline by itself but i found it left a lot of room for more in the futureyeah watch this thing just watch it its excellent it won me over and it makes me want to play the games what higher praise for a video game adaptation is there
considering all the terrible producers in   who regularly crush the dreams of star trek star wars and fans of other established intellectual properties very refreshing to see an ip with tons of merit getting produced by individuals who understand their jobfallout is a legendary video game franchise fallout  and fallout new vegas are to me top  all time video games fallout three was like gta iii  it changed the industry gamers were provided interactive bliss for a game that one could sink  hours into which is remarkable for a single player experience fallout and fallout  were more turn based strategy games but established a ton of lore items and ideas that were carried forward into fallout   a third person action game but a third person action game with role playing game and strategy game elements also incorporated into design gamers were given a ton of customization for building their character both aesthetically and how they applied perk abilities while leveling the beauty of fallout  is how the player could really tailor a characters ability to exactly what they want this included physical abilities improved use of tools and weapons intelligence abilities like hacking and charisma abilities for better communication and deception on a single play through not all abilities could be had  so the player had to pick and choose abilities to round out their characterthats all a lot  but the bottom line is there are great games in the fallout franchise and a ton of merit from which to draw from for the record i would say the same thing about the monster hunter franchise and the mh movie was a god awful train wreck that is where intelligent production comes in you need producers who understand what it takes to make good television but also who understand the source ip and know how to draw merit out of that ip in the modern era it seems like many producers think that they can just take an existing ip and do whatever the heck they want with it change fundamentals insert outside content that has nothing to do with original ip and worst yet  use the existing ip to float their own messaging and insipid ideasnot in fallout in fallout the producers hired the right people and let them work i wonder if they ever had to define parameters or if the producers were able to simply get out of the way and let their chosen talent do their jobs however it unfolded the end result is a borderline masterpiecefallout the tv show is about a future world that never grew out of the s style and aesthetic the mix of retro aesthetic science fiction future and post apocalyptic wasteland makes for a great playground to inject characters and narrative which is exactly what happens while fallout does have a single main character there are basically three main characters each with their own story arc these arcs intersect which unfolds across  aaa episodes a second season has already been authorizedwhile the show unfolds in an easily digested manner  the story is quite complex as is the backstory for each character while im sure many have attempted a summery i just recommend watching the show one episode will probably be enough to fully commit but if there is any doubt definitely watch at least three complete episodes kinda like an anime before deciding what the show is fallout has a lot of highly stylized violence often with humor involved the effects and really all technical qualities are top notch this is one of the better seasons of tv all genres in the last  years its up there with the best of got early seasonsif you cant tell i loved this first season of fallout it also gets me going on my ax grind  producers who selfishly attempt to ruin existing intellectual properties for dubious reasons but i know its not as simple as understanding and loving a video game to make it into good tv producers also have to understand their own medium and how to pick and choose merit from the other genre to make something goodbut this is great such a rare gem and  gamers know that bethesda the company behind fallout has been struggling for the last  years with their video game releases their last great game was fallout  but even it fell short of fallout  and nv in my opinion fallout  came out over  years ago that is a long time with no great releases it is my hope that the fallout tv show reaches a mass media audience and provides the influx of resources and interest that bethesda needs to make more great video games in the future even if that doesnt happen if this show is done right for multiple seasons  it could be the greatest thing to come from that publisher and that to me is an astonishing possibility
first of all the acting in this show is absolutely unbelievable ive always been a big fan of walter goggins in more than one show and he absolutely is great in this one ella pernell doesnt absolutely amazing role her attitude and performance is amazing i will admit that i only played the video game briefly but i cant wait to download the game again and play it it is wonderful to see a really great story brought to life in such vivid detail cant wait for the next seasoni would describe the season as a little bit of a slow burn they are developing the key characters this tells me that there is a long ark to the story i wish that it was  years in the future and i could watch all the episodes at once
this show actually thinks its viewers are a bunch of unintelligent feral ghouls which i am starting to think is the case based on the number of high ratings every single element of the show is in some way made with the thought how should the audience feel about this moment  and of course this is not an issue in itself  however they are taking the absolute shortest path in this regard every damn time something happens that should be terrifying according to the producers terrifying music playing the ghoul guy acts cool high pitched ominous yodelling playing this is an irk that will stay with me forever and some people might think this is stupid and yeah in many cases music is good at carrying an emotion through since it is an audiovisual medium we are talking about but when listening to the soundtrack with some thought it becomes apparent what is happening the music is changing at least once every thirty seconds to accommodate whatever is happening and it gets tiring real fastnext on the list the godawful innocenthumour that the vault woman is doing in every encounter yeah it was not funny the first timeclosely related the onedimensionality of characters the show is basically just a bunch of exposition with nothing really happening everything is either one same dry joke something cool happening stupid action scene with a minigun shooting a guy at point blank and not hitting once  seriously wtf was that or supposedlysad but not actually since no actual attachment is being formed with the characters because who would get attached to somebody as emotionally thin as butter on your bread
i started off really not liking this show the first two episodes are a mighty let down with a lot of bad writing and plot conveniences characters just know things she has been locked in a bunker all her life but she knows what a raider is that she would just run into the man she needs to to find the raider that took her father twice which led me to my biggest complaint there is no adventure in this adventure story nothing has any real significance they are just places there is no destination for most of the series its just a vague direction that eventually comes together because the season needs to come to an end nothing is earned nobody has any significance and its just a stop on a trip to nowhere but then episode three starts and the series makes a complete  the lack of any real focus is still there but now we are blessed with the story of the series best character the ghoulcooper howard is a great character with an interesting backstory commanding presence and a well needed kick in the shows pants and he works well paired with lucy maclean hardening her and preparing her for the dangers of the wasteland and this carries over when she later leaves him for maximus helping her cover for the weakest of the three main characters maximus is just awful a sniveling jerk at worst and a overgrown child at best and we also have another surprisingly interesting plot arises norm maclean who i thought was going to be a weasel character easily written off steps up in his investigation behind the vaults new overseer for four episodes this series really had me investedand then it tried to wrap up the stories to an underwhelming conclusion the overseers secret should have been a bigger impact but was undercut by the revelations in the ghouls story revelations that were a massive overstretch namely that corporations have any nukes let alone enough to initiate nuclear armageddon and that they still have nukes to destroy the socialist utopia of a woman who somehow aged thirty years in the last for four episodes i thought the show was really interesting and for four episodes i was sorely disappointed i liked the look of the locations but never once were any of them memorable to the plot i liked three of the four main characters and wanted to see where they ended up but was left underwhelmed in the end i liked the throwbacks the the games but the new content doesnt live up to them as much every step forward also felt like a step back
when this first dropped a trailer i was initially angry at the fact it was set on the west coast where three of the games take place   nvas more went on i started to tolerate it but ultimately waited to watch this to formulate my opinionbefore i summarize each episode from my point of view the props scenery and costumes are done to perfection everything made me feel like i was watching the games i love come to lifeanyways onto my opinonepisode  was an absolutely masterpiece it portraits vault life down to the last detail even what life is like within a bos military camp it sets the protagonists goal their motive and their opportunity excellently not to mention the scene at the start which is so tense if you know whats going to happen when it does it take everything away with a bang pun intentionalepisode  picks it up nicely introducing us to the series most loved canine companion dogmeat and also giving us a brief look at the enclave the scenery and atmosphere drives people into what the post war world was like and lucys vain vision of trying to rebuild america gets shut down by every settler above groundepisode  vault life is pure evil a dystopia nuclear family vision instilled into these dwellers shows on full display props to norm for being smart it also introduces us to one of the many mutated creatures some salamander which i believe should have been some geckos or deathclaws to better suit its environmentepisode  feral ghouls and my handys are done exceptionally well when lucy emerges from the super duper mart its a perfect time for her to break into the wasteland life its common for us all to do it in the games on our first run we try our best to be nice but ultimately end up death machines but lucy doesnt this episode was the first one where my hope for the series being faithful starts to waverepisode  i started to get angry at this point because of two things one is lucys vain hope for a nuclear life which she tries over and over but it just keeps getting shut down at every turn the other now my real nit picking arose at the sight of shady sands being destroyed gamers knew from   and nv that shady sands is the heart of the ncr and that its the main support line for the troops in the mojave fighting the legion in  four years after it was meant to be nuked todd howard addressed this by saying nv was canon and considered for this series but how can you say that when something like this happenedepisode  vault  is cool its experiment was clear and all the lore was there for us to experience yes the cult gathering where everyone stripped naked to honour shady sands and their raider god i also love any time it takes us back to pre war america except episode  the story is so gripping and actually made me plead for a whole episode pre war maybe during operation anchorageepisode  ncr riot gear on full display the only time we see it at all the only presence bar the flag and then nothing maximus shutting down the vault just for power armour was nice a voodoo wizard turning someone into a ghoul via a serum now hold up the ghoulification process is one that requires a high dose of radiation like with the ghoul and plenty of characters in the main games so an injection can do it now the love story is horrid as well a cheap cop out to entice plot armourepisode  now this this was my ultimate hatred coming out lets start before the great war and its all in one scene vault tec talking with robco general atomic repconn and the big mt it all seemed a cheap shot to really drill home that vault tec was pure evil but we didnt need that no gamer every got told that vault tec were evil nor that they dropped the bombs we had to find that information with no aid from bethesda or obsidian i believe they only had this conference to have the old phrase war never changes which could have been done in so many better ways maximus now back in filly which has become a bos camp somehow manages to be spared and then is told by the elder that they can rebuild the brotherhood never would a bos elder conspire with a squire to rebuild it they would have exiled him on the spot for poor performance in the field not like it matters as maximus gets a promotion to knight at the end so that whole piece could have just been made differentlucy upon reaching the la observatory the last bastion of the ncr in the boneyard the la area in fallout  and the correct name for this area meets moldaver and this piece is so good the acting is excellent that she explains to her with no persuasion nor word of a lie that hank is the one to nuke shady sands the delivery is amazing but the fact an overseer of v has access to nuclear armaments just takes the biscuit at what point could vault tec had predicted that their overseers would want to nuke cities out of pure spite and revenge oh lets not forget that they teased season  by a shot of new vegas this means there is now a canon timeline for the second battle of hoover dam and this puts the bar incredibly high from the gaming community that bethesda do this correctlyultimately i wish it had been done somewhere else like chicago atlanta or even the state of texas by doing it in california they limit themselves because of the expectations that have already been set in the games
"ive played fallout  nv and  and i was very impressed by how faithful the show was to the gamesthe look of the vaults the weapons the environment etcbut the main aim of the whole show seemed to me was to say to gamers  hey look at this just like the games arent we clever without fleshing out the plot enoughalso i found some of the actors a bit underwhelming or miscast one in particularon the other side i thought moises arias was great in his rolethe last episode though with the reveal was quite good and did bump up my ratingcouple of other detractions
one cgi monster was not convincingit was not explained how one character managed to survive from prior to the bombs to the shows timeline but maybe i missed the explanationdont get me wrong i enjoyed the series and will watch the next season the show was certainly better than the majority of other game to show productions ive seen"
what had to be expected from bethesda as a long time fan of  and  i was already well aware bethesda never understood fallout fallout isnt about some s retro future that world got nuked and is gone all that remains of that time are uncanny relics of the past bethesda fallout looks and feels like the bombs fell  years ago and were bearly making a comeback not  years lateralso the ghouls are zombies thing is a hill bethesda is apparently willing to die oncostumes and settings look quite nice the female lead is convincing turning the whole message to capitalism bad is laughable coming from amazon also way too light hearted has vibes of suicide squad but without being funny also retcons a lot of fallout  and new vegas mediocre show at best
this was everything i was hoping for and more with the only exception being the lack of the ever present mutants that were prominent in the video games i might have my releases confused so if they didnt exist in the releases the series is based on apologies the mutants presented a consistent and ever present danger as one of the strongest and most feared villains in the game additionally they always had significant loot and imaginative and deadly weaponry in their hives im hoping to see them introduced in future episodes i realize the makeup and special effects budget would skyrocket with their introduction but now that we see that the series will succeed please bring them on
i actually came in expecting this show to be bad honestly most the trailers i saw looked cringe and poorly put together thankfully those trailers captured a few lesser moments but it didnt hurt the overally quality of the showyes lucy can be a bit annoying at times but after a few episodes her character continued to develop and she settled into the role we also follow maximus the ghoul and norm i was interested in each of the side stories that tied everything togetherthis is a great and rare example of how a show doesnt have to perfectly follow the games but can still be very good when you strike a good balance between characters lore and storytelling while still tapping into the things that made it special in the first place something the recent halo show failed miserably atthey also earn extra points by including dogs as an integral part of the story after all it was the thought of dogs being left out of the vaults that pushed cooperthe ghoul over the edge and into discovering what valtec was really aboutthis is a really fun gory dark but enjoyable ride looking forward to the next season for sure
i havent played fallout so i cant compare to the game but this was immensely enjoyable as an adapted video game it felt like a perfect balance between a standalone series and gameplay there were times that i could really feel the video game vibe in the exploration of a new space or on a mission to retrieve an object but it was so well integrated that it enhanced the viewing experience rather than detracting from itthe humor was unexpectedly good and i loved the juxtaposition of the midcentury modern aesthetic and music with the dystopian landscape and technology they combined to give a sort of zany modernized steampunk feel similar to legion but less seriouswalton goggins was exceptional as always he really elevated his role and ella purnell was a delight i thought the maximus storyline was rather weak but i dont know if that was from the acting or writing the only other quibble was the lack of true peril i never really felt like our heroes were ever truly in jeopardyvery much looking forward to more
i wasnt keeping an eye on this at all i love fallout but when i heard it was getting an adaptation from everyones favorite evil corporation i wasnt really filled with confidence on top of that fallout  was more middling than id hoped and  was so fallout was sort of in a weird place for me all this to say that i only really only had a passing interestwell i was wrong this show absolutely nailed it it blew my expectations out of the water and shot up to being possibly my favorite video game adaptation ever a shining example just like the last of us series of what this kind of story can do the screentime and overall stories of each of the protagonists is balanced and written so well and they all end up being characters i want to see more ofquite possibly one of the most impressive things is how much the show really feels like it is the plot of a fallout game in a good way you can see the different character builds the main questline the sidequest the factions the gear and set design and there is a dog everything is crafted with real appreciation for the source material and as a bonus tells a completely new story instead of adapting an existing plotthe only real thing i think it was missing was more unique creatures and locales im looking forward to seeing where this show goes from here
"first of all i am an fallout game fan ive played fallout  fallout new vegas and fallout so i would dare to call myself a long time fanbecause of the history of adaptations i was holding back on watching this until i watched the first episode and was like wauw and then watched the second and again wauw and so on and so on and finally done what a great show i would have given this a  out of  if it wasnt for the character maximuswhat a bad character what is his qualities why is he bad at everything why is he a douche what is with his facial expressions i could go on show would be almost perfect without himat the end of the season i hoped so much he would die maybe even sacrifice himself i dont know boy was a disappointed when he livedbut if i look at the whole show this is amazing the sets the feel the characters the reference to one of my favorite games well done 👏
i am very pleased i cant wait for the next seasoni just hope they kill maximus next season 😅"
this show was the absolute pinnacle of entertainment when it comes to portraying the beloved game series in the form of entertainment i loved every second of it and believe that despite the harsh ratings there is some form of excess criticism from other fansthere are to a degree some plot holespieces of lore that are restructured in the show this however does create a future dynamic that can be molded upon and tied into with the games i am extremely excited to see how this functions with the upcoming aaa titlein addition to this i am certain that even for first time enjoyers of the series the series creates an undeniably captivating storyline and sets up for an amazing second seasonwhile i am not spoiling the show this is sure to be a continued success provided the same quality  craftsmanship that went into the first season carries into the next
looks great is sometimes funny stays true to the source material but feels incredibly shallow and drawn out if the season had  episodes i might have been able to overlook that nothings really happened to the story after the seventh episode but this seasons just a prologueunlike with arcane or lou the two better game adaptations ive seen the focus here is on the look and on fan service for the gamers not on a compelling storythe world is also impossible to understand for those who havent played the games whats a ghoul how do you become one whys that person alive why isnt that one how does the tech work how long has it been since yeah you get it a million questions most of us whove played the games can answer but struggle explaining to those next to us stepping into the world for the first timehoping for a more story driven season 
i was definitely not convinced at the beginning even hated episode one but sticked with it although i couldnt watch more than  episode a day found the mood very overpowering however by the last episodes i was hooked and when everything came together i realized its a great show the story is awesome the filming and aesthetics is excellently done now i have never heard of the game because im not into that but the series i found just great cant help it but be excited about season  to discover how this story unravels i recommend it slow in the beginning but turns out awesome by the end objectively speaking an excellent show
i watched every episode and found them all to be entertaining yet average on most levelswith the delightful exception of the ghoul there is no way all these  and  reviews are anything but hypebaitthroughout the  episodes i constantly had the feeling that something just wasnt quite working on various levelsalmost like the production had been rushedthe series is not terrible by any means just not as good as id hoped maybe my expectations were just too high but two things are for certain some of the acting is not up to par and some casting is just plain wrongwatch the series and im sure youll realize these weaknesses early on just as i did there were a few other things that bothered me but thinking maybe it was just me so i wont mention themthere is a bit of gory content but what else would you expect when ghouls are involvedi do recommend the fallout series because all in all it is entertaining and worth the watchjust had so much potential to be even better
i want to start by saying i never played the video game series but my brother has i have been watching with him and getting his input it does incorporate the theme and details with some characters from the game which is great that it is not like the halo series as they did whatever they wanted to do without following the classic storyhowever i quit watching after  episodes because i cannot find a good grounded character that is not extremely strange and relatable lucy is the closest to a relatable character with hope but she is so arrogant and obtuse i understand this is a postapocalyptic series but i love the last of us which followed characters in a crappy situation as well the protagonists in fallout are just bad people making you question rooting and hoping they will change for the greater good also so many plot holes i dont mean to be nitpicky but for example why the heck would they not check for radiation before the wedding why would the robot give lucy a finger to then harvest her organs and the raiders running away after max crushes one of their heads while not in the suit there are so many more i dont understand and they have no reasoning behind itanother problem is why is everything so sexual i did not have a problem with lucy saying she had incest with her cousins because that could be unfortunately somewhat understandable in their situation but why would you need to show a guy masturbating in the boot camp that would not change the story or scene at all also the pregnant woman in the vault with the cousin dressing as her husband literally no need for these scenes its uncomfortable and only pleases some weird fans fantasy of incestthe ghoul was the only good character written in the show in my opinion i was really disappointed especially from all the hype i am sorry if this offended any diehards of the series i thought i would put this out there however
the crossover from ps to tv is an all time high having enjoyed movies resident evil  super mario bros mortal kombat was okwe now have a new tv series spin off from the classic game and having played it the similarities and the terrain after the fallout from the s atomic bomb is just brilliantthe goul played by walton goggins was gold and totally stole the show the cast were brilliant and loved the brotherhood of steel suits were just epicplot had a few twists which was good and seeing the surface  years later was great with giant bugs and a bear you would rather walk away from love the exploding parts from gouls impressive shotgun remind me not to cross his pathhoping for a season  to expand the story in to the wastelands no spoilers
fallout does a great job capturing the unique tone that makes the games so great an apocalyptic future suspended in time that time being s america its an ironic take on the eisenhower period that takes the nuclear family a little too literallyits entertaining to watch the contrast between humour and violence that resembles the coen brothers best work whereby the humour is genuinely funny and the violence has real stakesi was initially skeptical about this series as a big fan of the games it seemed like opportunistic studios just trying to capitalize on the video game to tv success of the last of us but its clear that between the big budget production attention to detail and solid artistic choices writing acting and camera work all are exceptional this is a passion project for jonathon nolan brother of christopher nolan and i think theyve done a great jobwhether youre a fan of scifi western comedy actionadventure or just big world building entertainment this show has a bit of everything
overall a quick run down is that the show is great they follow the lore canon culture and feel of the fallout universe well while connecting the necessary dots in between the stories of the gameepisode  they show the prewar world through the eyes of the ghoul back when he was human with his daughter he was a western star at the birthday party the nukes start to drop and he escapes with his daughter via horseback we meet our three protagonists lucy of vault  maximus of the brotherhood and a sentient cowboy simply known as the ghoul we learn their varying backstories lucy maclean is an optimistic but naive vault dweller and daughter of the overseer hank she is married off to another vault dweller from a different vault as a trade but they dont realize it was raiders led by a woman named lee moldaver it is hinted she has a secret past with hank but that isnt established until episode  moldaver kidnaps hanks which makes lucy leave the vault maximum is working as a brotherhood grunt cleaning up crap talking to his friend dane before the prydwen a giant flying airship arrives as they need squires assistants to help the knights soldiers with power armor for those that dont know the bos is the brotherhood of steel a military dedicated to protecting the people of the waste and harboring dangerous technology so others cant have itmaximum and dane talk recruitment and dane ends up getting recruited but somebody sabotages dane by putting a razor in his boot so they couldnt go the perpetrator of this act would be revealed in episode  so maximum replaces dane as squire for a knight named titusminor characters slim hancho and biggie go to a base in mexico to free the ghoul for a man named don pedro they end up in a conflict where the ghoul kills all three and ends the episodethis episode has  kills between biggie hancho slim the vault dwellers and the raiders using various firearms and melee weapons junk jet and even a barrel of pickles i found references to grognak corvega mister handy pro snap camera and the junk jet weapon in this episodein episode  we meet an enclave scientist named wilzig and his dog companion he met in his lab called cx later referred to as dogmeat the enclave are evil scientists and they just unlocked a powerful device that has the ability to restore power to long dead grids of land he injects this is his own head steals the dog and escapes the enclave this is why don pedro freed the ghoul and also the reason the brotherhood of steel is after wilzig lucy eventually meets the scientist as she wakes up and he tells her to return home seemingly knowing of her family the vault and more she carries on regardless meanwhile knight titus and squire maximus are flying in a vertibird modified military helicopter to a town called filly not philadelphiawilzig eventually stumbles upon a cave hearing a roar he decides to leave maximus and titus stumble across the same cave and maximum eventually kills what turns out to be

using his military history the ghoul exposes the weakness of the armor causing maximum to fly off uncontrollably lucy and wilzig escape with a cybernetic leg for wilzig made by ma june he takes a cyanide pill as he isnt going to make it and reveals he was headed to moldaver and tells lucy to chop off his head and offer her the treasure inside for her father she agrees and after he dies she chops off his head the dog was shot in the midst of the fight but the ghoul stimpaks him so hell track him to wilzigthis episode had roughly  kills mostly to the ghoul using three different kinds of firearms but also one suicide one bear attack bleed out and my favorite was the guy who got the bullet to the neck that the ghoul talks to there was references to cram stimpaks bobbleheadsthe ripper railway rifle assaultrons turrets and super mutantsepisode  we learn the ghouls name is cooper howard or coop for short who was a hollywood western star lucy with wilzigs head sets off for moldaver with coop and dogmeat tracking behind maximum fakes his own death to the bos and pretends to be knight titus they send him a new squire which turns out to be his old bully thaddeus thaddeus not realizing its maximum as the armor disguises his voice and covers his features continues his ruse pretending to be knight titus this allows maximum to reciprocate the bullying he gotback at the vault

ive read a lot of comments saying this is one of the best video game adaptations of all time i dont know about that as ive never played the game but what i do know is that its one of the best post apocalyptic series ever madeits basically split into  stories which interconnectthere is lucy played by ella purnell who lives in a community under the earth in one of  vaults no one has ventured outside since the world became a radioactive wasteland but circumstances will dictate that lucy will go outside in a quest to find her fatherthen there is maximus played by aaron moten a servant assigned to look after a knight called titus knights are men who wear powerful suits of armour and are highly regarded and respected maximus has a dream of becoming one and that dream is eventually realisedthen last but by no means least theres the ghoul a mutant cowboy with a droll delivery and no nose this character is destined to become iconic and walton goggins who plays him is faultless hes funny scary and ruthless in equal measure but has a great backstory which humanises himthe creation of the devastated world and creatures that inhabit it are beautifully rendered it is visually stunning but the visuals are backed up by an excellent script and brilliant direction the pace is just about perfect the intertwining of the stories is expertly donethis is hugely entertaining and leaves you wanting more
apparently the budget was generous i loved the stage designs costumes and visual creation of the world i think the creators of the series have the right hearts and i am convinced that they care about the world in the games become familiar with it and bring it to the screen i also felt like the actors absorbed the charactersthe most likely criticism that i guess people will bring to the series especially from fans of the first two games and new vegas is that the series is made too comedic the seriousness is reduced and the serious concepts in the source material are lacking i strongly disagree fallout was always a bit of a postapocalyptic world parody the intensity of this increased in the third game in the th game this became the dominant atmosphere in the story as someone who hasnt played  the series continues from where the th game left off the brand so it didnt bother me at all moreover i find it quite shallow those who believe that a work becomes valuable only with serious topics and philosophical depth
first things first as always there will be no spoilers in this reviewfallout as the title from a singular word suggests is about the end of the world a theme not estranged in the entertainment industry on the contrary it is one of the most handled topics rarely well done often rushed and unimaginative and while most forms of entertainment focus on the actual happening itself fallout focuses on well the falloutthe general timestamp of fallout is around  years after the cataclysmic events the show intrinsically weaves current and flashbackstyled historic storytelling the latter of which excellently constructs the base for the former without giving away too much about the plot obviously the show does it graciously albeit with a hefty smear of gruesome details and since prime had one of its best successes with the boys which doesnt shy away from gore spectacles either its no surprise they gave the good ol ok for this paththe show is produced by many but jonathan nolan is the main set piece for its production he also directed the first  episodes himself after which he gives the esteemed job to many other gifted directors clearly able to see each directors vision in each separate episode following number  its nolans vision for the show that upholds high quality tv theres a jungle out there of adaptations of different forms of entertainment turned into other forms of entertainment surprisingly enough however we do not possess a lot of adaptations of video games surprising because there is a vast pool of excellently told epic stories in the land of gaming and we get the witcher ouchthe mix of a producer andor director with his or her own vision on the product seems a match made in heaven as most adaptations choose a linear approach to the story told from its source of entertainment that match works wonders for fallout and the result is a strong contender for one of the best tv shows to hit our wailing screens in while production and directing are important in the fulfillment of an epic tv show the cast is what we are confronted with as viewers as a more direct face of the show and here as pessimistic as one might be about adaptations especially if youve consumed the base version first the show comes truly comes to life grounded strong and naive lucy played by a stellar ella purnell is the shows most centric character with its main storyline seemingly deriving from therebut fallout tells a much bigger story than that it tells the story of the naive that come to surface the story of ghouls that lived longer than they should have the story of communities and collections not necessarily supporting lucy in her story but rather constructing and building further upon the main arch its walter goggins and moises arias that further improve a stunningly strong cast these are the main storylines mind you and there is so much grandness to be witnessed by just the smallest of characters layer after layer is peeled off even the smallest characters with the littlest screen time can have a rippling effect on the story told and thats when you know youre watching something different entertainment that wants to achieve something only few canconclusively the story of fallout is twice for the most part its about survival after literal lifeending events for the smallest but perhaps most important part its about the ancient discussion of what can be considered good and bad in this new world which will instantly be trickled down to the most profound desire of mankind to persuade willingly or unwillingly others to your ideologies and beliefs a story told such as that with a good amount of selfmocking and imaginative violence by a cast and production team that clearly lays its heart into its art is entertainment in its purest and quite frankly best mannerso we ask with nolan at the helm can we finally have a good adaptation off of a video game yes yes we canrated  out of  bottle caps
we finished this series last night and i found it to be a grind  it was nice to look at  mostly entertaining with great set designs but the majority of the writing and acting was bad imo  bgrade qualitythe tone and pacing could be all over the place at timeslucy and maximus irritated me the most with pooraverage acting cooper was the most enjoyable but still far from the best acting work from gogginsit was the prime postapocalyptic equivalent of disneys star wars which was trash at its core but they tried to make it aesthetically pleasing and throw in enough references for the fansive played a few fallout games not extensively but enough and saw that they captured some of it wellworth a look if you want something simple and entertaining but people are overrating this
as the title says i had no idea this was a computer game although the title rung a bell i think im maybe too old to play these computer games  over  but the series is worth a watch if you can allow leeway on some of the concepts  the bloodthe does seem a lot of blood  how did we cope in the s without it  in all those bond movies etc  this is an aspect of a lots of shows  films that i think needs looking at its not real and making it look real doesnt make the story any better im not a prude by any means but where does this lead us in the long term just producers pushing the boundary further and the viewers getting less sensitised to gross events this makes real violence more likely or if not the violence that would happen anyway more twistedanyway that my input on that fallout is enjoyable and ill be watching the full series
theres an awful lot to like here both for hardcore fans of the games and new or casual viewersthe visuals are absolutely spot on with sets costumes props and many many easter eggs all being taken directly from the games right from the start where s p e c i a l and skills are directly and cleverly referenced the colour palette is more varied and the lighting is brighter but this is a plus point had it been shot in grimy muted tones it would have been jarring and antiimmersivewith a score either taken from or influenced by the games theres nothing to complain about there eitherthe alternativehistory of  is equally well realised and convincing although since its filmed with the same palette as  the flashback transitions arent instantly obviouscommendably the showrunners dont shy away from the gore and gibs of the games with some scenes verging on body horror these are counterpoised with comic relief and character drama again consistent with the source most of the writing and dialog is solid with some standout scenes it takes a brave writer and director to have two main characters talk over each other with competing narratives but it works here there are a lot of characters and plotlines to juggle and interweave but credit to the writers they knit them together in the finalethe core cast is strong with ella purnell in particular being wonderfully winning and convincing as the innocentabroad vault dwellerhowever there are significant flaws which have to be addressedfinn  i mean maximus  is played competently by aaron moten but hes far too old for the role ella purnell is also  or  years beyond her part but plays the ingénue more credibly helped by those startling eyesthe treatment of ghouls is wildly inconsistent the writers cant make up their minds from one episode or even one scene to the next whether theyre nearindestructible superhumans or not and this does matter because it would matter ingamesadly the overarching plot for the season is a mystery box reveal which  as an original idea of currentyear hollywood scriptwriters aimed squarely at their own peers and the modern audience that they are convinced exists  is as infuriatingly farcical and ideologically driven as youd imagine it retcons an entirely new fallout lore driven purely by virtue signalling from the most hypocritically enthusiastic beneficiaries of the very thing that the writers profess to eschewtragically the final few scenes are simply an extended to be continued question mark montage theres no conclusion here just a tease that might be fulfilled in  or  years given the hectoring that was just delivered and the lack of any firm premise about what future seasons might entail beyond more retconning flashbacks this is a weak and insipid way to conclude what was shaping up to be a solid season the writers simply ran out of ideas and punted the ball
this series had a good plot but it would have been so much better if it werent for lucy and max i swear to god they are the most idiotic characters to ever exist firstly i understand that max doesnt know anything since he grew up in the brotherhood but come on man have some common sense even after everything he does to get the brotherhood to praise and respect him it just makes him look like he has one singular brain cell lucy was a little bit better but all those dramatic pauses were just unnecessary it shouldnt take her that long to make a decision when she has  brain cells in the time these two characters pause and just stare at nothingness while they are in danger i could get a college degree find a husband get married have children raise them retire and die in conclusion they are irritating and i will forever be their  hater on the other hand the ghoul and the dog seemed like the only actual normal characters if i were him i would have shot them both as soon as they tried to reason while in the middle of the shooting but ig he has more selfcontrol okeydokey thats all peace out peeps
"there was no inspiration to somehow write reviews of moviesseries having quality reviews of musical works and anime behind on imdb and because of that i could not close profile checklistbut i loved this series so much that i decided to write to my friend a review quickly literally in two minutes review of it for him to start watching it right now and of why its worth to watching and why this series is actually well madewell when lyrical digression is done for this review of questions  answers thats what i called it lets get down to it

i liked this show a lot as a fallout fan for years and years to start off with what i did not like is that for someone who maybe has not played the game and only watched the show is going to get a bad taste of sexism in the show the show starting showing females being in power and taking charge while if the man wasnt a bad guy then he was a coward but i think once the episodes keep going along you see that they live in a damn vault so its expected i loved it but didnt like how quirky and or how naive lucy was i thought the character would be more like katniss everdeen just chill not loopy doopy not taking hints
hi there i really enjoyed it what i like best is that the characters are funny and extravagant but they also have depth for example how most of the vault dwellers live in ignorance and comfort underneath the surface of the radioactive surface in one scene one of the characters who is from the surface is taken down into a vault for the first time it does not take long before he parted ways with the other protagonist sidekick and hes isolated in his own room feet up with a massive bowl of popcorn and watching a silly retro tv he sees his friend being forcefully manhandled outside the window and he is conflicted he knows he should act as he looks longingly at the popcorn and he does decide to act and as hes psyching himself he has one last big mouthful of popcorn lol its such a great momentanother one of my favourite scenes is when the ghoul is using the female protagonist as bait so he tied her up and lowered her into the water where she obviously could not breathe and so began to drown this is obviously torture but he goes on an exposition about these studies they used to do before the fallout i wont be able to describe it here but it was one of my favourite scenes from the whole thing it makes me laugh remembering how chilled this guy is talking about oldfashioned studies while hes got this woman tied up and in mortal dangertheres much more to it as well i highly recommend it and cannot wait for the next series which will probably come toward the back end of 
i dont know what to say there are parts about this show that really nailed it and i mean they nailed it and there are parts that dont i can easily overlook many of the little things as the big ones definitively overshadow it but its missing one key thing fallout did not hooked me inive played all the fallout games long before it was made popular on the consoles i did not play the new one that failed mind you overall fallout is probably my most favorite game franchise ever made so why does it feel like it came short somewherei think its because in the games you do have to use your imagination in cinema your kinda expected to show it now i dont think the dark side of fallout needs to be shown like the saw movies cause that would put a lot of people off the games were limited to cartoon graphics and cartoon puns it was a perfect combination fallout the tv show is trying to blend  different story telling mediums and somehow falls a little short in thati dont think im making a good point here its just something i feel put another way ill probably one watch this once but it does not have rewatch interest for me but hey maybe my expectations are too high and i just got to let it play out more its just the start lets see where season  goes and maybe i will have to change my mind about season 
never heard of the fallout video game in my life not much of a gamer but i love waltons work and have been following his cereer so i decided to give this a go with having no expectations or preconceived notions about what this should be like or what stpryline this whould fallow this show is absolutely the best piece of tv entertainment ive seen in my life i mean acting was excellent by almost everyone photograpy cgieverything was amazing some of the reviewrs comment on editing or directing i have no such evaluation skills but lemme telll you this show is well worth your timebinge it
i havent been able to find a good show in a long time until now and it is now my favorite show im already binge watching it all over again its that good just like the game and it makes you want to play the game all over again when youre done watching the series its a must watch and the actors are phenomenal all three main character stories makes you glued to the tv its full of fantasy action romance comedy and horror this show seems like its going to be big and im all up for it my whole family is now addicted to you dont have to play the game in order to watch the series
my favorite part of the entire series was the opening sequence that shows the bombs dropping and even that i had some issues with like nukes dont explode slowly enough for people to have time to say oh no honey thats just smoke from a fire watch the trinity test footage im all for dramatic effect but make it realistic that being said the scene was intense and beautifully acted by goggins and i got goosebumps sadly the rest of the series didnt have the same effectthe fallout series took a tone shift with the arrival of fallout  prior to that yes humor and absurdity were present but they were sprinkled in amongst the backdrop of a desolate dying world with cruelty and horror around every corner in fallout  often the first person you encounter is a homeless guy begging for a sip of clean water hes not goofy weird or absurd in any way hes just a normal human there are slavers that keep kids in cages with bomb collars around their neck thats the kind of world were in the show however feels like its turned that formula on its head it feels more like humor and absurdity are now the primary focus with sprinklings of reminders that oh dont forget were in a post apocolyptic wasteland and fallout  which the show seems to be most emulating seemed to be the beginning of that tone shift where the colors were a little brighter the characters a little wackier the sense of dread a little less present the show has taken this to the next level with brotherhood knights that act like delinquent teenagers organ harvesting drug dealers that watch tv all day and act like stoners and a goofy brain in a roomba being the mastermind behind a vault conspiracy i wanted more scenes and characters like norm moldaver charlie whiteknife and barbara who took their circumstances very seriously and whose perfomances sucked me into the worldthen theres the issue of certain elements of the show feeling hollow and not given the weight or depth they deserve like the scene where all the big corporations are meeting with vault tec it seemed way too easy for a meeting like that to have been spied on barbara even noticed her pipboy was transmitting but decided to still attend that meeting with it on come on then she just casually says in the meeting by dropping the bomb ourselves admitting to all these ceos present that vault tec is considering creating the nuclear holocaust themselves info like that youd barely share with people inside the company let alone blurting it out point blank to other companies unless you know theyre fully on board and all these ceos present were ok with the end of the world the end of their empires in exchange for a few vaults where they could run human experiments maybe they were but they didnt give any indication as to why and vault tec said this would be an opportunity to end conflict by outliving all enemies and having a single monopoly how when youre giving away vaults to other companies with their own ideas on how to run things how does that result in a single monopoly and not just another bunch of factions bickering and warring over the right way to do things it feels like theres so much missing here so much that has been glossed over and just thrown together without attention to detail or nuance this is the kind of meeting that youd find in a climactic scene of a show like  or homeland where multiple government agencies have expended mind boggling amounts of time and resources to get a recording of that we as the viewer have been slowly piecing together over the course of the season but in fallout this incredibly precious info feels unearned and like its just being lazily told to us for a plot point the idea that vault tec started the war is something that people have been speculating since the inception of the fallout series and it didnt feel like the grand revelation it deserved to beanother culprit of this was the scene where lucy learns about her father i didnt buy the fathers performance trying to stop moldaver from revealing the truth and lucy seemed to accept this reality way too easily youre gonna believe that your father who you love nuked a town cause some lady who killed your friends and family told you so again just lacked depth and nuance and left me wantingmy hope for season  is that we get more depth and nuance and the creators lean more into the gritty nature of the earlier fallout entries and lose some of the oh darn i missed every shot cause i suck without a scope on goofiness
i was sceptical at first thinking it was the band wagon after  the last of us and then halo perhaps it is yet this was s anyway engaging from the start a different take on many apocalyptic stories but a good cast who played their roles extremely well it was great to see kyle agent cooper maclachlan demonstrate how underrated an actor he is also the strange and bit scary guy from lost played his part impeccablyyes its a video game story yes its a bit daft but the music script a pretty good acting made this enjoyable i hope season  lives up to the promise this season did
someone whos not played the games but was aware of the lore and visuals of fallout i was pleasantly surprised to be taken on an almost instantaneous bizzaro joyride through an apocalyptic americana great performances running throughout with a nearly unmatched fast pace that leaves you no time to pause something i find lacking in so much tv of today walton goggins is as usual excellent a layered and confident performance the set dressing locations and costume work are all superb worn out destroyed and strikingly impressive worth a watch for anyone who enjoyed the high energy and violence of s scifi great fun
if you are a gamer  played fallout  or  the nostalgic elements will draw you in immediately most of the elements in the game has been used to come up with this storyline even the naivete of the vault dwellersthe violence level is on par with the games or possibly morethey could have introduced more factions instead of only the brotherhood of steel and brought out more dystopian outlook by showing many factions warring with one another to get hold of the techadditionally they could have gone with a male protagonist instead keeping in line with the original fallout series tradition the actress playing the protagonist is not good with her acting you dont really relate with her struggle onscreen rather you wonder why she is so dumb and codependentmale protagonist would have suited the fallout story much better
i really really wish i could have given this a  the actors are great for the most part and the decorations and setting mostly hit the right spot but everything else falls very flatfrom the perspective of a longtime fallout fan this cant count as a good adaptation of the west coast not when all the lore has been retconned to hell and back la had a giant successful city angels boneyard not anymore shady sands is now there though wait no it isnt it is now nuked why by who is this the end of the ncr the lack of ncr presence seems to indicate so why though why are the survivors squatting in griffith observatory when there are ncr cities all around where is new reno san francisco the hub presumably they are the same place as the angels boneyard gone from the lore to make place for a dumb fun mad max settingthe same retconning goes for the factions west coast brotherhood was on its last legs nope they now have metal airships and a gigantic base as well as enough military might to conquer the nearby shantytown for no reason dont get me started on the enclave they should have all been wiped out long ago with ncr persecution of former members but no they are now scientifically advanced have a big facility somewhere and an unlimited power source which they had zero ways of getting since it belonged to vault tec who also kept the activation codes for it how did they manage to get the newest mcguffin but not the codes no idea maybe thats on me i dont know if i accidentally skipped a scene where thats explained please let me knowbut even if you arent a huge lore nerd like me the inconsistencies and plot holes will still drive you nuts i already mentioned the whole enclave fiasco but this is not the only thing that is simply introduced for no reason and not explained anywhere except maybe maybe in a potential season  why is moldaver alive after  years it is strongly implied that lucys mother was the first to leave the vault otherwise shady sands would have been nuked way earlier so cryo is out so is ghoulification no reason for her to still look almost exactly the same when she should be a skeleton by now what about the invincibility serum thaddeus gets cause it sure as hell didnt make him a ghoul as maximus said ghouls cant take an arrow to the neck why does a random guy have that why was he in danger earlier if he has the vaccine to all injury so many questions so few answersthe smaller inconsistencies are a little less in your face but they are still noticeable power armor can now crush skulls bring down buildings and throw bricks at near bullet speed but only when it is not inconvenient to the plot when titus is fighting the yao guai when maximus is fighting the ghoul when the brotherhood assaults the ncr remnants it barely gives an edge except for titus there it was more of an impediment why did snipsnip sew a finger onto lucy if she was going to be harvested for organs anyway how did vault  find maximus power armor when he left it far beyond the bridge why did the ghoul shoot the enclave scientists leg off if he wanted to get a live bounty why give him a life threatening injury that makes it way harder to move him if he wanted him dead why aim for the leg how did enclave guy ever get out of the base how the hell does maximus not know there are people in the vaults when everyone on the surface seems to know and for some reason hate the vault dwellers such inconsistencies are small and some can be hand waved away but after the first couple of times it becomes increasingly harder to suspend ones disbelief and let this slide this is lazy writing plain and simpleonce again i truly wish i could give this a higher number as i had very high hopes from all the good reviews and my friends recommendations which were unfortunately not realized i loved lucy and though i often did not understand what they were doing with maximus he had his moments norm was also solid id say the vault story was the most engaging though it is a tad bit spoiled by the knowledge of vault experiments most fallout players have which causes them to never doubt that there is something shifty in  and  i give this show a  one for lucys character surviving the writing thanks in no small part to the actress and for norm and two for decorations and sets please improve in nd season dont mess up new vegas
i love the fallout game series but with bethesdas handling of it and their recent disaster being starfield i didnt expect this to be good obviously they didnt make the series but being the ip holder and ones who have influenced the new stories which id say have been lacklustre their involvement at all gave a bad smell to this series accompanied by really corny hollywood marketing i expected this to be a mainline show directed at normies and not actual fans of the games im happy to say thats not the casewhile fallout has some corny parts and typical hollywood moments its never offensive enough to deter the writing doesnt take itself as seriously as cyberpunk edgerunners or arcane being my two favourite game adaptations but fallout has always had its goofy side being a satirical narrative about postwar politics so it didnt really hurt my viewing experience as it may have done with othersif youre a fan of the games i can say that it is directly appealing to the newer generation of games from fallout  and onwards and even new vegas for the ones who lean out of the bethesda camp fallout  had some references but the first two games really take a back seat and more so exist as a benchmark of story accuracy and making sure the timelines are good ive yet to see any references or tieins to those games while aesthetically it pulls from fallout  and it also shares a number of the same locations from fallout  towards the end we see some tiein to fallout new vegas which gets me excitedstory wise we follow multiple characters that all have converging narratives the story isnt anything particularly amazing feeling more like a bunch of side stories tied together in a way it feels akin to a game story which im all for the details flesh out the world and the lore a bit more and in a way that i personally likethe main selling point is the set design with characters clothes power armour locations all looking high quality every episode is such a treat visually and it makes you want to go back and play the games just to experience the world of fallout again this inofitself makes the show worth watching when the music kicks in and the vibe is just right it makes me smile and that in itself is enough for me to recommend the showfallout is the best live action game adaptation ive seen and im so glad that it didnt fall into the same trappings as the witcher did
this game came out before the last of us and that game is just a more brutal adaptation of this game both series as a result are quite good after watching both i can honestly say that i prefer this version its dark humour its dystopian i love it the choice of music is excellent and adds to the dystopian feel of the show i cant wait to see what they do with the second series in the show the ending certainly opens up a bunch of possibilitiesthis show is really about a version of edgar allan poes the story of dr tar and professor feather or as they say in the show what happens when the ranchers have more power than the sheriff in the end we still dont find out really we just see that they are just two sides of the same coin
never played the games but being a gamer for  plus years you gotta be living u der a rock to know the lore or fallout always a game i wanted to play but never the time to play it this series is by far one of if not the best gaming adaptations yet the characters are absolutely amazing and walton goggins ghoul character is my absolute favourite from what ive seen via walkthroughs and reviews ive read on the games it seems to follow them with plenty of easter eggs and thats coming from someone who never played the games i can only imagine that hardcore fans will find many more hidden easter eggs than myself id say the series is on par with the last of us and halo although halo is a mixed bag for many hardcore fans due to master chief removing his helmet maybe better by a small margin bur we shall see where season  takes us but im pretty sure new vegas is the setting for that cant waitif your a gamerwatch it if your not fear not its still an amazing show and you really dont need to know anything from the games as the important details are all explained as it goes
as someone who has been a fan of the fallout games for many years now this series is something very special it does a very good job capturing and bringing to life the franchise to a live action format watching this made me go redownload new vegas and  lol  highly recommend the showthe only thing that i would like to maybe see in season  is to potentially see some characters or areas that are unique to specific fallout games it could be a blast to see some of that brought to life to satisfy even more of that itch for some nostalgia from the various games we enjoyed before we were gifted the show
if youre not a fan youre in for a treat but for fans it hits home on different levelsim a massive fallout fan been one through all the games starting with fallout  and working my way back ive had dozens of playthroughs of the games by now and probably going to get going with another one sooni distinctly remember the anticipation for fallout  after a long wait the wait for the series has been similar after the success of witcher i felt fallout with its extensive lore could be great and was really holding out hopeep  felt right and familiar ep  felt like being transported into a typical fallout game plot line its the little things they do throughout you can see the care and love that went into thisthen the end leaning in to decadelong fan theories was just the cherry on the cakethis was absolute pure nostalgic indulgence and i cant wait for more i just want some muties worth super sledges and a deathclaw or twoif youre not a fan youre in for a treat but for fans it hits home on different levels
i have to say that i have no idea about the storyline of any games that there are i started watching fallout mainly because of the good reviews that it has and it did not disappoint having in known that many of tv shows movies made after video games are in a lot of cases pretty bad this one really blew my mind it has to be one of the best tv show i have watched in some time to be honest and i do watch a lot of em quite surprised by the story having in known that i did not know it and the interpretation of it because it couldve been a disaster but they handled it really well i might actually play the games after this one haha
show was really good had a great mix of original content and elements from the actual lore the comedy was great and not forced the only thing thats keeping this from a  is a really outstanding character arc i didnt really get attached to any one character though all of them were greatexcept michael rappaport screw that guy besides the characters the music choice and setting were amazing looked exactly like something youd see from playing new vegas or  they even chose music that wasnt ever in the games but fit the show perfectly which was really good overall the show is a great intro series and i hope it leads to many more seasons
while the tv series has received a lot of  reviews i would encourage you to take those with a grain of salt the show is decent but its not necessarily the groundbreaking mustwatch experience that some commenters make it out to beas expected the series does include representation for the raibow community with a girls who uses madeup pronouns however i was disappointed to see the inclusion of a person of short stature and other minority characters that felt more like boxchecking than genuine welldeveloped representationoverall the tv series is worth watching if youre interested in the premise and have the time but if youre looking for a truly exceptional viewing experience you might be better off playing the original game that inspired the show it seems to capture the essence of the source material more effectivelyd
although im not the one playing i love supporting my husband by watching and helping him as he plays i keep an eye on the surroundings and alert him to any loot or incoming enemies after hundreds of hours ive even built my own collections in every settlement he constructseven an island teeming with gorillas watching this show brings that same thrill and enjoyment the storyline humor atmosphere scenery and the junk gun are all purely delightful i appreciate that they embraced the adult humor instead of watering it down for a broader audience its also exciting to see how the show expands the lore and raises new questions im eagerly anticipating what unfolds in season two
but my rating is about the tv series its beautiful wellproduced and serviceably acted by a strong cast but ultimately for me the television show is only as strong as the dialogue and its actionthe dialogue in the show is weak and the action doesnt really put us or the characters in difficult situations where they have to make tough choicesthe overarching quest narrative is kind of weak but the characters have kept me interested i just wish they said more interesting articulate  and significant thingsim willing to see where this show goes but it is not as many reviews say the best adaptation of a video game so far
fallout as a game has always had amazing lore and game design and being the person i tend to just naturally check reviews before watching a show to see consistent  stars and  rotten tomatoes is this a joke perhaps a collective prank just like morbius i honestly dont knowspoilers from episode  and  belowthe acting is awful but not just awful but the script these actors have to read from dont even help quite literally the worse dialogue ive had to listen too i understand the concept that vault dwellers are naive but there is being naive and then being quite literally stupid with the huge lack of any survival instinct to the point where maybe the little genetic diversity due to them being all cousins has canonically made them all cognitively impaired lucys ignorance is unbearable giving her only water bottle to a complete stranger on the surface who looks like he would rob her for everything this is way past her being simply naive shes just an idiot the dialogue between her and the ghoul was so cringeworthy i was ready to turn off the show right then as i realised that maybe lucys stupidity may not be satiricalgoing back to episode  when the raiders were killing the people of vault  with the exception of a few  vault dwellers putting in some effort to stopping them majority did absolutely nothing not only was there no sense of urgency and lack of security i mean as they were all fighting two people were still carrying food on a tray casually oblivious to the shooting of guns and the screaming something that was heard even from lucy all the way in her room with the door lockedmaximushonestly its like the show wants me to hate these characters how can someone with even little screen time be so annoying the scene between him and the cult leader during his interrogation was once again a hard watch hes not even interesting  hes not likeable hes probably cried more than hes spoken and hes a terrible knight talking about the knights the guys in the power armour they are obviously shown to be these intimidatingstrong and trusted fighters for the brother of steel yet when one of them comes in contact with a mutated bear resorted to the act dead approach and had to rely on his squire with just a pistol to take it down for him pay in mind this is the same knight who was saying i just what to shoot something right now and dropping off the helicopter early just to be a complete embarrassment whats more stupid is that as maximus was going to stim him so he didnt die the knight in the power amour saw this as an opportunity to absolute incinerate maximus for no reason despite maximus being the one to decide his survival and the one who saved him in the first place i thought these guys underwent vigorous training and even some education yet the chosen knights all share a singular brain cell apparentlythis show is awful the acting is awful dialogue is awful i really dont care about lucy or maximus to be honest they are both equally unlikeable and i really dont understand how the reviews on this show are high considering the terribly nonengaging plot and awful creation of d charactersdont watch it its not worth your time
i dont write many reviews but when i do its either something really good or something really garbage that im amazed how it was madefallout is so good that im actually going to re watch it again this weekthe scene where lucy uses a stimpack and it makes that hissing sound i pauses the show stood up and started clapping for a minutethen it was a joy ride from start to finish i enjoyed everything in the show the characters the visuals the power armor the creaturesstandout actors are walton goggins ella pumell moises arias and dave registeras for aaron clifton i didnt like his character at the beginning but then understood it and its dry comedy and hes a favourite now as wellplease watch this show and lets get a second season
wouldnt even know its a videogame adaptation good setting culturally relevant good acting noncliched these guys actually have a hit on their hands i really hope this gets a season  and hopefully we retain the writers and nobody ruins it walton goggins what an og man this guy never fails to make the room more interesting no matter how big the set is the two kids playing the other mains solid story romance and acting the way maximus plays wounded but struggling to continue is absolutely terrific his facial expressions are top class same with the vault dweller chick playing the naive but pure hearted chick guys just fall in love with well played continue season  dont screw it up ty
well done jonathan nolan and team zero noteswhether youre a fan of the games or not this is a great show that stands on its own two feet its fun actionpacked funny a little philosophical theres mystery charming characters and a fully realised world lifted straight from the games particularly fallout    and adapted successfully for the small screenthe world of video game adaptions is a murky one with many horrendous insulting laughably awful movies and shows based on masterful pieces of fiction that seem to everyone who takes the time to play them boxed and ready to go to be adapted into something great they never are recently the last of us felt pretty close to greatness but everything it is was lifted straight from the game it was based on almost word for word almost shot for shotthis show is its own thing completely its a brand new story and it manages to recapture the magic and essence of the fallout video game franchise and fit into its canon this is the first great video game adaption which is wonderful for all video game fans after the slurry weve been forced to eat again and again but most of all and what im really happy about is its a great tv show full stop
everyone who has ever played any of the games and liked them has their own take on what a show like this should be like i think as a hardcore fallout fan myself i had such high expectations of my own that i was certain that my the bar was set too high but  just wowlike so many have said the props the detail the sometimes illogical quest lines the quirky dialogue and most of all that illusive fallout feeling that the game gives you that i thought would be impossible to recreate its all there and then some so damned pleased with this and the cocky mr goggins is excellent as hancock sorry cooper 😅 even dogmeat makes an appearancethe scene in ep  where lucy holds up the flag and inon zurs excellent fallout  theme plays is one of the biggest goosebump moments of my life loli want more more more
i dont kbow much about fallout when it came out havent played any fallout game before and unknown what this movie about but after  episode i had to download and spent every day to played this gameso if you havent played any fallout versions like me dont be worrythere is something extremely attractive about this film from the frames characters to the music and the plot are all at  for who played game before you should enjoy the movie and dont take it seriously because its just a beginning of fallout seriesthe movieve done great job while illustrates apocalypse word vaulttec wasteland fractionsto compare between movie vs game version lets call the its liveaction version with brilliant new storyline from jonathan nolan it described pretty accurate to the game we shouldnt put in much expectations while its just a frist season sohope to see season 
phonedin the amazon studios adaptation of fallout has major plot holes is riddled with inconsistencies and it totally fails in capturing the feeling of the source material the dialogue is totally phonedin the acting is phonedin animations are phonedin the story suffers from a major lack of substance with a ten hour running time the moral of the story can be summarized to the banal intro to phil trolley problemthe preexisting universe should have made the job relatively easy for the showrunners instead they make huge blunders that totally defeat the purpose of the original story and what it was trying to achieve the worst aspect of the show even more awful than rendering the story meaningless are the absolutely horrid attempts at humor and acting the showrunners repeatedly try to use the original humor of fallout as a crutch for introducing all sorts of awful lines jokes and socially incompetent behavior all    yo act like teenagers hey bud dont question it its because it is a postapocalyptic worldwherever you look in phonedin whether it be the story or the experience you wont be left disappointed if you come knowing it is phonedin
this and one piece stand as case studies of how to make a proper adaptation  one that both satisfies fans and makes a good standalone series for newcomers as someone with little previous exposure to the source material i found this highly enjoyable in its own right the sets and visuals are incredibly well produced not a single actor was unconvincing andthat being said it did fall victim to the common pitfalls of such ambitious projects the show tries to be gory and harrowing in much the same way as game of thrones but in a very season  manner main characters are invincible to any setbacks injuries and threats to their life with an irritating amount of deus ex machina being conveniently saved at the last minute not to mention that overplayed timing issue in which a character is saved because their attacker is conveniently slow to hurt them if a main character does get injured it has absolutely no consequence and is usually rectified within the next couple scenes they also must have lacked sufficient broll because they replayed one characters exact same flashback about  or  times without it even serving much purposewhile the show manages to pull off most of its goals it attempts to establish itself as gritty and unforgiving yet contradicts itself in each of its plots for the vast majority of viewers though these types of oversights are par for the course in modern entertainment and likely wouldnt hinder the experience
"one of the best video game adaptions to date with a top of the line performance from ella purnell hard to believes shes been in two of the best adaptions so far i absolutely loved her in arcane
and she killed it with both roles great humor very fallout like and also dare i say perfect performance from both supporting leads walton goggins the ghoul who had a tragic story to his character but still comes out on top as the most badass in the wasteland and aaron clifton lucy new brotherhood boyfriend they bring so much life to this show im very excited for season  war war never changes"
really good except for the last episode the motivation for the corporate types to do what they did is just not realistic its silly even the writers let themselves down with that episode theres no way a group of corporate leaders would intentionally nuke the world so they can do social experiments in a bunker it doesnt make any sense at all its amazing that this was the best idea they could think ofgood up to that point interesting enough to consideracting was good and the main characters likable with good character development throughoutsome nudity in the show that was entirely unnecessary
i know about fallout as ive picked up on it through cultural exposure but never directlythis show makes me feel like i should at least play new vegas because while the visuals and execution are decenttogood it does a poor job at making me care about anything thats going on from charmless actors with boring and unlikeable characters horrible pacing and plenty of empty drawnout moments to dull writing dialogues and interactions no particular element grabbed my attention and i felt finishing this show was a chore i had to get throughim saddened at the delivery of what seemed like a promising new show to watch but it reminds me a lot of all the problems i had with the later westworld seasons where nothing was particularly interesting
this show surprised methe first episode or two had me thinking why bother this is stupidridiculous no i havent played the game but kept into it and by the thirdfourth episode it had me curious if not hooked this is likely the difference between our older generations comic book oriented upbringing versus computer game storytelling 🤣yes there are obvious problems with the science fictionfact details but nothing serious that totally kills the story it was compelling enough to finish out all  episodes the whole premise is ridiculous but it is presented in an entertaining way so as far as popcorn scifi which is not a compliment its good enoughwe do need another season of fallout as long as the writing keeps up
as an avid nerd of the fallout games i was naturally extremely skeptical of this series going into the first episodei must say i was very pleasantly surprised they manage to combine the uniquely bleak feel of the fallout universe with a reasonably coherent storyline and great charactersadd on top a healthy mix of mordibly dark humour and lots of senseless violence and you got yourself a great watch for any fallout fannot sure how it would hold up for people who havent played the games given the majority the backstory to the fallout universe is explained in the games themselves and probably seem silly without context
the attention to details spread throughout from the game are greatly appreciated the story was good but for a fan of the game seeing this world come to life was the real win the world of fallout is quirky and weird and the show captured that this is meant to be true to that not an adaptation to anything plausible beyond the world created in the games for me thats a winmemorable characters and tons of cameos tell you how beloved the franchise is lots of known actors are happy to play bit roles just to be a part of this project its not for everyone im sure but if you liked the games and you want to see it come to life youll enjoy this i know i did
walking in i was sceptical having been really only into the fallout universe since fallout  i wasnt a purist the budget and effects whilst not perfect are certainly not janky enough to detract from the visual spectacle the characters are unique and flawed there so far seems to me an absence of the message and its a good  fun watch is it a mind blowing experience no is it a fun hour watching some post apocalyptic mayhem yes certainly there is no absence of gore and a plethora of nostalgia for me that wasnt enough not to like and it is probably one of the best game to screen adaptations so far for me above the last of us
its like the games and the spirit would have come to a tv show also its a great production story and actingits fascinating how they managed to merge the brutality conspiracy and humor of the game without making it stupid once started its hard to stopi wonder how amazon came up with this and how they managed it to make it a great show without utilizing any political agendahope they will produce more of fallout content and further connect the dots between the games stories missions and characters maybe also showing a way into a prosperous scenario of the worldthanks for bringing that show
its a show based off the fallout video game series of a dystopian future where a chosen few fled underground during the s in order to survive the nuclear holocaust for the survival of human civilizationits kind of a fun idea where even though its scifi and based in the future the people all still act like theyre in the s the characters have a vibe sort of like the movie once upon a time in hollywood so that idea alone is already so clever that its easy to escape from reality to tune into this series the trend right now for any show or movie is to have a female lead cast and i think they found the perfect one with ella purnell who plays lucy maclean who is the daughter of the overseer of vault  when her father is kidnapped a young brave and naive lucy feels obligated to venture out of their protective vault and into the unknown nuclear bomb ravaged surface in order to rescue her father so that vault  can continue to be as its always been peaceful and pleasant the success of the show is anchored by lucys curiosity about everything that she comes across in the outside world as were introduced to new characters and places she comes across while lucy showcases her true beauty inside and out in her unwavering moral compass in her need to always do the right thing its the ultimate fight of good vs evil as the kind hearted main characters of the show deal mostly with corrupted souls who have been conditioned that way by the crooked world where they had to adapt that way in order to survive lots of comedy and violence sprinkled in throughouti give this one a  and a must watch for anyone who says the perfect female lead doesnt exist
as a long time fan of the original fallout  and  as well as new vegas i was a bit hesitant to how this should would be written as the narrative of the bethesda adaptations never lived up to the heritage of the original interplay games or the obsidianblack isle new vegas game with their amazing narratives  which in my opinion fallout  and  never reachedi was happily surprised as i avoided any trailers and hype before i saw the first episode the intro music from fallout had me smiling and there was enough fan service to keep me smilingi saw the entire series with my wife who did not play the original games but she did play new vegas although she wasnt a fan the same as me she did however enjoy the series once we got a few episodes into it of course i gave her a live commentary to the lore of the fallout universe and i cant say for sure how someone who with no additional information about the background story would enjoy this series but hopefully that extra depth will just add to the enjoyment and if you are curious there are a lot of videos on youtube to give you a summary of the previous  yearsi know there was some controversy about how some lore was potentially ignored from new vegas im not sure it holds but even if it does i feel like it doesnt take much away from the enjoyment of this series for meit still has the dark humor the gore the cynical world where there really arent any good guys and that is what makes this world so special i think this was a really good adaption the female lead is not the boring strong female character that has no faults and therefore no character arc she develops in every episode and so do the other characters you get more backstory and by the end i was very excited for morei think there was a good balance here to introduce the major traits of this world for new fans as well as old and now i care enough that i am also worried because i havent cared for a series since season  of game of throne endedi hope they keep honoring the lore and spirit in which the fallout universe was created this is a great show in a time where such are few and far between and unlike most things produced by hollywood lately there was very little message and preaching the story delivered and that is what should always matter most i hope more studios learn from this
while there is certainly a lot to praise in this rendition of the fallout universe i still cant really call myself a fan of this showbeginning with the praise this show was beautiful to look at the cinematography was strong the costumes were great the production design was absolutely fantastic and the visual effects were well done basically every technical aspect of the show was very well done and often times exceptionally sothe makeup for the ghouls was excellent the designs for the creatures and world were stylish and interesting and the action sequences were well choreographed and well executedbeyond the technicals the shows cartoonish tone and sense of humor was sometimes very effective there were a few times that it made me chuckle no doubt and i was genuinely impressed with the setup of the story the initial scene that established the nuclear fallout was excellent and lucys introduction was very well done you get a real sense of who she is almost immediately and are drawn into her perspective effortlesslypart of that is the lead actress talent in fact nearly every member of the cast performed their roles quite well with a few notable exceptionsand overall despite my criticisms which ill get into there were definitely moments in the story that were entertaining and engaging i was curious about the mysteries the show introduced and was interested enough to follow it to the conclusionbut thats all the praise i have to offer now im afraid is the time to discuss my criticismsfor one thing the storys cartoonish tone and sardonic attitude made it hard for me to really get invested in the dramatic aspects of the story and the show definitely wanted me to be invested and really care for the big dramatic revelations during the finale but i just wasnt buying into it the final episode was full of big twists that i saw coming a mile away partly because they were very unsubtle in setting them up but also because its actually such a cliche trope at this point the father character who the protagonist idealized is actually a bad man so shockingi found the introduction for lucys story to be interesting but as it went on it just repetitive and less and less engaging as it went on her disillusionment felt forced it was driven by a series of reveals where things she admired or cared about were systematically deconstructed and shown to be evil all along just like her dad and over and over that just kept happening and it just became trite and predictable before long i didnt feel any emotion for her story in the final episodethe ghoul whos also the cowboy actor im forgetting his name also had the same arc and his character was a symbol of the deconstructionist mentality of the entire script his false cowboy identity is the perfect metaphor for what this story is saying overall the cowboy is a myth thats just a nice looking mask for bad men who were violent and what not that heroic ideal isnt real its just a mask just like the ghouls wife isnt really a good woman shes a cartoonishly evil corporate monster who pretends to be good the one thing i actually like though about the cowboy angle is how its a reversal of lucys role in the story the cowboy tames the wilderness lucy is made wild by the wilderness that was pretty cooleasily the worst character in the story was maximus his contribution was so bland and poorly executed i wondered why they even included it he was a character i really felt nothing for they didnt stress what his attachment or investment in anything was i never felt his motivations properly i observed that he was unhappy with being bullied i guess but his murderous lying attitude made him fundamentally unlikable and stopped my from pittying him like i think the script wanted me to his plotlines are overly driven by convenience and contrivance and hes ultimately given a redemption arc that feels entirely unearned he also has a very thin and emotionless romance with the lead that i felt absolutely nothing for his friendship with the nonbinary brother was emotionless as well i just felt like every scene with him was a waste of screen timeoh and did i mention that not all the humor is funny and that when it isnt funny its actually fairly annoying a mismatch between silly ned flanders like performance and brutal violence or dialogue is only funny so many times before it gets oldand i dont know in general this show is so cynical and mean sprited it takes every opportunity to claim that wholesomeness or reciprocity is little more than a mask for selfishness it makes sure to try and disillusion the viewers of the idea of good guys as nothing more than naivete but then it has cartoonishly evil bad guys who are greedy illuminati types that have nothing but selfishbad intentions for their actions if believing in fundamentally good guys is naive then isnt believing in fundamentally bad guys because ultimately thats the same thing it just shifts a good guy into meaning not as bad as the really bad guysthe whole show mocks and insults the naivete of the vault dwellers and seems to suggest that their reciprocal ideal is old fashioned and just a cynical lie but i dont buy that i also dont think the story earns that as a conclusion i think it contrives that conclusion lucys story reminds me of the classic small town girl moves to the big city story shes from this small sheltered community and heads out to the real world and is forced to adapt and become less small town in order to make it i think thats where this whole shows philosophy comes from its city dwellers who have internalized the only look out for yourself ethic as universal and then cynically insist that everyone secretly feels the same way deep down and projecting that mentality onto an apocalypse suggests that its human nature to feel this waybut again that feels like a contrivance im certainly convinced that theres genuine value in those ethics that the show failed to confront and that failure made it hard for me to get invested in lucys character turn because i didnt feel disillusioned along with her i just felt like well they just decided to make everyone with that point of view a liar that feels totally contrived it doesnt prove or convince me of anythingperhaps youre an extremely cynical person or perhaps youre just not keen to interpret themes so intently if you read it at merely a surface level i could see enjoying it just for the jokes and the spectaclebefore the end of the review i must also point out the irony of the anti capitalist messaging in the show coming from amazon of all places thats totally richbut yeah not the worst show ever not by a long shot in fact it has many redeeming aspects and depending on how deeply you intend to read into the story or your worldview this could be more or less enjoyable i personally found the messaging to be a roadblock but i can see that hasnt been an issue for many others but i am having a hard time understanding why other people seem to think its well written as a narrative i just dont find it to be engaging or emotionally effective lucy is the only character i care about and the rest feel like  dimensional cartoons and little more the drama lacked drama so to speak but thats just how i feltits worth checking out regardless if youre not sold by episode  then turn it off
watching all the great reviews i thought this is finally a great series after a long time of mediocre us productions i couldnt get past the first episode of the game adaptation halo so i had hopes pinned up this would at least be somewhat betteri guess this just wasnt for me first five minutes of the series look really great and the graphics look awesome but the story is pretty predictable the acting could be way better some dialogues made me cringe first meeting with her soon husband she says whats your sperma count on another occasion they told me you were responsible yes they told me too and thats just in the first episodedoesnt get better in the later ones either stopped it halfway through and its not like there are many episodes you have to endure this just  but its super boring
never played the game but love post apocalyptic thrillers this one didnt disappointwalton goggins is amazing the whole cast really set this apart from other films and series of like genreto say this didnt carry some sense of realism regarding the world we live in would be a lie a least as far as the vault tec conglomerate is concerned its not hard to watch the news and see these type of scenarios are common place in western societyella purnell was intrinsic on screen and her character was all the more central because of her presenceseriously cant wait for season  to come
the decisions made in this show sometimes made me sick but i understood i took it to heart that okay maybe they have to make that decision and i kept watching and the ending made me salute my own decisioni have dived deep in the lore of fallout and the truth objectively is that the only games that stayed on the path for the entirety was   and nv fallout  and  had more of a  split of staying on the path and bad retconning but they are both great games i love they just somewhat damaged the universe i can live with thatthis show has taken decisions that i sometimes have disliked but the fact is that it is objectively great nomatter how much i am biased to think my headcanon is better the show stayed on the path so i cant play that gameto be able to make a fallout show this good makes it a  for me however robert edwin house must play a part in season kudos to the writerscreators exceptional job and if anyone actually bothered to read this review dont get mad at the diehard fans that are struggling to overcome their ncr being so viciously destroyed fallout was many youngsters start of thinking philosophically it sure was mine it took serious allocation of brainpower for me to understand
this show was so fun engaging and entertaining im usually not one to binge tv shows because i get bored eventually but i found myself staying up way past my bedtime to finish an episode i was actually shocked when i noticed each episode was about an hour long yes the lore was different but i think they made it work great the cast was fantastic as was the writing i was skeptical at first since so many movies and shows based on game series and toys have been coming out but the plot was excellent now i really wish id paced myself because i cant wait to watch the next season would highly recommend
 ⭐what a fun series its really tough to make game adaptations but jonathan nolan along with others did a masterful job production and cinematography were all top notch but what stood out the most for me was the casting and writing felt the cast really embodied the writing and understood where each character was coming from especially walter goggins ive always like him in westerns but he really stood out and did a superb jobi wish it was bit more pgish taking out the sexual content wasnt needed anyway just so i could watch this with my kids other than thatcant wait for season 
created by geneva robertsondworet and graham wagner and its cast includes ella purnell aaron moten walton goggins kyle maclachlan and moises ariassynopsisbased on one of the most important video game sagas of all time it is the story of the haves and the havenots in a world where there is practically nothing left to have  years after the apocalypse the peaceful inhabitants of the luxury lodges are forced to return to the irradiated hell left behind by their ancestors and are shocked to discover that an incredibly complex joyfully strange and very violent universe awaits themif the last us gave us some hope that video game adaptations would finally manage to be faithful to their origin today amazon studios is present with its spectacular adaptation of the popular game fallout the studio takes all the laurels under the eaves of its two creators geneva robertsondworet and graham wagner who faithfully and satisfactorily adapt this entire postapocalyptic world that represents the complexity in which the entire story takes place after fallouta careful and wellthoughtout work so as not to lose any of the blood that made the video game so popular but also without forgetting that it is a television adaptation and that it must also capture a neutral audience that work is done correctly where both fans of the game and viewers who connect with the story for the first time can enjoy a forceful concise and wellwritten series which makes you glued to the screen chapter after chapter without never lose the emotion of what we are seeing and the sensations that everything is increasing in satisfactionthe affection with which its creators take the series is essential for us to have a result that lives up to the satisfaction it generates the dose with which they offer us humor drama war survival and many more details in which the series surprises is a perfect cocktail to have a result that at times comes to surprise with its own ability to end up conquering known and unknown alikeeach chapter generates a successful journey through the action social reflections and constant plot twists that in the hands of its inspired directors we obtain refined and notable entertainment from amazon the series is very intelligent when it comes to measuring each substance to be delivered so as not to exceed the formulas that end up turning the series into something meaningless it is a series well measured in every detail and in each new option to be delivered which means that it always remains even and never falters in pace entertainment and emotiona perfectly chosen cast where no one clashes and each one gives their stamp to their already popular characters having walton goggins with his western attitude is the greatest possible pleasure but also having a charming ella purnell as the great protagonist is also a delight reflecting that her casting was totally a success in each of her performersa series that clearly becomes one of the best so far in  and without a doubt earns its place in the royalty of great video game adaptations to the small screen both the most fanatical and those looking for novelty will be totally pleased with a powerful proposal that makes use of their entire budget and their creative minds behind it it is a series that you should see even if you do not know the game or are not a fan because the series works from beginning to end with a forcefulness that does not give you room to doubt it at any moment and that is being faced with a great job that deserves to be appreciated by everyonethe fallout universe is welcome to adaptation royalty
i think the series does a very good job at telling a completly new story without completly adapting the original game the visuals come pretty close to it which is great for long time fans of the bethesda game series the dialogje is great and the cast does a great job at putting life into the their animated respective charakters i will definetly go onan rewatch it s soon as im done with writing this reviewing one of the best orginial series of the year i can tell i hope a second seaso will be announced soon and that they dont try to pull a tes on this one otherwise this would be very dissapointing
"the transitions are awful a fade to black every five minutes it constantly hops back and forth between four main charactersthe story invalidated every game but as a fan fiction it represents the games well if the games had hardly any enemiesonly three creatures were represented in this show and only a single one
everyone is either a bad actor or poorly directed its too nonserious you never build emotion tension and or any actual feelingthe cg is pretty rough and scaling isnt one to one with the gamesa weak fallout plot with daddyabandonment and trust issues at the core of the writing"
"i have not played this video game much to my partners dismay and despite his obsession with it its concept intrigues me but im just not much of a gamer i knew my partner was awaiting the release of this series with keen interest and judging by the trailers id seen it looked like the kind of show id enjoy my only concern was if id be unable to appreciate it since i havent played the game im writing this for any others out there who havent played the game but are considering checking out the showmy husband did pause the first episode at least twice to brief me on the overall timeline concept which i do have a slight issue with hard to believe that clothing furniture and home decor wouldnt have evolved not to mention other fields of science but okey dokey and later the ghoulsmutants had he not filled me in on those items im sure i couldve still watched the episode through to the end without feeling too bewildered its also easy enough to look up some basics on the games universe if you feel like you need to prepare beforehandwhat i loved
quick paced sleek look well edited solid cast and acting lots of action plenty of suspense and intrigue and a sprinkle of wry humor the first episode introduces us to the three major characters and three vastly different settings within the storys universe is compelling and very well done as the season progresses the show gets better every episode and leaves you wanting more its gripping smart fun thrilling and totally binge worthy if you are a fan of shows in the genre of postapocalyptic settings alternate timelines zombies sci fi action you should definitely give it a try it lives up to the hypeand for those who have played the game my husband said loved the show and that there were plenty of easter eggs in it to appease him as a fallout gamer fanboy 😊"
never having heard of the game fallout i came into this blind and had no idea what to expecti have to say i enjoyed the series and would like to see a series  but i really dont get reviews of  or higherare people seriously suggesting this series is better than the godfather or shawshank of course it isnt i appreciate its a series and not a film but ratings take account of the same aspectsacting is decent and some characters are likeable but not many to be honesti feel the story is stretched out and could probably have been done and dusted in  episodesgood but no oscar winner
i love the games and the fallout universe but from a story and character perspective this was terrible i found myself disinterested whenever the two main characters werent on screen maximum in particular was unbearable without the others im eager for a fan edit that removes this character and most of the ghouls backstory which was mostly pointlessfallout has explored vaulttecs history in many other ways that didnt just spoonfeed us information and instead allowed us to piece things together this approach felt like poor planning or storytellingwhile it was great to see the world the locations seemed to be taken directly from the games with nothing newin short its a lot of fan service and not much else
to be honest i was not expecting much but maybe because of that i found it to be very good acting is above average story is fine and there are so many elements reproduced near accuratelly from the game monsters weapons terminals basicallyallthere is dark humour enough horror scenes and quite a complex environment with characters and placesthere are some episodes that lack substance but overall it is a successfull first season i just hope they will keep it like that with the future ones alsoi would like and hope that they will add more action to it just a personal wishwaiting for next season
ive been a fan of the fallout franchise right from its early days in  i have played every single game some of them even multiple times ive even prepared meals from the recipes that came as a gimmick within the fallout  manual i literally grew up with the world of fallout thus i consider myself a true fallout nerdwith all of that being said i cannot express how glad i am that what ive witnessed with this cinematic implementation is with some mistakes which i consider to be forgiveable an absolute perfect fit the mood of the games the humour the sarcasm the criticism about our society the splatter and all the little details make this a must watch for everyone surely you can argue that not everything is golden but overall this season  is never letting you off the hook feeding you new information keeping the tension and suprising you with plot twists over and over againi cant wait for the second season letting us delve into the next chapter more please
"the bad
the brotherhood of steel is both strongly male and female not just male and not male chauvinist like the film portrays all of the video games present strong female leaders or characters in the brotherhood of steel and there are sisters too in the gamesalthough i agree with the story arc of maximus as its logical and as good as the other  main characters the leadership plotline with the bos is confusingforced and not sure why certain major moments happen in iti think the bos should have focused more on the risks maximus took out in the fieldnext the last episode  is rushed with way too many plotlines trying to find extension or closer it gets muddled and melodramaticthe great
you cannot deny the amazing acting and characterization of the  main characters in fallout tv showthe cowboy a super cowboy renegade with the most hilariously conceived western accent and aphorisms in any movie since tombstone give goggins a grammy please i was waiting for an ill be you huckleberry he rivals val kilmer he also plays  americana roles the cowboy and the salesman as well as the gigging grinding freelancerthe vault dweller a cute plucky and naive american portrayed by the oddly enough british actress ella purnell a mirror reflection from britain that i think we really needed she plays the role sublimely and hilarious and cute all the way through since she gained combat experience and it seems endurance with some bizarre form of charisma in the vault you are either waiting for her to kick some ass and get things done or take an injury all the way through with blissful anxietybrother maximus aaron moten i love this actor great portrayal with a slice of comedy intermixed hes a major force within the show of sympathy contradictions and self learning that he experiences along the way again the writers made him very individual like the other two all characters in the show seem to have multiple choices at their disposal so we are learning along the way to how they want to proceedall the other characters the npcs all of them are just amazing as in the video games especially dale dickey with the your kind aint welcome around here classic western line but all gussied up and her cackling and manic laughing give her a grammy as well and give the casting director an award too while youre at italso the sets are absolutely stunning and real while also the film was filmed with kodak film adding another layer of realism with celuloides infinite resolution and saturationthis movie is high grade americana in its purist most capitalist socialist cult and wildly adventurist form it kind of emphasizes that in america there really is no definition as to what it can become"
as someone whos played fallout for well over a decade all the way from fallout  to new vegas  and even  this show right here is a blueprint a framework an absolute lesson in how to accurately portray a video game into a live action environment where others like halo and witcher have failed fallout succeeds and then somei was first thrown off by the way it was telling the story with different perspectives from lucy maximus and the ghoul  really reminded me a lot of how witcher first started out and i was really worried that thats how it was going to go down but as the story progressed and the perspectives started to converge on one another where lucy meets the ghoul and maximus at the same time  i quickly realized that it wasnt like the witcher at all and the different character personalities and traits felt very much like characters out of the fallout showeach episode was gripping told a different side of the overall story and had all of these neat little subplots that helped advance the plot along in a positive way i personally really enjoyed the super duper mart episode because it felt like a side quest straight out of fallout  or the characters were all just downright amazing too of course my personal favorite was the ghoul  walton goggins just stole every scene he was in and his acting was just as good if not better than his work in justified such a criminally underrated actor ella purnells lucy and aaron motens maxmius were amazing protagonists and they both fit the mold for the backgrounds they were supposed to represent in the storythe end scene was the chefs kiss to the whole show and opened up the whole story to a whole new medium of the fallout show i hope and pray that s will be even better than s and that it doesnt devolve into something the fans dont want  much like how we saw in halo and witcherif you have prime and are thinking of watching the show wait no longer do it now and you wont regret it i hope
wow i loved this show i didnt know what to expect because i never played the game but it was awesome so unexpected it was so funny fun and with action and gore the actors are likable and perfect for the show i cannot wait to watch more written well and so much fun to watch this makes me want to play the video game i totally want to rewatch this show again the show is probably not for everyone but if you enjoyed watching the trailer you will love the show the concept of the show is surprisingly good and makes you think it also has shocking surprises check it out if you dont like it thats your problem enjoy
as a big fan of fallout  less a fan of  and the lore of the games i started the show and was somewhat disappointed the few first episodes did not really feel like fallout but as i got more and more into it it became better and betteri watched all the episodes in the spawn of two days i was glued to the screen after i survived the first episodesthey did a mighty fine job of staying mostly true to the fallout series while still making it their own show it does not feel exactly as the games felt but i believe its as close as it could possibly be to the source material without being a complete ripoffa few bits and pieces felt lackluster like where is the workbench which i at least used every time i played fallout  there were also a few more things but i wont mention it as i dont wanna give out any spoilersi do feel like the last of us the show did a bit of a better job at adapting the game into a show but of course they chose to stay closer to the source material than fallout the showfallout  is one of my favorite games and as far as this show goes it keeps me eagerly awaiting the next season i will definitely be along for the ride
as someone who has spent countless hours across all the fallout games i was very nervous when they announced this project videogame adaptations tend to be extremely disrespectful to their source material and try to do their own thing which almost all of the time turns out for the worse so i am very thankful that the fallout show carefully crafts its original narrative with proper admiration for the source material being canon does hurt the overall lore and depending on how much you liked the stuff it poorly handles you might loathe the showthe show opens with cooper howard with this one short scene done right before the bombs fell and destroyed the world its a very effective scene that gets you invested early on right after that they have a short scene introducing lucy which is a nod to all the skills of the series a bit after that they show different vault dwellers interacting i wont disclose much here as these interactions show how different the residents of every vault can be which is another thing nicely adapted from the games i do find the marriage subplot of the opening to be a bit too cringeworthy for my taste but hey it is something that feels straight out of fallout  lastly they introduce the brotherhood character of the show maximus and they do a really good job with him as well i think fans of fallout   and  would really dig lucy as the lead i myself do find her good but her romantic side only comes across as cringey to me plus as much as they try to make her a multidimensional character she remains very plain throughout the storythe production quality always looked immaculate i was just nervous that they would mess up the narrative and my concerns only got bigger when we found out that the show was going to be canon to the games the casting is well done and plenty of the characters just like the sets in the show ooze that good old fallout feel the visuals are the stars of the show for me it just looks completely immersive and topnotch they have so many tiny details right its unbelievable at times that such care was put into it and once again it is by far the best aspect of the shownaturally the show cant put every single great thing about fallout in one season but it does a decent enough job and treats the source material with utmost respect while telling its own story in this universe once again i just wish they didnt mishandle what they did as these are some of the most essential aspects of the games this show has plenty of potential so i hope this keeps improving as we get more and more seasonsfurthermore the story has some clear pacing issues and the characters arent that great either but it all ends very fittingly and if they can straighten these few sore bumps then we might have an incredible show on our hands by season  how it all comes together in the end is quite well done i wish it happened sooner though as for most of the show there is no captivating main driving force the initial ones only work for the first  episodes the writers couldve just had lucy meet some more intriguing characters throughout her journey this couldve fleshed out her character far more and kept the overall show far more engaging than it ismoreover i believe people will like all three leads lucy is a good character who serves as a decent character for the slow introduction of the series to those who have never touched a fallout game the ghoul cooper howard is a very morally corrupt character who leads most of the action sequences of the show the brotherhood newbie maximus is also a very likable addition weirdly enough to me he comes across as finn from star wars but is better written this will bring in so many new fans and i am very much looking forward to their impressions on the games
i am not a player but i watch my husband play  copilot  cheerlead for him i watch the surroundings  let him know if theres loot enemies coming etc hundreds of hours i even have my own collections in every settlement he builds and an island full of gorillas this show is just like that its so much fun the story line the humor the atmosphere the scenery the junk gun pure pleasure i love that they didnt hold back on the adult humor in an attempt to gain a larger audience i love all the questions it opened up in the lore i cant wait to see what happened in season two
this prime adaptation of bethesdas hugely successful game series does a surprisingly good job of both being a decent watch in its own right and of bringing the games to lifefallout was a wellchosen title to adapt its enormously rich in story creativity humour and atmosphere throughout its utterly immersive and full of fabulous convincing characters and placesthe story begins in the claustrophobic confines of vault  home to whats left of the human race in a postapocalyptic world and theyre a surprisingly cheerful and phelgmatic bunch until circumstances oblige our heroine lucy to leave the safe familiarity of the vault and go exploring the unknown wastelands above and then all hell breaks looseif you have played the games the look tone sounds and details will take you right back there and theres very little to complain about many of the scenes costumes and characters will be delightfully familiarbut is it great tv well yes and noi really enjoyed fallout and honestly i think there is much to like about it and its clear that some people who havent played the game and indeed might not normally be fans of this genre enjoyed it too  see the review by the usually hardtoplease lucy mangan in the gurdian for examplehowever personally im not convinced that it would be easy to get it if you come to this coldwhat do i mean by that well solidly delivered emotional or action scenes will frequently be punctuated by moments of very cheesy humour that could feel awkward but again are true to the source material the cheesiness is also quite effective relief from the very graphic if cartoonlike violence and horrorsimilarly some of the sets and studio lighting really look like something straight out of s tv cardboard rocks and painted backdrops but so what its a game adaptation  its allowed to look slightly unreal and even that production style feels deliberately chosen to add to the retro kitsch vibemeanwhile many of the characters are just great  walton goggins the ghoul chief among them with honourable mentions to sarita choudhary as moldava and michael emerson as wilzig aka the headelia purnell does a fine and charming job of carrying the lead as lucy maclean and its great to see kyle maclachlan appearing as her father  again a welcome throwback to worthy forebearers of this show including twin peaks and dune you know the other one but yes criticism of aaron motens turn as maximus is probably fair  his range of emotions seem broader when hes in the t suit than when hes out of itgive it a go you might like it if you played the game i reckon its a  if not its still fun if you go with the flow and if you dont like it well its not the end of the world
the only reason studios have resorted to making nonstop remakes of original properties is because you keep watching them and thinking theyre good you see the creativity of the original showing through without understanding that the people who made the show had absolutely nothing to do with that aspect and they only can take credit for the bad parts of the show like the lazy and stupid writing the nonsense plot holes the actors who dont really know anything about the source material and are just following a poorly written script and pretty much everything else about the show that you can overlook if the show looks right the sad part is the people who were responsible for the design the characters setting and overall story have nothing to do with the show they just receive a check in exchange for allowing corporate executives to butcher their work it doesnt matter if the lead character is cute and likable and they have little nuka cola caps on the cover any idiot can watch a video essay about the fallout games and drain a multimillion dollar budget to make something that looks true to the source material its just a trick the studios are playing on audiences so they wont notice that nothing they create is an original story anymore fallout last of us euphoria game of thrones the boys every tv show nowadays is just a remake of something that already existed there is no originality in our shows or movies anymore that will only stop if you the viewer stop feeding into it all the glowing  star reviews for this lazy garbage all say the same thing dont listen to the fans that should tell you all you need to know
i never played the game but when i saw a trailer of this series my attention was caught for me its a mix of star wars the last of us alien and the walking dead sure the storyline is pretty straight on with no difficult timelines or whatever like dark or  but boy its entertaining and somehow its keeps you hooked the visuals are great acting it pretty good and the story never gets slow lucy is a likable main character not to strong and with human naivetiesyou can sense its a game adaption with all the hardcore action and arcade  over the top shootings but not in a way youre looking at a b movie or something
the game fallout has been playing since  and has an extremely large crowd of fans in the meantime since  fallouts rights have been sold to bethesda with  games added to the shelves and a number of additions to them anyone who knows the games will have labeled this a bit as fairly unfilmable still jonathan nolan yes christopher nolans  years younger brother wanted to burn his hands on the fallout project jonathan is only more adept at the writers part and whoever looks at his cv sees that he hardly has anything to his name as a director the series takes place within the same continuity as the video game franchise but has become an original story of its own executive producer todd howard said he wanted to prevent the video games from being tweakedespecially people who are not familiar with the fallout franchise will really have to get used to the weird setting for the first two episodes the atmosphere in the series is very strong and lives up to the game but the luguber humor and the completely strange things that happen will make the eyebrows frown for a while precisely because the world of fallout is so atmospheric and well portrayed this series has perhaps become one of the best game adaptations ever at least thats what i think from the third episode the whole thing starts to get a bit more structure and you will also understand where the whole thing wants to go in the end you actually skip between several lines in the story for example there is the story of lucy who goes through the desert together with ghoul cooper maximus who ends up in a bizarre situation as a turtle of knight titus and of course how vault  wants to pick up the thread again but does not know how to deal with their captured killers but in order to fully understand the big picture we have to go back to the beginning and thats exactly where fallout worksin episode  structure begins to come into the series and it becomes clear where the big picture wants to go every storyline remains equally interesting and the absurdism is only increasing but exactly how everything is put together remains unclear until the last episode and we also have to go back to the whole beginning fortunately for the rest it doesnt matter whether you have played the games or not the series may then connect with the world of fallout and constantly hint to things from the games yet the series follows its own path and prior knowledge is absolutely not required everything is just well worked out and it reminded me from time to time to time the books of the dark tower by stephen king which i would like to see filmed in this way and im not talking about that halfgare film from  fallout is just surprisingly good and brings this to the man with a lot of gore and weird humor after the  episodes youre still looking for a second seasonfallout  season  is perhaps the best movie of a game ever prior knowledge is absolutely not necessary because although the story takes place in the world fan of the games it completely follows its own path as a neutral viewer you will still have something about the first two episodes of what are you actually looking at but after that the story starts to take shape with  episodes ranging from playing time from  minutes to an hour it looks away wonderfully and quickly one must have a strong stomach by the way because some scenes are in no way inferior to a spicy horror film so this is definitely not suitable for young viewers eventually when the end has come you will crave for more but it will be a while for a second season and although nothing is known about that yet it is quite a certainty that it will really come
fallout the popular postapocalyptic video game series that has been on the consoles of game lovers for years since its release in  was brought to the screens this year by amazon studios in the directors chair are names such as jonathan nolan whom we know from westworld and clare kilner who we know from her work in house of the dragon therefore it would not be wrong to say that the series has created great expectations judging by the comments received immediately after its release both fans and new viewers are very pleased with the product we can thank prime video for releasing all the episodes at the same time instead of spreading them over weeks and allowing us to watch them uninterruptedly and move on to why the series is so goodif we take a look at the story for those who are not aware of the games we witness how a civilization that was destroyed as a result of the nuclear bomb attack on america in  was established  years later colonies that we are familiar with from most postapocalyptic moviesseries are also included here one of these colonies is the formations called shelters which were created for the survival of civilians due to the danger of sinous nuclear war our journey begins when our main character lucy a resident of the shelter who only reads about life in books descends into the outside worldwe also get to know many different groups during this journey technological soldiers which are indispensable in apocalyptic science fiction are handled here under the name of the brotherhood of steel during our journey we also meet ghouls a mutated human type that is one of the building blocks of fallout games in fact the three main characters we see are representations of these groups although there are many theories within the groups in the fallout universe the backgrounds and goals of these characters are written quite successfullyit is also worth saying that the world built in the series has its own style although a nostalgic american dream picture is drawn in terms of songs radio programs clothes in short culture a retrofuturistic atmosphere has been achieved with the use of artificial intelligence and robots especially the music choices from the s in the action scenes and the fact that we watch most of the scenes in slow motion make it very enjoyable to watch despite the blood and brutality we can say that our director nolan who is already a fan of video games thought about every detail while bringing the universe to the screen costume designs are also part of this by the way we should not mention the name of amy westcott the costume designer of the series because the costumes are all handmade yes even the armor of the brotherhood of steel armies while the uniform uniforms we see in the sanctuary and the brotherhood of steel reflect discipline and the existence of rules with an almost school atmosphere the very punk styles of those in the outside world allow us to visually dominate this universe where partisanship arisesafter giving our spoiler warning for the rest of the article we can go into a little more detail about the series we follow a plot connected to three main characters our beginning is when lucy goes to the outside world to find her kidnapped father the motto of the postapocalyptic pollyanna lucy character we will make america a better place of course fades away as she stays in the outside world that is the real world at this point the producers did not set out with the concern of not being political and placed sociological criticisms into the story in a very appropriate and humorous manner ella purnell who brings our character to life talks about how exciting it is to handle the journey of such a naive and privileged person in the real world as if she were a newborn baby at the same time the character of lucy was written specifically for the series even though we witnessed their naivety and strange reactions at the moment of crisis we say it is a good thing that it was written because it is one of the characters that increases our sympathy for the seriesin the development part we are welcomed by maximus our new knight of the brotherhood of steel and our antihero cooper howard the ghoul who makes us feel the suspicion of there is something up with this in every move he makes and whose charisma does not take away from his lack of a nose cooper howard is shown in parts in the series as past and present but in the last two episodes we see that it constitutes a very important part of the story and even itself there is an interesting surprise about this character in the series in the part where the character gives his number so that they can contact the refuge phones if you actually dial the number you can hear the cries of someone being tortured for help now you know which number to dial to escape boring meetingsalthough the brotherhood of steel is a technologically advanced group it is certain that not much goes into their huge armor they are a community that is very committed to its own truths and to put it bluntly a bigoted community this group of soldiers in particular was the one with the most connection to our world because what we see in the brotherhood of steel is nothing more than a nationalist army of soldiers it seems that the bullying among the ranks which we also see in american culture will not lose its effect even after centuries have passed revenge ambition and conscience which are indispensable concepts when dealing with a war issue are especially woven into maximus storythe fact that the series received so much acclaim when it was first released brings with it comparisons one of those series is the last of us which has been talked about for a long time since its release although they are similar because they are adapted from a postapocalyptic video game i think they are in very different leagues due to the difference in how they operate while the last of us is in a darker and dramaheavy universe fallouts relatively cynical atmosphere clearly separates the twothe only point i was stuck on was that i strongly felt that the series was a video game adaptation even though the producers intended the opposite although seemingly unrelated events were connected to each other towards the end without leaving any question marks in mind they tired me a little at first still we consumed it as a holiday treat and it is a perfect recommendation for those looking for a tv series to bingewatch
i never written a review but had to for this show since i would be considered an og of the game series  ive been waiting years and years for a show and we finally got one  im stoked for season  seeing new vegas gave me a rush  what can we expect to see  the house  the boomers  caesars legion  great khans  the kings  id like to see the institute or railroad eventually but thats whats great about this series  the possibilities are endless  the fo series is set up with tide turning action and drama situations but also has great corky weird scenarios and characters to give it that missing ingredient of dark humor and comedy in general  love how you are all bringing the wasteland to life i love how they follow a few different characters continue to raise the bar and drop jaws  hopefully we begin to see more games being adapted into shows and movies  its kinda what every gamer who wants more of a gamegenre wishes for looking forward to seeing fallout merch and gamesgame apps being available also theres no way you can miss  this right here is pure gold you struck
i took the time to write a review which is something i typically wouldnt do however this show is so good i actually care to to you it is ive played hours of every fallout game until my eyes would figuratively bleed from so much exposuremy point is imo a majority of video games which were either made into movies or tv shows turned out to be terrible no presentation captive story telling acceptable acting etc this show is an exception it has the ability to draw firsttime players to the game and also fills longtime gamers with joy i highly recommend to both audiences i was surprisingly impressedi wouldnt be surprised if the success of this show brought us fallout  sooner than later
fallout may be the surprise hit of the year so far i have only played fallout  and absolutely loved it and have knowledge of the rest i tend not to like what amazon does outside of a few things here and there this show has taken over pop culture right now and that is honestly quite surprising given video game movies and shows never seem to landthe show is well acted well paced and they truly put he money into it to do the story justice the set designs are great the music is fantastic it has many nods to classic westerns and the  main story lines the show follows all feel like they could be their own quality moviemy only even possible complaints are fairly minor the story features so much plot armor it causes the show to feel downright hoaky and corny at a lot of times it also struggles to find a tone i think the games find a perfect mix of comedy and despair where the show leans way more into despair across the boardoverall fallout does its legendary source material proud and i for one and excited for season 
first things out of the way the first episode was a hot mess but the show quickly recovered and pushed out a decent season i did not like the opener at all as major part of the fallout games experience was the whole life inside the vault here all that is done horribly rushed out and we are kicked down the road as quickly as they can film it theres also too many incomplete flashbacks random events and all over the place jumping in that one episode as far as pilots go this is one of the worst ive seen in a while however as i said they quickly move on from that and the rest of the episodes are finewhy do i call it halo lite well because throughout the whole season it reminded me of halo in so many ways contrary to the games they went for military adaptation over survival shoving the armor of the brotherhood to the center the lone protagonist player in the wasteland that the games are focused on is not a thing here the series world is all about faction vs faction instead of vault dweller vs the unknown support characters are irrelevant and meaningless beyond their singular use followed by death or removal from screen timethe series goes straight into chasing some item making it the focal purpose of the season just like in halo you are chasing the artifacts all the elements that halo show revolved around so does fallout corruption conspiracies secret motives etc etc at the same time we know the games are not the same at all yet the shows are basically very close to each otherwhere they differ is in that fallout tries to be light they go for the comedic here and there and not all doom and gloom serious business every scene i am not sure i am a fan of this fallout is not a parody and beyond the comedic contrast of the vault with the outside the world is not like we see here they removed the doom and gloom and we have some censored washed up zombie series where characters are overly quirky and downright stupid some scenes feel straight out of idiocracy to the point i had to look up the cast to see if they are the same people fallout obviously samples other shows and we cannot get around that its beyond obvious at times mad max still has the best wasteland characters with the most logical behavior for the setting even waterworld uses more sense in building screen extras just for extra convincing lost makes a cameo with ben linus reprising his lost character in fallout i mean this down to his manners speech looks everything nice easter egg honestly but also come on guys be original still seeing linus again after all this years felt good i wonder if the island survived the nuclear fallout since the timeframe of dharma corp on the island does fit the period of fallout flashback scenes homage is sometimes underappreciated but not always relevantsimply stated the show is not realistic we see a bunch of specifically shown injuries and i can tell you from personal experience you are not trekking across the desert with those injuries the pain alone would be unbearable the pain of utilizing those damaged body parts would be unfathomable lets just ignore attempts that this is serious in any way and focus around what they went fortheir goal was to make something fun based on a stylized version of the game it feels like it with all the forced naivety and sanitized wasteland the only reason the show didnt burn was because it is fun it is not dull and you want to keep watching just to see it is not perfect and its overall rating on here is just absolutely inflated but for all the runtime they do a decent job keeping it together there are plot holes there are odd choices made and one must never forget this is not serious science fiction if one does not dissect it apart it works yet if you begin to nitpick it has lots of things wrong with it fortunately what it has is good enough and entertaining enough master chief of the spartans meet knight maximus of the brotherhood
first of all i want to apologize for my english heres my opinion on falloutwhile fallout might not be everyones cup of tea due to some gritty scenes its hands down one of the best productions in recent years sure there are some nitpicks like the forced character encounters at times but theres no denying its a stellar adaptation of the gaming world crafted by bethesda the attention to detail coupled with topnotch production and a cast that nails it makes this series a current phenomenon highly recommended if youve got the stomach for iti hope the second season of the fallout series which has already been confirmed lives up to the first and doesnt disappoint
its ok not great but watchable considering it came from the maker of the abomination rings of poop i was expecting it would be horrid and amazon made the garbage wheel of time show too amazon has a history of ruining established ips but fallout was passable the story was typical for the setting anyone familiar with fallout would recognize the standard plot the characters were acceptable i thought ella purnell was decent in the lead role and she wasnt a total girl boss at least they tried to explain her combat skills her performance was a little flat at times but passable aaron moten was decent i liked his characters arc but his performance was sometimes unconvincing like purnell it was a little flat i wonder if this was more about directing than acting walton goggins was excellent as the ghoul definitely the best character in the show im a fan of michael emerson and would have liked to have seen more of his character more dogmeat please none of the characters made me want to stick a fork in my eye when they came on screen which was refreshing for modern entertainment there was a little identity politics sprinkled in but minimal compared to most moviesshows and it did not distract from the story i probably would not have noticed it if not for the in your face saturation that happens in most shows these days the ending was weak and really drawn out showing something slowly doesnt make it more meaningful it was ok but not great
i never played the games so im watching this as objectively as i can and keeping an open mind after watching most of the episodes i have some mixed thoughts there are some excellent moments that build tension and drama very well then there are moments that seem completely out of place these great moments convey a graveness and severity that is almost always broken by some ill thought out joke or plot point if you do it once unexpectedly or set it up well it can be funny doing it poorly over and over just makes it seem odd and breaks the viewers engagementthe show will put in the time to build up a critical situation theyll show a very violent gore filled scene and then cap it off in a shallow attempt at comedy if it was written better it would probably have worked but it comes off as haphazard and awkward too often its almost as if the writers or showrunners dont want the show to be taken too seriously or become too frightening for the audience which is strange for a post apocalyptic drama it also lacks consistent quality writing flow and consistently engaging plot points that would allow it to take comedic libertiesthere are some great elements some characters ghoul wilzig and the elder and plot arcs are interesting they will show a great scene then lose the momentum they just built by shifting to others that are poorly done it is so strange to have these amazing visuals only to then be awkwardly interrupted by unnecessary moments or a weird soundtrack that is out of place the raid in the first episode leaves so many unanswered questions and just seems so implausible and forced the character take so many actions that dont make any sense the  reviewers dont have any issues with the plot or show at allthe characters dont seem to question these strange inconsistencies either even when they do the other characters have no answers and so they just move on as if it never happened this is another symptom of lazy writing i understand that they are trying to keep some mystery while building the plot but ultimately there is too much that is glossed over or is missing entirely there are good moments and the writing can be good but there are always a few moments every episode that leave me shaking my head its a shame that there is so much going for this show but the writers just keep falling short
i am really glad that this adaptation wasnt ruinedi am a big fan of the games and it brings me joy to see it go throughit is slow in the beginning with the world building stories therefore for someone who comes from the game with knowledge about the world it can get boringbut it is done right and after ep i was sucked in and binge watched until the endthere are some inconsistencies but they are easy to overlook for regular audience which is the target audience but there are easter eggs and mentions for us folksacting is good most of the timesline up is perfect as far as i am concerned and very well pickedgore and action arent over the top and blends in with the themestory is intriguing and captivating and makes you crave morethey did a really good job with costumes and cgi which are good and in placeall in all solid  and i cant wait to see the next season
after feeling that streaming had past its halcyon days for a while now different platforms have blown me away over the last couple of weeksripley was a superb retelling of a book i love and now this drops straight afterive never seen or played the game am aware of some of the imagery but not any characters or narrative so for me this has to stand alone and i have no idea if it is true to the sourcehowever who cares i know its popular to moan about things not respecting source material but if its this good cant we just enjoy itthe best bit for me is the overarching narrative of big business taking control of governments feel relevantthe main characters are well established and brilliantly played with some of the side characters feeling a little underdonethe story was defined and well executed with just enough tension and confusing to keep me guessingdecent dialogue dark and sometimes childlike humour work together with superb production values and directionits funny weird engaging and in some places brilliantly goryis streaming getting its mojo back
ok so im not a gamer but i have always liked the look and lore of fallout especially fallout  follow an inhabitant of the nuclear fallout shelter  as she goes on a quest outside and encounters sights and lifeforms of extreme diversity the sandy complex post nuclear holocaust world is far more complex and nuanced than regular post nuke films and the show switches between the past and present to flesh out the characters and plot expect surprises  extreme gore scifi stuff wild plot reveals on a par with the first season of westworld and with a great cast this is a rare gem among recent tv
everything about this series is perfect fallout down to the cast to cinematography writing casting characters everything director etc everyone who worked on this huge props to you every episode has you hooked wnating more each episode ones you see one you cant get enough and wanting more been missing this in a show for a long time walton goggins character hes an incredible and lucy maximus and i am excited for season  warning heavy spoilers read at your own risk the fact that they are adapting fallout new vegas my favourite and best fallout ever made im so hyped to see future of this show
i started watching this show because i was curious about the game  which ive never played  and also because it has a good ratingwell the first season is done and i finished watching it in two days its that interesting the plot twists and story keep you hooked from the getgo and the character arcs keep you guessing what our heroes will do nextfor example the ghoul starts off as a cool dude then does some shady surfies stuff and then slowly becomes an antihero figure of all the characters he is probably my favorite because of his complete lack of correctnessthere is a romantic side to the story which i dont much care for but i guess you cant have your cake and eat it toodefinitely looking forward to season  and yes i do recommend watching this if you like scifi with a healthy serving of bloodshed
two big points that i have to say cgi and story line are mediocre at best there are a couple of scenes where you find yourself saying damn and laughing at some obviously inserted humor but there are so many plot holes completely unnecessary plot points and some characters have plot armor that is so thick that its just silly bulletproof and luckier than a four leafedrabbits foot unfortunately if you are a fan of the franchise you will be so confused at what is actually happening in the show all while trying to piece together all of the lore that they casually sprinkle into the show its cool to see fallout on the big screen with great props and decent enough casting but its just ehh if youve never played the games and youre looking to binge something then i am sure you will enjoy the show but anybody with a familiarity of the game will most likely be disappointed
 acting is sometimes great but the contrast between the great acting and amateurs in this is a bit too much sometimes especially with the maximus character his acting is pretty bad and his friend in training camp also bad when they interact with the good actors it is jarring and sometimes i just need to skip ahead it is so bad and cringeworthy direction is okay not amazing some parts are  second shots  seconds shots  second shots and it is tiktok monkey brain some long shots are poorly done flat feel like a green screen scifi channel pacing is a bit too slow sometimes and a bit too fast at times for dei and the message bs in this how can you have a world of strong people at the top ranks of their military be a whiny femboy makes no sense for the world also making a lot of black characters positions of authority while the whites are just dumb idiots of course for actual character development which is lacking in showsoverall still feels a bit like a scifi channel show and wish they follow the source material a bit more as in staying tru to the world and please quit with the dei bs and know your audience
fallout was such a joy to witness in live action especially being such a huge fan of the game series what is awesome about fallout is even if you have never played one entry in the video game series you still will have a blast with this amazon tv series it moves at a fast pace with high violence gore action and alot of comedy its everything i would have dreamed for in a fallout tv series and more what is also very nice is this tv series is not a straight story out of the video game but instead a new story set in the fallout game universe i loved how season  wrapped up and im looking forward to a season  amazon has a huge hit on their hands here fallout gets a perfect  stars out of 
its a new view on the fallout universe and in my opinion its good if you love bethesda latest releases  fo and fo you will love watch and rewatch this seriesif youre more a obsidian  originals youll surely have a more critical view but try to watch it for what it is  a new aproach on a beloved universe and if you dont like the games and just want a post nuclear world like mad max or something with a more serious tone just avoid it at all costs  isnt for you its for the bethesdafallout game fansits entertainingfun to watch but with some debatable choices like choosing a more humorous aproach instead of the lore friendly one or the depiction of some characters ghouls or  monsters creatutes its generally filled with solid and sometimes good acting moments what makes it good but not great
i played the games and this tv adaptation felt like a parody with a vibe akin to mars attacks and stepford wiveswhile the games do occasionally have humour that i would describe as cheeky or even dark this tv adaptation is just plain silly immature and goofy missing are also the sometimes scary aspects of the games as well as large and lengthy action scenes with raiders robots and mutated humans and animals each new building or location in the games is exciting and unpredictable whereas here in the tv series the locations are repetitive the scenes dull and goofythe acting or direction of the actors is mostly cartoonish but sometimes inconsistently seriousdramatic the script is immature with sexual dialogue that feels out of place the overall plot is paper thin the behaviour of characters is unrealistic and illogical and relationship development nonexistent or unbelievable there are no heroes to be found nor a mission or characters to stand behind and root for yes there is a treasure of sorts that everyone is after but we dont find out what that is or does until the last episode so the viewer doesnt know what theyre supposed to be excited about it seems as though the main focus for the writer was to come up with a plot twist for the last episode and then conscious of a low budget construct plodding filler episodes between the first and last and pad them out with irrelevant dialogue while neglecting to build lovable characters with story arcsconsidering how rich the world of the fallout games is the writer didnt seem to care to really go deep with anything as everything feels superficial the only real credit i can give is to the production team who went above and beyond to faithfully recreate and bring to life all the art and design of the games it makes for a really fun easter egg hunt its a shame because the tv series looks like fallout but it doesnt feel like fallout
"i played all the fallout games and had a great time watching it there are references to every game in the series so people who have played at least one game will get their share of the nostalgia cakethe only thing that bothered me was the typical americanracial convention of the series which in itself doesnt bother me there is and must be this american vibe throughout fallout because thats what this game is based on but that makes it easy to guess whats going to happen eg in the first episode the husband is white so i already knew it was going to be bad although when i saw him i thought he was either a drug addict or a violent person but then the frame showed that everyone was dirty and cut up and i already knew who they were because people from the crypt dont look like that maybe they were subjected to some kind of experimentapart from this small stumble the series is very well made the set designers did a great job looking at the locations and their filling although they were probably afraid to play more aggressively with the light the actors played well where moises arias
walton goggins and jon daly definitely the bestoverall a very good series"
this was just such a pleasant surprise i was super skeptical when i heard it was being made given the track record on adaptations made from games but dang if they didnt absolutely nail this it honestly feels like once the green light was given those in charge basically said we got the ip to do itnow make it damn good the casting the writing the acting is so damn well done there is a surprise in every episode the world building is second to none and keeps you engaged throughout the eight episodes heck ive one episode left and i almost dont want to watch it because i know its going to an age before season  just outstanding
a must watch for everyone there is not anything negative to say unless you dig so deep that it just becomes pointless sad and desperate the pacing is better than anything else ive seen in years the actors are phenomenal for each and every single role the set and world bulding is amazing a solid  so is music sound effects story atmosphere and so onas soon as i understood the fact that the show would focus on multiple characters i was a bit worried i was set on the whole show being focused around a «player» lol but i quickly fell in love with two of them dont get me wrong i enjoy the knight as well but he dont come close to as good as our adorable curious and most of all beautiful vault dweller and ofc the gunslinger ghoul who im sure is everyones favourite in my opinion the ghoul stole the whole show and i dont mind at all his story is so intriguing brilliant and fascinatingand i almost forgot to mention the dog that im sure everyone loves as well the dog is perfect and the best scenes in the show is whenever our gunslinger walks with the doggo on his side cant wait for season 
as a longtime fan of fallout especially new vegas and  i was looking forward to this series since i saw the trailer a month prior i binge watched the entire series in two days and i wasnt disappointed at allin typical fallout fashion the story takes place in on a postnuclear apocalyptic world particularly the ruins of los angeles california there we follow three main widely varying protagonistsfirst theres lucy maclean a naive but determined and idealistic vault dweller who leaves her home vault  to find her father who was abducted by a raider chieftain named moldavernext theres maximus a downtrodden aspirant of the brotherhood of steel who gets unexpectedly promoted to squireand finally we have howard cooper aka the ghoul the most cynical jaded and experienced protagonist who was once a prewar actor before becoming a mercenary after the apocalypseyoull also see longtime fallout canine character dogmeat for you doglovers out therethe main plot of first season revolves around a wildgoose chase for the severed head of a scientist named dr wilzig which carries a big secret that could change the entire world from there the main story expands into a few sub plots for each character in an immerse and creative mannerfirst of all the aesthetic was superb and fully captured the game in every category from the vault to the wasteland to the very items weapons enemies items etc everything matches the source material youll almost feels like youre playing a fallout game as you watch the show plus the action sequences were as exciting as they were fitting for a fallout setting longtime fans will definitely be reminded of their past combat experiences with the slowmotion vats styled intervalsthere was plenty of character development and interactions among all three characters lucy becomes tougher and more hardened by the harsh realities of the wasteland among other things maximus becomes disillusioned with the brotherhood yet ironically a respected member in the process and even forms a romance with lucy and cooper eventually transforms from an enemy to an uneasy ally to lucy as they continue their journeythe music was a captivating mix of different sources there is an original soundtrack by ramin djawadi who took inspiration from fallout composer inon zur himself plus youll hear multiple original songs and leitmotifs that any fallout fan with recognize from past games and plenty of golden oldies from real musical artists such as johnny cash dinah washington and the inkspotsthe special effects were a breathtaking mixture of cgi and practical effects that fully capture the fallout universe the mutant creatures such as radroaches gulpers and a yao guai were beautifully detailed personally i cant wait to see a deathclaw in future seasons i especially liked the brotherhood knights dressed in their t power armor suitsoverall this show succeeded where halo failed and is a must watch for fallout fans or just about anyone interested in the postapocalyptic genre
have played all the associated game titles starting  years ago and outright love the concept of human greed moral dilemmas satire gore etc to my joy the tv series is  true to the games incl character progression stores and npcs factions companions environments details and soundtrack  excellent and above expectations extra credits for recreating red rocketthe big difference compared to the games is that the tv series is of high production quality maybe bethesda will pick up a few pointersthe tv series isnt following a specific game title but seem to somewhat mix from each which i find perfectly fine similarly flashbacks are used in a good way for story and character buildup the pace of the story ought to leave plenty of room for additional seasons
this show is brilliant the humor the style the drama the details the atmosphere the characters the actors the soundtrack just unbelievable i havent had so much fun watching the first couple of episodes of any tv show for quite some timeyou get thrown right into this world from the start with all its lore and aesthetics and you want to see more explore it all even as a passive viewer they doing an incredible job taking you with them into the retrofuturistic lands of postnuclear america bringing you joy laughter tenderness art slapstick gore irony and stuff to think about sometimes even all in one scenei can highly recommend this show to anyone with a deep sense of humor and the hopes to find something great to watch out of the ordinaryplease bring us more seasons like that
i was so excited for this one cause i really liked arcane and cyberpunk the witcher even the last of us was decent enough that i did not feel a slog watching through it warcraft was not a  for me i still liked itbut out of all of these fallout has one of the most interesting world in video games say what you want about the quality of their later games but they know how to build the worldsfallout tv show starts out great they go over the skills and you start feeling good about it but then it all falls a part i personally think the premise of  vaults is not a bad one but the execution was there are so many plot holes and the people are made out to be just stupid that is the biggest crime of all everything is so goofy the outside world looks good but not great you do get the fallout feeling but is so empty a girl who comes from a vault and is bright and stupid at the same way get trough it all like there is no danger at all always someone there to save her what was she gonna do dive after the gulper if cooper did not kidnap her there are so many moments like that plot armor is think on this onei liked episode  and  they were the most action packed but the overall writing is just bad it just makes no sense that makes this show for someone who sees things logically a really hard watch and not logically as everything has to be like in real life but in the fallout world logic in games the protagonist is weak at the beginning but finds things along the way to aid himher i was hoping so much she finds something a melee weapon maybe nopelets talk about vaults so the vault  and  are supposed to be puppets for vault  management who sends overseers for those two vaults jet somehow the vault of  dies out  years before we see the show and no one knew really and we are supposed to believe that a tiny brain bot that cant even navigate is somehow the mastermind who controls all of it mind you all are wearing pitboys when the supposed raiders from vault  are coming to visit and none of them detect radiationlets talk about the supposed raiders you telling me that a woman who wants to heal the world goes into a vault and murders innocent people mind you they have a colony of their own where they actually could clean up but they go to the visit all dirty what about the plot we see lucy taking the husband to her room where she finds out that he is not from the vaults but outside cause of the radiation warning the pitboy gives and the vault  died out  years ago and what are we supposed to believe that those  years someone sat in the overseers computer and set up the marriage some how plausible but its such a stretch how did the raiders suddenly appear in armor and weapons was no one watching out for the vault there were no guards in every fallout world that has people living in the vaults they have guardsi mean i could write double what i have already said about the plot holes and inconsistencies trough out the show but i think you get the point i actually think it would have been better not having played the games at all before this that way i would not have had many questions that might have ruined it for methe first season ended in a high note for me though heres to hoping second season mends the mistakes of the first oneamong my friends most people do not like the showstravelers stranger things band of brothers narcos arcane the umbrella academy blood of zeus and game of thrones etc that i like and most like the shows that i do not so maybe this review speaks of just some of the people who are gonna watch it but for those who have played the games i think this is not the best
ive only played a bit of fallout  on ps years ago and this makes me want to play more of the games available at least for me since i only have ps now regardless would highly recommend this to anyone the amazing flow of directing soundtrack is fire casting is great and i must say i enjoy anything from jonathan nolan ironically my last name is nolan im just not related to anyone famousi havent had amazon since january before today the fallout series is perfect choice back to the service in my opinion amazon and hbo are the best entertainment i never understood the hype with netflix its enjoyable occasionally anyways though fallout is phenomenal in every aspect i appreciate the authenticity of the of everything put into everything i definitely want to play more of the games soonseriously my review got hate already if it makes a difference i have autism
note i completed the fallout  game but do not consider myself to be a fan per sethe tv adaptation of the beloved video game fallout has finally hit the screens and while it brings the iconic postapocalyptic world to life with impressive art direction and set design it struggles in some critical areas particularly storytellingfirst and foremost the representation of the games world is superb the art direction is amazing capturing the essence of fallouts retrofuturistic aesthetic with incredible attention to detail the sets are beautifully crafted showcasing the passion and dedication of the production team however while the cgi is generally good there are moments where it could have used a bit more polishthe shows gore is in line with the fallout ip and while it is integral to the universe it can occasionally feel a bit distracting this however is a minor gripe and largely forgivable given the context of the seriesdespite these strong points the shows storytelling is not perfect one of the main issues is the improbable frequency with which characters run into each other in the vast wasteland this constant string of coincidences strains credulity and detracts from the otherwise immersive experiencecharacter comparisons also fall a bit flat maximus for instance feels like a clone of finn from star wars lacking a unique identity similarly the ghoul character comes across as a rehashed version of william from westworld these similarities diminish the originality that fans expect from a fallout adaptationmoreover character consistency is another area where the show falters lucy for example is portrayed as naive due to her upbringing yet she demonstrates formidable combat skills this juxtaposition of naivety and adeptness in fighting creates a disconnect as her level of training should realistically come with a better understanding of the dangers of the wasteland while her moments of comedy are relatable they sometimes translate into frustration when she fails to recognize obvious threatsoverall fallout is not a bad show i was entertained and i will be watching season  it offers a visually stunning experience with high production values however it falls short of brilliance due to its storytelling flaws and character inconsistencies its an enjoyable watch but it doesnt quite reach the heights of shows like succession or severance
i fellout of my couch because i had fallen asleep in episode three was it because it was boring was it because it was insipid was it because it was so contrived was it because all the actors were bland not only unbelievable but unrelatable i am convinced it was of all the abovepro looks bright and colorfulcons cg is smeared on some of the creatures and looks almost as bad as the scorpion king movie too plastic and silly moving especially the mutated bear it looks awfulwalton goggings is walton no matter the role whether it be in the shield soa fallout he is always going to be waltonthe lead is silly annoying and unbelievablethe music is atrocious at first it is novel and cute but by the middle of episode one the yankovich style covers get really old really fast the rest of the old rehashed songs of the s and s just get mind numbingly tritethe writing in very lazy we have to go here to see this but first have to do this and see that before we can actually do anything just terribly lazythe rest of the cast is exactly what we hollywood has been directed to feed us no substance or relatable traitseasy pass on this one
the first episode really primes you for what looks like is going to be one of the best adaptations made the whole premiere plays like an epic moviefantasy and scifi novels anime and video games have been adapted as movies and tv shows for a long time but they mostly fall short but fallout really seems promising from the first episode after watching it i immediately felt like bingewatching the whole seasonthe fan service references to a multitude of familiar things from the games really makes the gamer in me squirm like a teenager the storytelling giving us three very different perspectives that help bridge the gap for the audience that isnt acquainted with the fallout lore the perfect composition for the first episode that sets up the anticipation for the inevitable merge of those three perspectives when you realize two characters are looking for the same things and the thirds vengeful path leads to where that thing is the sounds the music the typical fallout dark humour the stunning visuals down to the casting choice for an actor whose smile and demeanour remind you so much of the vault infomercialsnot to mention walton goggins character that really helps connect the present state of things with the past that led to it i thought hed carry the show alone but ella purnell really does a great job at embodying the first time player that gets out of the vault for a main quest and gets lost in side quests and gradually becomes more badass while aaron motens performance made me think he should be the new actor for mcus kangnothing to add but superb a show that can stand on its own as a triple a even if it werent being lifted by the fame of the game its adapting while simultaneously providing a completely novel plot beyond the ones from the game franchise its probably one of the best post apocalyptic tv shows made recently alongside silo
i thought the excellent the last of us was the best onscreen videogame adaptation so far and it was until now fallout is similarly well realised with great attention to detail very well acted by a great cast and a budget to do it justice where i give it a slight edge over tlou is purely down to it being an original story albeit set within the fallout world while tlou was a brilliantly faithful retelling of the games story this had much more tension for viewers not knowing where it was going i assume this will be renewed for more seasons as this is top quality a tip of the hat to all involved
i didnt play the fallout game although i briefly played the mini game on my phone and im so excited for this show my husband and i binged the entire season this weekend and im so sad it ended i do love anything in the post apocalyptic style  dystopian thrillers and this show is it the acting is top notch interestingunique storyline and the sets  costumes are great i think this has the potential to be a huge hit it makes me want to start halo now as a non video gamer these shows plus last of us are hits even amongst the non gamer im super looking forward to the next seasoni could see so many ways the show could possibly go i cant wait for more
started the series out of boredom with lower expectations than you can imagine but am genuinely impressed by the show in all aspects ive loved the games since a kid but purely for gameplayaesthetics so above all else i was surprised how great the storytelling of it all is nuance and depth are actually used in how they present the many factions in universe and not even in some bland centrist way either my only criticism is the egregious levels of fan service at times but at least its usually subtle so not too obnoxious the political themes from the games are even well presented always felt like some subtly is missed by many fans but its all in your face here
what a show it had everything the story slowly clicks into place and you want no need to know more this serie had my full attention something not many series seem to achieve since i have my mobile phone to distract me i love how the world is built i love how the characters dont play the cliche ohhh you lied to me now we cant be friends lines it was a journey a great one and i long for more seems to be that series inspired by or made from videogames are a new wellgoing trendi defintately would reccomend it it makes you think how much power the people who rule us really have and how much power money actually has
as a life long fan of fallout i was hesitant to show any excitement for this series watching my favorite works of tolkien get completely butchered by prime with the show we do not name my hopes were not high however within the first  minutes of episode  i was hooked and so gratefully surprised every single episode had me glued i love all the references you do not have to know anything about the games to get into this show those that have played the games will love all the nods and subtle to blatant references and appreciate all the effort that truly went into the creation of this the only thing im upset about is that i have to wait til  for season 
unfortunately even after the eighth episode i was still not fully into the seriestheres something wrong with this series im unsure if its this weird feeling of the cheap environnement the way its recorded how the characters seem so detached from around them lack of logic they had an enormous budget to film this series and i think its part of the problemcheap environnement i think we can agree how some cgi some landscape and some vfx are poorly made gun shot cooper makeupghoul skin looks so bad ts dont even look solidthere is no interaction or chemistry between the characters and their environment lucy getting out of the vault and not even impress by everything new around herlack of logic there were so many scenes where everything mades absolutely no sense  lucy getting her finger cuts without even screaming selling lucy to a huge organisation for vials when in fact its only run by  stoned guys or  idiots hard to tell cooper getting a huge load of vial and we dont see them anymore the rest of the showoh and can we talk about the brotherhood looks like every of their recruits are some dumbass with no education first or second episode how in hell maximum cant even recognize an electric circuitoh and can we talk about the siggi wilzig story line poor background story we dont know much about him theres a massive alert in his factory and no one is checking for him during the alarm and after he then magically managed to escape by walking out of the factory and dodged  bullets from the turretand so much moretldr everything feels off but the plot is decent
do hope this series will get another season i never play the game but do know bout bits and pieces of the lore thank you video essay and this series is very entertaining and well donethe story is engaging simple and yet amazingly well put the violence is very violent over the top lots of gruesome stuffs that made me look away from the screen or just cringe but like it fits the wasteland and the situation they are intheres only an editing error or like splicing  that doesnt make sense and put me out of the story but other than that i enjoyed every minute of it kinda sad that the s is finish and who knows when the next season will be outi like the characters lucy is very nice as a protagonist she started as someone who is quite naive because of her upbringing to become a survivor without truly losing herselfi love the ghoul character though it reminded me so much of that character in westworldi also love the musics and the retro s aesthethic contrasted with apocalypse always something i enjoyed to see from the fallout gamesalso big shout to the best girl the doggo cx  dogmeat you are amazing
what a pleasant surprise i dont think ive seen a videogame adaptation that just gets the source material like this one the tone the world the characters this isnt just a show based on fallout this is fallout the writing however can be hit or miss the show definitely sticks closer to bethesdas style of writing with its reliance on flashy highconcept setpieces with little depth to them it makes the show enjoyable if a bit repetitive but ultimately a bit shallow it also does that annoying thing a lot of bad shows do where theres no sense of geography and the characters just sort of teleport to wherever they need to be the third episode is undeniably the shows lowest point as the show briefly turns into an unfunny sitcom where nothing happens i wish we could see more of hank in the beginning to see what kind of person he is the characters in general feel somewhat underdeveloped which is disappointing given how much the show focuses on them lucys arc is sweet even though she comes across as a bit too childish at times the ghoul is charismatic as hell and watching his transformation from an idealist who believes in the american dream into a bitter and cynical nihilist is fascinating maximus is a great character to represent the brotherhood because of how much he doesnt fit their ideals hes a sociopath but instead of being a calculating manipulator hes an incompetent buffoon whos bad at pretty much everything he does what a fascinating character ther whole thing feels a bit like a hyperviolent saturday morning cartoon the show however has plenty of great moments such as the whole vault  subplot which nicely subverts your expectations feels like a sidequest in new vegas in the second half after a couple of filler episodes the show finally decides to become good again and the ending is just firing on all cilinders the snake oil salesman might be one of my favorite background characters ever cant wait for season 
maybe its for those that enjoyed the game but so many elements in this require massive suspension of belief that its impossible to not cringeworld got destroyed in an alternate s and we are  not  but  years in the future some people survive in underground vaults and our protagonist is about to go on an adventure to the surfacehas it been  years or are we in present day detroit no imagination when it comes to any of the designs we have tires and trash laying around just about every scene has a tire laying in the background makeshift buildings people engaging in cannibalism to survive clean concrete roads from before yet we also have advanced robotics and technology in the hands of people wearing rags so people cant figure out sewing food clothing and shelter is basic survival that people would figure out or go extinct roads get fully covered in dirt in  yearsthe story does the old trick of keeping us guessing to make the viewer watch more episode instead of being invested in the character succeeding on her quest we are invested to find out whats it all about plus our heroine and side heroes just happen to stumble upon that one thing they need whenever they need it over and over and over againthe actors do a good job and are the only thing that bring any life to this
i was expecting a typical lame series loosely based on the game but i was surprised its just a really good series even if you havent played the games to be clear you dont have to be an f fan to like this but ask your f friends about some of the background info but if you have played them you will be pleasantly surprised there is a lot of accurate game candy in it so many incidental bits from the games the little details like the random foods even a totally accurate power armor rack this is a story that isnt in any of the games but thats not a problem it fits the universe just fine one small bit i found somewhat strange the  interconnected vaults all the vaults were independent in the games but its not that big of a stretch and it is needed for the particular plot i think what the overwhelming positive response to this really means is that bethesda totally blew it abandoning what is arguably the top video game series ever done f was a disaster starfield a total mess maybe they will find their way again and come out with a new game that really fits the fallout universe hint  dont try to throw in every concept you ever heard of but with a lame storyline starfield if you cant figure that out looking forward to the next season and yes i binged all  episodes in  days not sure why az chose to release them all at once but thanks otoh im already in withdrawal now if they would just add cait in power armor life would be great
"played most of the gamesi though they rushed the beginning a bit couldve build up the start of the shows premises way moreand i had some difficulties getting into certain characters like maximus
but from episodes  things started getting better and to me it just kept rising until the last episode which really made me truly happyso many game references and without it distracting from the story perfectly implementedbeautiful music straight out of the gamesmade the world of the games truly come to life seeing familiar stuff in every scenevery much recommended just the first episodes could be a bit of a slog imo"
huge fallout fan and this show does a pretty good job world building and putting its own spin on things walton goggins is awesome as you would expect but doesnt get enough screen time they waste so much time and effort on the most unlikeable idiotic abysmally inept little sook maximus everything he does is annoying and ridiculously frustrating easily the worst character ever put on screen the guy cant act either which makes it even more intolerable the best thing for the show would be to write him out immediately and replace him with an actual lead lucy is okay but could benefit from some better writing to expand her acting range excited for season  provided they write out that moron maximus
first off bravo to everyone who worked on the show from show runners to script writers all the way to actors and producers and the costume department literally everyonethis show is amazing it has beat expectations or if anything surpassed it by light years when i finished season  i was left wanting more way more most video game adaptations leave you in a state of okay till next season i guess or sometimes even doing so terrible you dont even care to watch the next season but this this is so wildly good its the best video game adaptation ive ever seen it leaves me to wonder why people would rate this lower than an the writing is literally that best i have seen the actors are amazing some even playing the fallout games so they know what they are in for everything was perfect it was like playing a new fallout game
well cast and written stellar performances from the core cast gets the tone and art style of the games almost perfect very good and watchable for fans and casuals alike some potential but fixable with a season  or future game game continuity problems weird choice of arm rockets over the game beloved jet pack and slightly rough deaging in one scene are the minor points that just hold the show back from perfection really does put almost all other video game adaptations to shame if this level of quality is maintained i really hope they make a season   from both me game fan and my partner new to the franchise
its got a high production value and good visuals and some of the main actors are decent but there are so many things not to like the script is terrible the characters are one dimensional and over the top the action sequences are worse than a bad s tv series the gore is like the rubber era of the s too too much and like the rubber era kind of like robocop  and total recall but dumberthe characters and settings look like a kids show but with all the gore and dark setting it doesnt make any senseon top of all that theres a lack of chemistry among the cast the actors do their thing but they have to explicitly tell you how they feel all the timei guess amazon prime likes to make garbage content it couldve been great if joynolan made it like the first season of westworld but it looks like they were told to dumb it way down
the pluses are of course the lead actors walton goggins adding depth and detail to a relatively simplistic cowboy role adding menace and meaning all the way somewhat constricted by a large amount of effects makeupella purnell stepped up her already solid game from a good performance in miss peregrines home for peculiar children and a series of not that great other projects shes great in this thoughi hadnt noticed aaron moten before although he was in the terrible emancipation movie hes great in this i really liked his fumbling and mumbling delivery it seemed natural and realthe world design was great the future as we saw it from the s and s one that was never delivered but seemed so much more funthe downside was the over the top gore which im sure plays out well on a video game but in this story it seemed gratuitous the finger cutting off thing in this world you can pull a dead finger and graft it onto your stump and youre fine but did we have that tech in the s or even now nope so it comes across as brutal gratuitous and unbelievable which is saying something in this work or already stretch fiction world i get that it was a bit but it wasnt that great and maybe it was just the way it was done what are supposed to do with this scene etc how are we supposed to feel when a ghoul chops off a girls finger right in front of her face for what reason its cheesy overused shock valuethe brutality was unnecessary but i guess weve come to expect this of people like jonathan nolan the first series of westworld was likewise brutal but seemed to be saying something but the next  series said nothing of worththere was a bunch of touch stone political ideas thrown in but it did seem a bit piecemeal one of the political concepts they threw in almost made me laugh as the character delivered it pretty much like reading a meme off social media there might be some insight on offer but it didnt come across well and didnt seem that insightful but what do we expect its based on a video game and they seem to have purposefully kept that clunky aspect in this series pick up the jewel to get the reward youve got bonus power etc etc i think they thought it was clever and paying respect to the game it was based on but im here devoting my time to this program and clunky just doesnt cut itso hence my average response to this i loved walton goggins watching him act is a reward in itself but it could have been so much better if the dumped the gore filtered out the game play stuff and really focused the vision of the world so it said something instead of a mish mash of rhetoric thrown in a blender theres probably something decent in there but its hard to filter it out with all the noise
ive played a few of the games this is based on and figured this production would go one of two ways thankfully it went wellfirstly for fans of the game its easter egg galore and very faithful to what i know of the game series the series focuses on a handful of core characters with some worthy supporting roles for secondary characters which also feels very inkeeping with the game as too is the violence a lot of violence which may be offputting for somethe plot is gamelevel generic with some predictable twists and turns but it works really well in this format its not a preachy story with bad attempts at political commentary or subtext  its a straightup postapocolyptic survival story where few people are good or bad but a blur of both as they struggle to survive in a ruined wastelandi recommend it to fans of the game and to people who broadly like the genre
fallout is one of the best video game adaptations to exist however some of the acting and writing in the show takes you out of the feel of the show that it strives greatly to achieve i felt the writing around maximuss character was sub par compared to the rest of the show his acting also felt very shoehorned all this to say the show is great and had perfect vibes one would expect from a fallout adaptation ella purnel was a huge standout and highlight of the show her acting was great along with being the only character who felt like a real person other than walter goggins most characters felt very onedimensional and barely had a character at all ella purnel and walter goggins made up for this however
i didnt play the games so came into this not knowing any of the lore etc that all the  gamer reviewers seem to havewhile the visuals and production are amazing and give a real sense of the world setting im left wondering what was the point of it all admittedly i never finished watching the full season i got to ep and realised that i didnt care about any of the characters and stopped there maybe more depth will come with the second season but i wont be watching it to find outi get that itll appeal to those familiar with the franchise but i feel like for the majority that watch not knowing much of the background itll come across as tedious to watch
i havent played the games and after few episodes i started to wonder this looks somewhat similar to silo  tv series and since the first game came out in s did that show borrow ideas from the game but then reading some trivia found out this shows story and plot is completely different than the games others than characters setting and perhaps few references here and theregreat series enjoyed the characters and despite being very heavy emotional typical dark dystopian future for humanity it had its moments of mild humor tooone secret i really would like to find out is how to stay and look in pristine condition while mostly walking around for miles in a wasteland filled with deserts and radiation affected plant life lucy one of the lead female character had zero marks anywhere on her face her uniform always stayed in mint condition and even her hair were not only neatly tied up all the time but stayed shiny as if she just had her hair done by a professional the only little mark shown on her face was that minor cut on her lips that happened during one of the action sequencesi would love to know the secret of staying like that it must be some sort of magic in future right it simply cant be a hollywood magic
my wife and i finally finished fallout  on prime the storyline follows a postapocalyptic world where a nuclear bomb has destroyed civilization the surface is plagued by radiation while some survivors live in commercial bunkers underground when a bunker community is invaded and its leader kidnapped his daughter offers to leave the bunker to find and rescue him shes in for a rude awakening as she discovers just how different the world is from her bunkerthis series was cocreated by geneva robertsondworet captain marvel and graham wagner silicon valley and stars ella purnell yellowjackets walton goggins the hateful eight aaron moten emancipation and leslie uggams deadpoolthe special effects attire soundtrack and backdrops brilliantly pull you into the universe and storyline keeping you locked in the series weaves multiple storylines that intersect and collide by the end interestingly the main character is the hardest to root for while the characters around her are the most fascinating the subplots are welldeveloped and smart and the circumstances feel realistic my favorite episode featured the organ donor robot sequence and the drug maker concluding shootout the michael rapaport episode and the foot sequence were also excellent the final war for the head was a great climax effectively closing out plot lines and setting up new ones for season in conclusion fallout is the perfect blend of science fiction and horror with a massive universe that sucks you in like game of thrones this is a new classic that i would score a  and strongly recommend

fallout was my most anticipated series of this year and im happy to say it did not disappointfirst of all it looks spectacular they absolutely nailed the look and aesthetic of the fallout universe and its reliance on more practical effects rather than overusing cgi like most modern series really showedthe cast was very good ella purnell was a charismatic lead and it goes without saying but you cant go wrong with walton gogginsthe story was very well written making the show part of the same continuity of the games without adapting any game in particular i think was a good choice it truly felt like the writers respected the source material which unfortunately is a very rare trait in video game adaptationsfollowing on from the success of the last of us fallout makes me look forward to the future of video game adaptations and very excited for the mass effect and god of war series amazon prime currently have in development as it is clear that they can make a tv series based on a popular video game series truly incredible  amazing
this captures so much that i expected from a fallout show the set design costumes makeup storylines npcs all bring this show to life so engaging wonderful twists and turns and it felt like you were behind the wheel taking in the choices and seeing how our heroine lucy decided to lead her path it was incredible to watch a show that had to have been the cost of a full length cinematic film the sheer amount of details they weaved told the story so well but left a ton of easter eggs for the die hard gamers to enjoy rock solid casting from the main characters to the oneoffs i had a blast watching it and i cannot wait for another season
 fallout is a fun series that definitely gets better in later episodes episode  is what did it for me the overall design and scenery is immaculate and seriously astoundingly well made a lot of scenes seem to be filmed in actual locations which is a big plus as well overall the story is engaging and the acting is greatunfortunately there are many scenes that happen clearly because the writers need them to happen at that point with the only guiding force being happenstancesmn listens in at exactly the right time to hear exactly what the audience needs to hear smthn is discovered only because it needs to be discouvered no matter how likely it is every main character is basically on the same path because it needs to be that way it felt quite forced and almost rushed at times which unfortunately reduces the quality of the show overall for methat said the fact that i still gave it an  should tell you that all the rest is very well done and well worth a watch i hope future seasons can do away with so many random teammeetings and perfect timings to ground it a little more in a  for me
this had a lot of nostalgic elements from the games its music and set im sure a lot of gamers like me would appreciate many parts of the world come to life the main character is alright shes full of pep and enthusiasm that would fit a vault dweller but the ghoul is the main highlight of the show he very quickly steals everyone elses attention feels like the first few episodes of the mandalorianmaximus however had so much inconsistencies and later on he acts as if hes written by two different people many parts of the series portrays him as very weak then later on acts like an experienced wastelander then another episode of him acting all weak and stupid again his inconsistencies like his disappearing branding and all of a sudden his idiocy was contagious enough to even affect the main character  who was naive the first parts of the series then experienced then suddenly back to being silly again perhaps the writers had rad poisoning he is basically like star wars finn boring uninteresting i even had to google for the correct spelling of his name thats how memorable he waslove interests in the entire series had no chemistry no love and all business remove that and it wont affect the story at allthe season ending was kind of everything id expect the series to end but a bit flat there was chaos but i sense no excitement at all even with the ghoul appearing overall id give this a  its the ghoul that saved this series to be honest id watch season  if its just him
whether youre a fan of the games cant stand the games or know absolutely nothing about the games this show is a hit captivating funny doesnt hold back the costumes the sets all of it is incredible i am disappointed that the season is only  episodes long by the end i was debating picking up one of the games and playing it ive disliked every bethesda game ive ever played and would never have considered it had the show not been as good as it is i wasnt necessarily a fan of the lead male character his acting was great but something was really missing there warning the show is violent
ive played fallout  new vegas and gave up completing fallout  so im familiar with the universe but not a diehard fan of the franchiseon the whole i enjoyed the show it does a great job of presenting the world i know from the video games capturing the tone the art style and even some of the humor that made the games such a great experience theres an atmosphere to the show that is instantly recognizable to any gamer who spent time in the wasteland special effects are quite good and theres a density to the set design and props that makes the world feel more real and lived inacting ranges from decent to excellent ella purnell and walton goggins stand out and are able to overcome some fairly campy dialogue to deliver performances that are both memorable and fun to watchunfortunately i feel like the show stumbles with telling a compelling story there are several instances where the plot develops a little too conveniently characters just happen across each other at the exact right time and place for the story to progress with no explanation given there are also a couple of writing choices where my suspension of disbelief went right out the window most importantly when i finished episode  i still didnt have any idea of what the story was really about what point were they trying to get across why did they make this show in the first place as with most new media these days it felt a little like they wanted to make a show around a familiar franchise and then hired some writers to accomplish that rather than starting off with a burning desire to tell a fallout storyall in all its an entertaining watch but its not a  out of  experience as many here seem to suggest if you moderate your expectations storywise youll have a good time with fallout
im a huge fallout fan and i was wondering what a big company like amazon didwhen i watched all  episodes i realized that i was brutally cheated and the funny thing is that i didnt even pay for a subscription the series is so disappointing to melets start with the visual aspect the visuals are horrible and only  of the content is similar to what was in the game where are the same twoheaded cows the super mutants the death claw its all crumpled and im surprised the set designers didnt even open up a map to at least  of the fallout series the cities in the series look boring and poorly designed onestory buildings even if its a large city are no different from a settlement many people will say that the series departs from the adaptation of the game but i have a question why was to use the basic design and the game why these posters and other visuals from the game to deceive fans i correctly understood not a bad movethe space is visually poorly designed how can it be that a knights assistant stops at the red rocket has vegetation around him and  minutes later in the next episode of the same series finds himself in the desert how does that workroads are another problem the asphalt in major cities especially near the nuclear sinkhole is flat and smooth cars are parked not overturned not dismantled it looks absurdblooperswhen cowboy cowboy gul came to give lucy to the robot mr helper for some reason the store stands whole and unharmed only powdered with dust but  meters away the buildings are blown to rubble how is that even possiblein one of the episodes when lucy is kicked out of the bunker by the sectarians a soldier steals a nuclear battery in the next shot he shows up in his armor but no one noticed that he threw the armor under the bridgesome might say that the armor was in the bunker but the funny thing is that it was the same power armor that the soldier left under the bridge difference claw marks on the power armor from the bear how was he able to come back in such a short period of time with the armor already on how did he get out of the bunker how did he enter the bunkerdialogues theyre as stupid as possible in one of the episodes lucy and a soldier come to the crater which was left after the atomic explosion lucy asks the soldier i wonder if anyone is still alivein short i concluded that we fallout fans have been duped and amazon signed a contract not with professional directors but with yearold children
fallout is a triumph in television storytelling flawlessly translating the beloved video game franchise into an epic smallscreen experience from its breathtaking worldbuilding to its deeply compelling characters every aspect of the show is crafted with meticulous attention to detail fans of the games will delight in the faithful adaptation of the iconic postapocalyptic setting while newcomers will be drawn in by the rich narrative and immersive atmosphere with its stellar cast masterful direction and gripping plot twists fallout raises the bar for what television can achieve its not just a showits a journey into a world like no other where every moment is infused with tension excitement and profound emotional resonance
i enjoyed the show a lot as a fan of game series but the plot has incredible inconsistencies not related to games just bad setups that i doubt will hold up on second viewingi still consider the show massive success and cant wait for second season but i hope following issues wont repeat in following seasonthe show has major issue with writing most of the major conflictssituations are setup in a completely nonsensical way just to create drama when upon resolving it you find the whole setup does not make sense at all in regards to characters motivations ie initial setup makes sense upon first viewing not knowing all information but once you understand who the characters are and their motivations the initial setup makes absolutely no sense and is not something that the characters would ever do writers essentially need to create drama and violence in this show while also having characters who sometimes turn out good but the writing is somewhat poor so the way they do it is to render the characters badevil and then resolve it as hey we are the good guys actually which falls apart because the whole initial conflict could be resolved with  minute talk which they cant have because then none of it would make any sensespoilers right at start the whole setup with raiders coming in and brutalizing everyone makes absolutely no sense upon finishing the season moldaver as the villain was clearly not a villain and while as everyone in wasteland is perfectly fine with violence that whole massacre makes zero sense why did she not say what the overseer did did she not know everyone else in the vault is clearly innocent before massacring everyone they could have you know talk or hold them captives and get only the overseer for the code they needed but no the show needed to create villain and get some violence in so at start they created characters that were brutal and barbaric which then absolutely does not hold up that was not justified violence to have a revenge after shady sands that was just plain massacre to give motivation to lucy and have over the top violence at start moldaver was clearly extremely smart character as we find out during the season yet at start her actions are irrationally brutal and she has zero ability to communicate to the people she is about to massacre why i will tell you why because show runners wanted to create evil mysterious character who we will slowly find out she actually is and has supposed depth but that does not work when that character actually behaves like a brutal idiot who cant tell innocent people that the guy who was their leader literally nuked the surface but later on we are supposed to buy she is reasonable person who has altruistic motives in heart if the story and characters acted reasonably and not like idiots there was no reveal at the end whole vault would be told what happened right at the start ie its fake drama that is not believable because characters dont act in a believable way true to who they are supposed to be at one of the early episodes we see goggins fight t operated by maximus who does not even have a training and its a pretty long fight where goggins struggles ie its early on and t has to still be established as a super weapon then magically at last episode goggins remembers t have build flaw and can be essentially taken down by one shot  sure literal walking tank have armor flaw on the chest armor whatever i am not going to even talk about that  anyways writers dot this because they failed to create any better resolution to the whole fight at the end so they bring goggins in with his magic bullet trick to take down army of ts because now he remembered he can do that i am sorry but thats just awful and made the whole resolution of the final fight a complete joke to me the whole section with vault with mutated inhabitants who were actually nice was equally stupid again it was mostly fun but the entire premise is stupid they could literally tell them at begging hey some of us were experimented on way back and thats why we have these mutations dont go to level  please there is some stuff from that time but again writers needed to create drama so while the characters are actually nice they make them act whole time shady and suspicious so that the main character thinks there is something wrong and audience thinks something is wrong as well but there is not its just writers gaslighting audience with actions that make no sense for the actually nice characters as in point  whole situation would be resolved in a roughly  minute chat but they are not allowed to do that because none of the motivations and actions of those characters would hold up the whole gaslighting of main characters and audience to think they bring in people just to experiment on them was just gaslighting there is actual reason why they did have the mutations which they could easily explain to them they do anyway in the end but that would make too much sense early on and then we dont have episode perhaps having characters who can behave consistently at start of the episode and its end would be betteranyways i realy like the show there were many good things about it mentioned by others in it to compensate all the inconsistencies but i hope the next season can do without these
"before i start this review i have to say that i have never played a fallout game though i know the basic premise so i wont be judging my opinion of the show based on any of the games though i have now finished watching the fallout tv show and here is my review for it the premise of the show sees a post apocalypse world after a nuclear war which sees people living in vaults underground to avoid the dangers of the surfacemain character
ella purnell plays lucy mclean and she is fantastic in this show her character has a fantastic character development throughout and i just think she played up the role really well she was a likeable character and somebody who was easy to root for in this show there is a naivety to her as she interacts with other characters but it can come across as charming and gives her a way to developsupporting characters
aaron moten plays maximus and he is decent in his role it personally took me longer to care about his character then the others and i just think moten didnt convey much emotion or reason to care about him but that does mostly change midway through the show and moten starts to grow into the role and add some more personalitywalton goggins plays cooper howardthe ghoul and he is tremendous in both versions of his character we see goggins as cooper in his prime before the nuclear war and it is interesting to see especially compared to his undead bounty hunter persona in the modern day story he is very charismatic and the fact that he has all this story about him does make him the most interesting part of the show and goggins smashes itmoises arias plays norm mclean and he is very good in the show and gets given his own story arc which is actually important for the overall show he is mostly separate from the other main characters but he does an effective job and i grew to like his character more after the first episodethis has a big cast that have smaller roles here and they are all great this world is full of lively people and it feels like a vibrant world because of their performances whether they be on the surface or in the vaults it was really effectivestory
the story is great as i said i have no idea about the fallout story in the games but i became really invested in this shows plot and interested throughout we see stories both on the wasteland and in the vaults and both are pretty captivating and do a good job of developing the characters the flashbacks are good as well and are used effectively to give more context for the storytellingscript
the show is well written it has moments of comedy in there but also plenty of dramatic moments that made me care there are many twists and intrigue here and i think the writing did an effective job of showing thisstyle
amazon clearly had high hopes for fallout as you can see the massive budget used and the show looks fantastic both the wasteland and vaults look so unique and fully encapsulate the tone of the show though i think there were some issues mainly the overuse of slowmo in action scenes i think slowmo is a tool that can be used effectively but it has to be used carefully and this show definitely overuses it i also know that country music is heavily involved with the games and it is well treated here but again it is just overused especially during some of the action scenes that didnt require itoverall
overall the first season of fallout was fantastic it made me super interested in this universe and hyped for a potential second season even if you havent played any of the games this is still a show that should be watched because i think you will really enjoy itrating  "
if youre a vault dweller like me you will have played fallout since it first came out as an rpg back in the s a sprawling and somewhat overwhelming game with a rich world and fantastic charactersit is the gem in bethesdas cataloguewith other games receiving the hollywood treatment it was only time before someone took this on enter johnathon nolanif you arent a fan i would suggest you search for a short introduction to the world of fallout but it can be hard to follow with such a soup of themes and storiesthis is well worth a watch nonetheless it has nolanesque tropes and plays with time and themeit can be a little hard to follow and the action is taut and straight out of the playbook fallout has enough references and thematic callbacks that it is hard not to likethe characters are written well the dialogue is good the story is true to the lore of fallout and the set is particularly rewardingwalter goggins is a fantastic actor and he carries a lot of the charm on his shoulders as for the rest of the cast they each perform their pieces with plumthe music cgi and sound design are all of a fine standard and despite amazons many fails this could very well be a hit just as long as they dont drag it out and go meme hunting like rings of powerif there is any criticism it would be that there could have been more of a callback to vats and the gaming element this does not detract however as it is important to know that this is a serial and not a gamegive it a go and make your own mind up however it is hard to not like this show for the characters collective journeys
i watched this show and thoroughly enjoyed it with no prior knowledge of the games or lorei recently played and finished new vegas and fallout  then followed with rewatching the showi had low expectations on the second watch as adaptations usually do not stay true to the lore and disappoint rings of power halo could name more but i was very wrong they incorporated numerous easter eggs and the same feel of the games while they could have done a better job writing the villains to be in the grey area as seen in the games they still did a fantastic job with the soundtrack costumes and mysteriousnessthe actress for lucy plays her role great and is not written as a mary sue who knows everything im talking to you disney and walton goggins gives a memorable performance as the ghoulthe show ends on a great cliffhanger on what is in store for season  and also leaves enough questions in every plot line to leave the viewer wanting more looking forward to whats in store
dont listen to the fanboy gatekeepers this show wasnt perfect but it was awesome and i expected far worseanybody with a brain knows it takes more than  episodes to have character development main character was likable without being overpowered her luck stats were just highshe wasnt a mary sue she was the main character the player character she starts off in basically a brainwashing cult of course shes going to be naive she grows and becomes more real and remember its only the first season it takes time for people to change and break old habitsand god forbid a female actually have a sexual side without being criticized for it i dont think it was necessary but it was hardly interfering with the plot i wasnt a fan of the romance aspect but thats finethat being said max was awful i kept rooting for him to die i dont want redemption they started his characters development far too late and hes a psychopathand of course everybodys favorite cooper i could watch a whole show that just follows him around he was such a fun morally gray character who was an over the top badass in the best ways and i cant wait to see what they have in store for him give me the  years of backstory in a spinoff pleaselots of fun little easter eggs and nods to the show and actually having matt berry show up was amazing
"i dont even know where to begin the fact that it has an  rating blows my mind
obviously im assuming they were voted by people who never played the game the wasteland is weak enclave is weak death claws are pretty cool ill give them that but life in the wasteland doesnt translate from the game to the show at all  i feel like if they were going to change so much they shouldnt have tried to follow the story line just make a new path instead of watching i would suggest just redownloading the game if you dont still have it and just replaying it because you will have a far better experience in conclusion this show is hurting me on the inside and im sad that i waited so long to watch it "
as my title suggest this is a bit of a mixed bag for me ive played fallout for god knows how many times and absolutely love that game to pieces since then ive played new vegas and fallout three but the less we say about  the better for me the fallout tv such a show was a great opportunity and a lot of fun its best enjoyed if you turn off your brain and just have a good time with it and dont think too hard about the story unfortunately as soon as you do think about the story you realise all the writing mistakes and plot errors and plot holes for that matter that start creep in the show runners did a fantastic job bringing the wasteland to life and there are so many odds to the games that its unreal unfortunately the end of the series just feels quite rushed and like i say the plot and the character motivations start to fall apart as soon as as you really think about them the other thing that also irritates me is the number of conveniences within the story things just seem to happen at the right point and had it been for a few seconds either way these things wouldnt have happened i appreciate that modern tv but it is annoying this was a good show but it couldve been a great show  a little bit like westworld in that way series  is guaranteed but i have a feeling they will quickly lose his energy after series  in the same way that westworld did
wow this is actually really goodi have to start my review by saying i never played the game so i entered with zero expectations so im telling you when i binged this entire thing my mind was blown away this is wonderfully done shot written and directedfirst episode if youre like me unaware of the game wouldnt make a lot of sense but when you go further youll get attached to each character and the story itself about the story ive watched dozens of apocalyptic works and even games not so much time ago the show silo nearly had thhe same idea but surely different potentials what i found interesting in fallout is the philosophy about the apocalyptic world theyre living in how in an a capitalist society we well always end up like this and the motivation behind each character to still live this awful life and their narratives is what singled out fallout for me
i wanted to give this series a much lower rating but the overall production quality garners a few stars more walton goggins helps the rating as well however you can tell this is a bethesda take on the ip and thats not a good thing its too clean too playful fallout is gritty and raw the gory scenes in this even seem out of place which is odd considering its in the fallout universeeveryone seems to be praising the effects teams and the majority of it is well done but im a bit disappointed in the bos power armor for something that is not cgi it looks like bad cgi not sure how that happensif you only like fallout  and fallout  youll probably like this if you like fallout   and new vegas youll probably just feel obligated to watch this if you dont know what im talking about well ignorance is bliss im just surprised there wasnt micro transactions all along the way
an obvious product of handing it to multiple writers and directors and making it up as they went drastic tonal inconsistency between episodes and plots that take nonsense turns just to somehow justify how some character knows which way to go the whole thing was improved for me significantly by skipping over all the brotherhood of steel stuff though because in the games i always found them obnoxious and sanctimonious and thats sure on point here and maximus is not a good person i dont care how much they try to say it in the plot enjoy him never not seeming like a whiny little boy ever i honestly hate that characters guts
amazon shows us that whenever they take things seriously they get the job done masterfully every episode is intriguing every character the acting is superb you never feel any sign of monotony during your watch youre always anxious waiting patiently and curious for whats coming next and they always surprise you with more and more insanity also i believe with the boys peacemaker and this getting so much awareness we can safely say placing the  tag on a movieseries is the best way to go it allows the creators to capture reality at its peak all the violence and gore so well done just go and watch it trust me its amazing
fallout is a gripping masterpiece that delivers on every level set in a postapocalyptic world this tv series expertly weaves together compelling storytelling intricate character development and breathtaking visuals from the first episode to the last youll find yourself completely immersed in the richly detailed universe and the struggles of its inhabitants with its clever blend of suspense action and thoughtprovoking themes fallout is a mustwatch for any fan of dystopian dramas prepare to be hooked from start to finish  without a doubtif you loved the games you will love this show for sure
its a great series especially with so many game to show or movie adaptations being so off the mark also knowing  guy had directional help with the series makes since i hope that the series stays with the same integrity i enjoyed this very much and am looking forward to the next season i think the layout of the armor for the knights was fantastic the use of miniatures to film was spectacular and the characters was spot on i love the opening cinematics with the bombs going off i am impressed with the camera angles and the wardrobe honestly the wardrobe department was amazing the show feels very organic and a tribute to the game series
ive been playing fallout games for as long as ive been alive from fallout new vegas on the xbox  to fallout  on my pc which is why i can confidently say this show does not disappoint its fun and funny but also serious all the effects and props look great for a show and im happy there is more then enough content to keep me going with saying this i hope they make a season two and if they do i hope its just as charming at this season but for some people this show might feel slow at the start with the vault scenes or even boring or drawn out and to those people i say keep going its worth it in the end
the fallout tv show is exceptional in every regard fantastic casting with memorable performances from every character kyle mclachlan lynchs constant muse is used sparingly but his charisma makes every appearance entertaining the wild west swagger of walton goggins terrifies  delights as the ghoulcooper howard ella parnell plays protagonist lucy with a wide eyed innocence that turns to steely determination a mindset echoed by most players as the begin the first gaming experience of falloutthe mise en scène is filled with so many tiny details referencing brands items weapons  so much more which makes the environments feel real  is a fun way to pop the fans of the franchisethe intriguing plot drives the whole endeavour forward with genuine mystery thatll have you binging the series like youve got uranium fever
i dont really write reviews im a lurker but i grew up with fallout and i have somewhat dreaded what this series could end up being i did not like fallout  i ignored fallout  but i shall speak my piece for those who care to partakefirst i have some issues with the presentation visually it feels quite plastic there are parts that feel so cgi that it grinds my gears secondly some character choices seem convenient rather than logical thirdly i would have liked further development of somebut in the end i surrender they did this the way it should be done this show does fallout in a way that games as a medium should not they actually made a show that added to the universe in a pleasant way im not here to spoil anything so i wont elaborate further but if you like the games and were talking  to new vegas you should se this at least you should know that you neednt woory about doing soyeah its the bomband i had a blast
far and away the best part of this part series is the first  minutes of episode  but as realistic as they attempted to make the nuclear blasts seem they still got that all wrong and it was all downhill from there i kept waiting for an intriguing plotline to develop from the several parallel stories presented but no such luck alot of the set design on the surface had the feel of a low budget mad max film and the scenes inside the vault played like big budget mstk episode walton goggins provided the only character of any discernable depth and frankly provided the only dialogue in the whole eightpart series that was worth a damn the rest of the characters were pretty much idiots i can see from the other reviews that the series was a somewhat faithful adaptation of the video game but that just tells me we need to stop using video games as source material for films and tv 
not that im a professional reviewer or anything i just like good tv shows and movies and can usually find a small thing or two that i dont like about themfor fallout ive got nothing it really is a masterpiece i never played the fallout games either so im not fanboying or having nostalgia here but after watching the show i can see why people loved the gamesive already read some articles and watched some youtube videos about fallout lore because im hooked on this atomicpunk setting  scenario what a cool concept where nuclear energy develops faster than things like tvs and appliances and a nuclear war actually happens and now theyre living in the aftermath i could read about it for hourseven standing alone from the preexisting lore and knowledge that they were working with from the games the show is really well done the acting was top notch walton goggins and ella purnell were fantastic the story is super interesting the show looks awesome even the end credits are pretty dope they do a great job early on of setting the two different tones between the vaults and the wasteland then have the pacing timed perfectly for giving more information about the characters the world and the ploti think you get it now this show rocks go watch itcant wait for season 
the audacity of some of you to say oh no political messages in the show such a funny show wonderful thank you youre the reason we have nothing good please rave about this show that included a genocidal freak the second ign said omg what a show so honest to the source material i shouldve known please stop ruining people lives like come on swear some of us work day in day out study day in day out i just want to watch something good for once please stop it this horrible like botttom of the barrel i hate it when they try to write bad characters like why stop it no plot no story nothing im done
its like the writers watched a playthrough of the game and took notes the characters who stood out the most from the writers perspective are the main characters in the show its like theyre trying to imitate the game without understanding the true essence of the fallout seriesa true fan perspective i tried liking the show my problem with the show is with the writing the writers have decided to take the show in a kid friendly direction the entire vibe of the fallout series is lost the main characters are a bit too silly the environment appears a bit too clean the color palette a bit too saturated its easy to tell that theyre acting on set and in front of props rather than in real rundown neighborhoods subways and walking inside of abandoned buildings not knowing what to expect around every corner etc everything that happens in the show is predictable from a mile away that sense of suspense gone therefore the sense of realism and immersion lost to the audiencethe fallout series is meant to be more in the vein of  escape from new york  the book of eli  i am legend apocalyptic suspenseful gritty etc but the writers of the show have decided to go in the direction of kid friendliness its like watching power rangers lol maybe its not the writers who is at fault here but rather the higher ups over at microsoft either way unfortunateby the way those thumbing this tv series up doesnt seem to have been fans of the fallout series i am seeing comments from causals who were never fans of the games thumbing this tv series up and thus the reason for the high ratings maybe thats the audience microsoft was aiming for
there are many things done right in this show  the casting the story the attention to the details the following of the already developed concepts and ideas take for instance one of the main characters of the show the power armor its designed to look and behave just as in the games so it has a real feel of a heavy force and slowbutlethal feel to it also seeing kyle maclachlan in it is a sheer treat  and theres many similar concepts taken as they were robotics vaults suits guns medication etcspeaking of the story it is perhaps not the most engaging one overall but at the same time its only the first season and its also engaging enoughspeaking of actors and characters i think everyones great and right where they belong in this show  i wouldnt focus the attention on anyone in particular as i think the whole ensemble is what really gets it going and a special thanks to the people who built or animated the power armour  if i were to dedicate the praise to one character thatd be itwith all the greatness theres a surprising number of goofs endless rounds in a sixshooter guns lack of lights on power armours when even pipboys have them unclear difference between some vaults etc it doesnt spoil the show but its odd given its based on video games where all these aspects are at the core of the gameplaystorytellingoverall ive enjoyed the show  its gory cooky bizzare infantile peculiar and vivid its great
for video games adapted to movies or shows i usually have extensive knowledge as i am a fan of the game itself fallout is different as i have not ever played the games this meant that this show was a unique experience for me as i was now coming in from a nonfan perspective does this show succeed in pulling in newcomersfirstly the world itself is interesting the postapocalyptic world is visually stunning thanks to the phenomenal cinematography they managed to capture a weirdly unfound beauty of the world but also contrast this with the ugly nature of human beings we see how humans on the surface survive through these towns or the cruel activities they do we also see factions such as the brotherhood who try for some order on the surface and people who become ghouls after becoming mutated by the radiation the monster designs are creepy and disgusting which is what makes them great some humans have also survived by going into vaults underground the mystery behind the vaults is a big part of this show and kept me guessing about the meaning all the time the lore in fallout is captivating but never feels like information overloadthe story also does a great job of juggling multiple character plots our central character lucy maclean who is played wonderfully by ella purnell goes to the surface to rescue her dad after their vault is attacked the premise is simple but the execution is well done the series starts as a fish out of water story for lucy but gradually becomes something different as more mysteries are uncovered we also have a story about maximus who is sent on a quest from the brotherhood to receive a man there is also the ghoul played amazingly by walton goggins who is now a gunslinger also on a quest for the same man additionally norm maclean is discovering a dark secret about their vault all these characters and different plotlines occur in the show but they managed to balance all of it out while keeping all of them engaging the writing and the dark humour are all great i love that none of the characters are one dimensional and they all have quite the depth to them lucy isnt a badass and is an overly naive idiot her growing as she spends more time in the wasteland feels natural the others also have great character arcsthe production designs of the sets are amazing it is clear that a lot of effort went into building them and being as practical as well it is also very notable that they filmed a lot on location which makes the show feel more real they could easily just use green screen or cgi for a lot of the show but they didnt and i appreciate that for example the brotherhood power armour is an actual practical suit and looks awesome the rest of the costumes are also wonderfully designed from the vault suit to the dirty look of those on the surface special praise should also come to the practical makeup of the ghouls face which honestly should win awards because it looks amazing the music score by ramin djawadi for the show is very good he uses excellent s and s songs for the right moment he also composes a nice score that doesnt feel overly distracting the score for whenever the ghoul appears is honestly terrific the violence in the show is grim and maybe a little gratuitous but it adds to the charm of the showi dont have many flaws to say about this show apart from nitpicks the second half of the show except the finale is a little weak compared to the first half we dont get any cool action sequences and the story goes on a slight side quest detour for some characters that doesnt amount to much the dialogue is also a little on the nose and a bit overly silly for the second half i also kind of wish we got to see more monsters on the wasteland we get two great monster encounters in the first half of the show but the second half just doesnt have anyoverall fallout is the next in amazing video game adaptations when you have a show written by someone who seems to respect the games and the fans you get fallout not only did they write a show that pleases fans but also one that can bring in newcomers like me i barely have any knowledge of the games yet i was thoroughly entertained by this show i cant wait for season  heck maybe i should get into the games for once
i love alternative history and fallout depicts a sinister but fun timeline in the best way possible this is now my favorite show and first the first show that got me to write a reviewthe show takes you into the fallout universe it is immersive and detailed for those that love a post apocalypse scene this is one you cannot miss costumes scenes etc are all primohowever what sets this show apart for me is its depiction of good and evil or lack there of all morality is based on instinct and is subject to change with respect to a societies environment we are all natural born killers we just dont need to kill yeti put it up there with interstellar the big lebowski and co makes me think of endless ai generated content in the future and how i wouldnt leave my house if there were endless seasons of walter goggins flashbacks
with all game adaptations you go in holding your breath and expecting the worst but this doesnt disappoint at first you can see it becoming another mundane experience this is soon proven otherwise as youre plunged into the world of fallout with gritty conflict and a complex plot my only complain is the lack of content in such a large universe of lore theyve filled a lot of it with walking and some easter eggs they have set up an enjoyable show as well as the base to continue a successful video game adaptation which makes a nice change hopefully this will have a promising future and explore more of the fallout lore and some of the niche characters
fallout is not your average tv series  its way cooler than that imagine a world where everything got messed up by nuclear bombs and people are living in underground bunkers to stay safe but when they have to come up to the surface they find a wild place full of mutants and scary people doing bad thingsthe main character lucy played by ella purcell is new to this topside world and totally unprepared for what she finds and lets not forget about walton goggins who plays this awesome mutant bandit he steals the show every time hes on screenwhats really neat about fallout is how it looks and feels just like the video game its like someone who really knows the game made a movie out of it which is pretty amazing especially in the humor the story the music  its all there making fallout a total blast to watch and lucy shes not your typical strong woman character shes cool and easy to like just like the rest of the castso if youre looking for a show thats exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat fallout is the one and hey amazon if youre listening forget about rings of power and give us more fallout instead
dont know how to put it but fallout really did take me by surprise being a big fallout fan i honestly was a bit skeptical to see how todd howard could try to not adapt the games into this story and instead go with a whole new story that goes differently than the og games or the bethesda titles but i kinda like itthe goods first the characters are actually well developed lucy out main character is quite charming and enjoyable to follow along as she tries to look for her father whom as taken from her in the vault fallout  copy she does see the world outside in a more positive outlook in life as a naïve vault dweller would but would soon see it differentlythe ghoul was another great ensemble to the characters a once tv star that has endured the  years above ground and is now a bounty hunter that is also at risk of turning feral its also great that we have flashbacks of his past before the great waranother great highlight is the story itself suffice to say it has everything a good story should have plus the humor and charm that the fallout games possess music aesthetic and of course the whole plot with the vaults like in any other fallout gamethe only thing i wouldve loved to see was more backstory on the ncr and what happened to the rest of them when shady sands was destroyed but crossing my fingers season  will tap into the new vegas lorei would say fallout is a great tv show to watch and its one thing that actually works in the minds of todd howard
fallout is depressingly dystopian of course that is as it should be its the end of the socalled civilised world strangely while its tempting to make comparisons of the world before and after the atomic apocalypse in the case of the fallout universe its more trickymalevolence just seems more overt post apocalypse otherwise perhaps its not so different perhaps preapocalypse the darkness in people just hid more effectively in the shadows later there was no need for it to be hiddenagain because fallout gamers and neophyte nongamer viewers will bring entirely different expectations to their viewer experiences the storyline has to try to accommodate both the latter viewer will probably bring an initially confused and understandably naive perspective in their viewing of vault tec curated realitiestheyre newbie viewers are likely to accept the suggestion of a utopianlike pseudo way of life within a vault fallout shelter away from apocalyptic horror and radiation hazard we learn eventually what the vaults are in truth it turns out vaults are not so benevolent in their design intent rather the idea behind their development the reason for which they were built may be something quite horrific outside and inside maynt be so differentso depending on whether youre new to the fallout universe or not viewer expectations accordingly are likely to be quite different graphic violence tribal power struggles mutated horrors and the near complete devolution of humanity all offer an unsavoury tableau of human woe and depravity this is the textured palette with which the creators have to workas a result i found myself a little disappointed the first series didnt progress further than it did story wise however the reality is many viewers are new to the concepts and ideas of the fallout universe so thats just the way it is
from the beginning you can see the references to the game how she describes her abilities game objects it is very integrated into the series the story is as elaborate as the games you feel that it is a story an opening for a new fallout for fans of the game who do not stop fantasizing about a new version it is the best they could have given uscharacters with different personalities and interests i loved walton and kyle they are too charismatic there is a lot to know about them and that is what i like about the series it explains everything but the characters are so deep that with all of them you want to know more everything in the series is worth it waiting for the second season
"the world is very well represented the look and the feel of the show takes me to the game and i give it  stars for that but characters maximus are too unrealistic which i think was done to make the lead lucy look smarter she is a good character she didnt need the help it took away from the show in the end i hope to see positive growth in the male characters in the second season i also would like to see more of the common creatures of the waste land that are in the games the game has so many great stories in it that could be included in the show
 i would love to see that japanese ship captain come to life"
twisted bloody violent and dark there is good left in our world but this isnt itfirst this story line is nothing new spoiler alert the evil in the world had finally outdone itself and destroyed itself all that has survived are a few remnants of humanity blah blah blahmaybe you need to be a sold out fan of this game to look past how worn out this storyline is nope this is not for menext twisting up sex with murder in a way that tries to make light of the murdereven make fun of itjust perpetuates that kind of evil that destroyed this science fiction world to begin withits not believableits not funnyits not originalwhat is itits a waste of time
movies based on games just dont work out they tried it with wow and dd and got a few diehards to watch them oncebut fallout has hit the jackpot this is just such a well thought out story with just the right amount of flashbacks thrown in just when you need them so it doesnt give away too much of the plotand the acting is superb ella purnell and aaron moten make a great team and lighten the mood when they arent kicking butt walt goggins is superb as usual with that smile that says trust me when you know you cant and leslie uggams  perfectthat said it is not a show for everybody if you are squeamish find something else to watch there are a lot of gross scenes which you should expect after a nuclear holocaust has occurred human behavior hasnt changed much the haves want more and the havenots just want something but dont know whats there sort of a mad max meets the walking deadi never played any of the video games in the long storied franchise but others have said it has stayed true to the games in the feel and context so im guessing that some of the producers played or watched others play the game to capture that feelingjust be careful you may want to binge watch the whole series at once and it is pretty intense
i never played the game so was hesistant to watch as it seems hollywood has run out of its own original ideas and is now plugging every game franchise it can get it grubby little fingers onbut what a great watch i mean excellent the reason i tuned into it was because of walton goggins he is such a skilled actor that i have admired for so long this is another fantastic feather in his ever increasing legendary capthe story is well thought out though has a parallel story arc as the resident evil plotline the whole insider job blahblahblah but its great tvevery episode highly entertaining theres something just fantastic about the mix of s music  apocalyptic mayhem i think that it was silent hill that first introduced johnny cash back into the mix when it comes to thrillers and s musicanyway loved it bring on season  i just hope nolan doesnt drag this series out like he did for westworld
this series is great watching it made me want to play the fallout games all over again specially fallout new vegas a favorite of mine the scenery is beautiful the main characters are interesting most of the time specially lucy the vault dweller the script is engaging and it shows all the things that whoever likes the game will also enjoy on the series but the main reason i wanted to watch this series is because of jonathan nolan loved his other projects such as person of interest and westworld and he is a good scifi series creatorsummarizing this series is worth the watch and worthy of your time to check it out
the film opens in  when la is suddenly nuked it then jumps  years later there exists an idyllic society that lives in carefully planned vaults vault  looks like it was inspired from the underground society in the cult classic a boy and his dog it appears to pay homage to the film by showing a poster of a film titled a man and his dog cooper howard walton goggins was a cowboy star during the red scare era he survives years later as a ghoul outside raiders disrupt the lives of those in the vault lucy maclean ella purnell becomes our naive protagonist as she leaves the safety of the vault to come the surface in search of her kidnapped father along the way she meets maximus aaron moten a soldier of the brotherhood they have similar goals and combine resourcesthis was a fun series regardless of all the science issues this should be scifi fantasy it leaves at a point that promises for a revenge filled second seasonguide fword sex and nudity but not too much
this show is so much like the game i was worried about it not being a good but its absolutely amazing im usually not one to write reviews but i just had to on this one the music the setting the characters create such an amazing atmosphere that completely depicts the same vibe as call out the video game i recommend watching this even if you have or have not played a video game because it is absolutely amazing i gave it a  out of  because i cant wait for the second season and after watching it im sure you will not be able to wait as well i promise you i will not regret a binge watching this
"season 
fallout has a particular flavor when it comes to post apocalyptic tales luckily the show captured it perfectly the aesthetic was perfect i felt like i was in the fallout world you could tell from the junk in the background and the uniforms and the way the armor looked whoever did the set design did their homeworkthe tale of these three characters are great the characters are very still developed and have great character arcsthis does a lot of fan service to the people who played the games if you like scifi post apocalyptic things andor wacky dark humor you might like this but if youre more of a casual show watcher this might not be for youbut there wasnt a lot to complain about the ending was okay but kinda meh the journey was great but the way it was tied up was not great imoi didnt like the liberties they took with some aspects of the lore but i understand this is an adaptation not a copy of the video games on a different mediumall in all i enjoyed the ride i cant wait for season two"
immersive and thrilling this film boasts impressive cgi a captivating story line and an intriguing mystery that keeps viewers hooked from start to finish however despite its many strengths theres a noticeable disparity in the acting department while the cgi elements excel in creating a visually stunning world some performances feel reminiscent of the characters in video games rather than genuine portrayals the story though engaging could have been elevated with more authentic and natural acting allowing viewers to fully immerse themselves in the postapocalyptic setting its better that than remind people that they are watching an adaptation of an oldish video game while this flaw may not be immediately apparent to all viewers it detracts from the overall experience and prevents the film from achieving its full potential nonetheless for fans of action and suspense this movie still offers an enjoyable ride through its dystopian landscape
if youre a fan of the fallout video game series youll likely enjoy this series and eagerly anticipate its continuation after watching however for those unfamiliar with the fallout games their reaction might be uncertain as certain aspects may not be fully understood its recommended they approach it as a scifi or cyberpunk series despite being episodic the first episode captivated me leading to a bingewatch of the entire series the storyline progressively improves and the main characters are very engaging fans of conspiracy theories may find this series particularly appealing as i did
let me start with the technical stuff i think the creators of this show did an amazing job at nailing the fallout look and vibe that goes way beyond just presenting some random props fans might know from the games we see the classic fallout world of  us aesthetics with early  technology grafted over futuristic inventions and then we see how that world might look like after a nuclear war and  years of decay so far so good it indicates a certain level of reverence for the source materialhowever this still isnt the fallout world we know from the video games and that is a surprising constant in the entire fallout series fallout always has two main components one is what might be called the nameless evil of the day so in the first fallout games that nameless evil was government overreach and conspiracies in following fallout games that nameless evil was science gone wrong and the bigoted cancer of irrational cults with this tv show that nameless evil is the selfish corporate interest of megacompanies having their own twisted social agendasthe other component is the eternally flawed human nature and how even the best of intentions when confronted by our craving for power and our desire to impose our wills on others will eventually corrupt any cause we deem worthy and goodthis mix of components is thrown into a dystopian future and the appeal of the fallout world is that it lets us decide what is the true evil is it the lawlessness and cruelty of the world we see or is it the nameless evil which shaped this worldthat is where the show has its problems we are rushed through this weighing of alternatives at such a pace that there is very little room for reflection we barely get to know the main characters before we are neckdeep in the conspiracy pervading this strange future in a way it feels like the writers were so afraid of appearing like just another generic mystery box tv show that they revealed their mystery way too earlythat being said its a good tv show i just fear that they tried to tell too much too fast for it to be a great show maybe a potential second season will take a deep breath slow down a bit and develop its protagonists better
ive only played fallout  so i am not a fanboy of the game from the first release like so many people are still the series did not disappoint the first thing i thought when i saw this was the art director deserves an emmy the place looks exactly like the video game the cities the towns the abandoned buildings are right out of the video game the art director did a masterful job in creating a wasteland of destroyed citiesella purnell and walton goggins were terrific the reason i didnt give the series an  or  star review is because of one character maximustitus i didnt like his storyline and i especially didnt like the actor i thought he was terrible he always has this forlorn sad look on his face and he always whined i just didnt like him at all especially the attempts at humor goggins on the other hand was terrific as usualfor those who dont know about the game we are in a mad max type environment after a nuclear war has almost completely destroyed civilization we have people living in underground vaults hoping to repopulate the earth one day after whatever is left on the surface has died but the surface dwellers arent too keen on dying out just yet we have various factions of all the different groups and of course radioactive monsters the story is done bascially in two different perspectives we experience the present while remembering the past and how the world got where it is today it tells how and why the vaults were built and how we came to war accompanying our protaganists is a sound track made up of mostly s and s songs its fine for a while but they overdo it a bitall in all i think this was a very good series and i can envision at least  more seasons i highly recommend this series
too much bad acting way to much music in almost every scene a messy plot not enough action monsters that are not nearly as dangerous as in the games and are killed easily for instance a gulper that is simply killed by dragging a man out of its mouth i didnt really understand how that was possible at all to kill a big scary monster like that the main characters do a decent job trying to make the series interesting but many of the other characters are simply bad actors a lot of scenes are confusing and a lot of questions about why the characters do what they do or say what they say are left unanswered the good thing about the whole thing is the visuals and the environment that is very true to the game series but thats about it maybe i expected too much but it felt like a less than mediocre nuka cola
this adaptation takes some big swings it captures the essence of the games  the dark humor the retrofuturism the brutal world  but the execution isnt always smoothnailed the tone the show perfectly blends the series signature dark comedy with genuine postapocalyptic grit expect laughoutloud moments alongside moments of genuine horrorworld building the california wasteland feels livedin and dangerous filled with familiar and mutated creatures and callbacks to the games lorestrong cast the characters are engaging with the protagonists wideeyed innocence a great counterpoint to the jaded wasteland veterans
falloutfallout based on the successful video game franchise produced by bethesda does a great job of capturing the atmosphere of fallout  specifically like the game the audience is thrust into a world where you dont quite know whats going onnuclear war has taken place and a small percentage of humanity live in vaults safe from the radiation the goal is to wait out the fallout from the bombs and go back to the surface when the leader of vault  is kidnapped his daughter bravely goes to the surface to find that nothing she believed was truein the  years since the bombs fell not everyone was put into vaults and a form of lawlessness has fallen over california bounty hunters scavengers and a military brotherhood fights to survive the horrors that continueas in most video games a magic item or person or prophecy suddenly appears and getting from point a to point b becomes the ultimate goal but dont forget side quests thats where you learn the most information of coursefor fans of the game they did a great job with the visuals and the storytelling for those who had no idea what was happening they also did a great job unfolding the mysteries of the past present and alluding to a future the show did leave it open for a second season and i truly hope one is createdi wont spoil anything as this is brand new but i recommend it as a good science fiction post apocalyptic and a questionable morality experience the reasons behind the war and everything after are a bit of a stretch though
i often find it difficult to remain engaged in a tv series most i put down after watching either the first few episodes or sometimes even just the first episodethat wasnt the case here i played the games and decided to watch with family that hadnt and it had a bit of everything you were always wondering what was going to happen next it was weird  in a good way even for someone like me in having played the games before they throw in new storylines and ways of setting the scene that capture what makes fallout fallout in its own unique wayhighlight was the music  both the composed pieces and licenced songs seriously there is nothing quite like this series do give it a chance
i love the fallout game series i have been playing them for decades i love the postapocalyptic world i love the back story and glimpses into the past ive always said the fallout world would make a great movie or tv show but if the past is any indication it would not do the games justice except this series i was blown away by the attention to detail its like they mirrored the game to the screen i felt like i was playing another iteration of my favorite franchise story was a bit slow in the beginning but quickly picked up the pace love the bits of humor thrown in just like the games but also is equally dystopian in all its glory would love more of inon zurs original music from the games there is a taste of it here and there but i would love to hear more with all the positive feedback i am confident this will get picked up for more seasons keep em coming i love it
the premise of fallout is very disturbing and dark but the writers did a magnificent job of balancing that with humor in fact i would say how they handled the dark with the light is the best part of this seriesfallout must be gory edgy profane and disgusting some are put off by that but that is the fallout world those who have played the games know that well the producers did a good job presenting that world the contrast between vault dwellers and the abovegrounders was well craftedthe characterizations for the most part were good the costuming was excellent the settings and attention to details was very good this is one of those series where the cost of production can skyrocket within just a few seasons and likely cause it to be canceled but i hope we can get several seasons before that happens
"completely unfamiliar with the video game have followed wades career however and as usual he delivers carrying the heart and soul of the seriesno spoilers heregood old fashioned classic tale sorta good vs evil but who actually are the good guys or the bad guysthe authors do a great job engaging their politics within the scenery set designs and experiences of the individual characters as opposed to preaching and ramming silliness down the viewers throatsthey present a most unforgiving world which removes a lot of modern silly wokeness and pronouns when survival is the base necessity
they show that stuff gets tossed to the wayside in season  anyhow
this allows the viewer to make up their own inferences and ideas as the story kinda s l o w l y unfoldsyes i get it yall be watchin and flippin through your phones but the story eventually begins to move along and percolate nicely into a good old mysterygorgeous set designs and use of classic music in the first few episodes to beautifully exemplify the disparity of their past vs the future we and they are presented with the entire production is beautifully stylized the film the costumes the plot oh myevery detail in their world is superbly presented which makes the world presented believableevery actor do their characters justice
all skilled from bit players to scene stealers they give their characters depth and we can feel their desperation in such an unforgiving worldate season one up like popcornlooking forward to an engrossing story line so sit back open your mind and get carried away into a fun filled action packed distopiarod sterling would be proud"
the adaptation of the universe in which it takes place is close to perfect the locations are spot on and it definitely feels like fallout the main characters are mostly great with a few exceptions and the story is ok all in all it feels like the show finds it pace and the characters feels settled in the last couple of episodes it bodes great for the second seasonthere are however a few things that dont sit right with me the major thing being the ghouls in the games have always been explained by radiation but in the show people are made into ghouls by a some concoctionall in all a good show worth seeing even if youve never played the games
im really enjoying this show i only have one and a half episodes lefti dont have much knowledge of the game but as the show goes  it is way better than most shows coming out nowadaysi love that this show is not afraid to show character flaws and they do a good job of showing how ppl turn out based off life experiences it is refreshing to see characters that have to over come adversity it is a very much needed break from what hollywood has done to female leads and their male counter parts in the last few yearsthe only character issue that i am having is maximus it took me a while to pinpoint what bothered me about the character and i think its the fact that he reminds me of a confused and angry teenager that is just now learning the ways of the world his emotions go back and forth too much for me and his actions dont feel consistent it doesnt help that i cant for the life of me figure out how old he is supposed to be i assumed he was a  to  year old man when he was first introduced this gave me a certain expectation in behavior so i was caught off guard when he started acting the way he did he seemed bitter immature and naive at times brave sometimes  but other times a complete coward they tried to make him look like a good guy but his actions said otherwiseanyway i just found out that he is  in real life so he was probably  when he filmed i guess ill find out for sure how old he is once i watch the last  episodesother than that im loving the show and the whole maximus thing doesnt bother me too much but it does take me out of the show every now and then
firstly and this applies to the games as well  years is way too farfetched industrialized civilizations could have risen twiceover it gives me the impression the games and thus this show were originally designed for  years after the war enough time for a postwar generation to reach adulthood and entropy to catchup to vaultdwellers but then some seagull flew in and went no make it two hundred years but by then it was too late to change all the artwork so mentally knock a zero off that number and itll godown more easilyayways the show is a mild dark comedy set in a fantasy retrofuture but a little slow at times a little sparse with the comedylucy worked well as a sheltered vaultdweller and she evolves over the series maximus is an interesting flawed character not likable but clearly has some growingup to do howard is cad bane dogmeat had way more personality than in the game but they missed a golden opportunity with the boobytraps searh goddamn it dogmeat maybe next seasonthe brotherhood were well portrayed though they kinda glossed over the purity thing and having a lame oldman incharge didnt quite fit with their mightisright ideology vault dwellers were a bit too hammy not enough internal farce  owngoals as suggested by the games we dont see much of the enclave or other factionstheres only one robot and there are no orcs aka supermutants which is probably for the best given the current state of vfx mr gutsy was sorely missed as was some of the vicious anticommunist rhetoric from the games also missing was the allimportant looting not looting a corpse naked is a bit of a fallout faux pas likewise not carryingoff the entire contents of a lairthe story is pretty tiresome yet another daddyissues production i often wonder why americans pumpout so many of these theres some mystery surrounding the vaults and a certain raider but with the usual predictable were the baddies outcome the games had similar problems but at least there you could completely ignore it to do your own thing especially fallout  here were forced to ride along lucys linear monothreaded quest for her dad which in itself didnt feel compelling as we dont know much about either of them even by the end the story of maximus was more interesting as his mistakes  lies start to snowball into a flashmanesque victory but again we really dont know enough about the character to care that much bane was more fleshed out but so at odds with his prewar persona will be interesting to see howwhy he became so cruel i suspect lucys dad represents an amalgam the player from the different games given the trail of destruction in his wakebesides the excellent robot vfx here was pretty distracting like early s bsg cylons distracting milky cataract compositing white skies softglows poorly animated powerarmor unfinished gulpers and the deep dark abyss of howards gaping nosehole after witnessing all of this i go back to look at transformers   seventeen years ago and lament what happened to you vfx you used to be beautifulsets were mostly great but ruined by the cg in many cases lighting was all over the place from natural sunlit to overcast to stage lit sometimes in the same sequence there were no radstorms costumes  props were nowhere near as good as those in fallout some of the bg  minor characters looked like cosplayers and quite a few were wellfed  indoorsymusic was either great historical recordings or forgettable the rest the scene with the music critics was hilarious
the potential of the fallout property is huge and this series is marred with poor writing visual fx timing and actingive been a fan of the games for a long time and had immediate mixed feelings upon discovering a series was in the works on the one hand i was excited to be pulled back into the postapocalyptic war torn wasteland and reintroduced to my favourite characters and creatures however i immediately understood this could be another cash grab series designed to meet the bare minimum for fans and simultaneously draw in a larger audience of new admirers after watching the first season the latter has been confirmedtheres are many times the dialogue is uninteresting and poorly timed only exasperated by the lacklustre acting the fight scenes are rubbish and remind me of a s budget movie where the punches are feet away from the target moreover the vfx and staging are so uninspired it feels youre watching actors on a setit does not feel like a show set in the fallout universei would much rather no series at all than this poor excuse of a fallout show
for someone who spent a thousand hours in the game on console and vr this series brought me back thanks for making this great the characters the chems and stims the products the comfort of the vault and question of why things are they way they are amounts to mind candy for me ive watched it twice and will most likely go for a third round yeah the relationships between the characters were different but they made up for that with little gems like the vendor yelling dogmeat the soundtrack had me singing along the whole time more please and soon until then ill be on my next play through crawling out through the fallout baby
brilliant show cant wait for more of it true to the game series in terms of its story telling character choices and humour like any long term fan i was concerned and skeptical it wont be as good as you hope but it certainly did not disappoint really looking forward to how they expand on the world they have created in future seasons also looking forward to seeing how the characters develop over time and the introduction of more lore and easter eggs from the various game titles no spoilers in this review want to say if you are a fan of the franchise you should absolutely watch this show highly recommended
"overall the show looks good and sounds good the tone is perfect with all characters being ridiculous i grew up with fo and fo and the show is more in line with later games but its fineits starts to fast introducing everyone in st episode and then continues with weird cuts to different charactersthe characters and not particularly likable with
except for walton goggins he is great lucy is like a mormon that never seen and outside world  the problem is that it is rarely funny maximus on the other hand is not relatable why does he do what he do  what people hurt him and what revenge he wants to tak perhaps it is a set up for later reveal but right now he is somehow bland  is he good bad opportunistic he seems exactly like star wars black trooper who was there but is not remembered because he wasnt well written character or really relevant to the storysome people complained that many game locations are absent or destroyed i guess they are right there is a missed opportunity for many referencessame with the brotherhood  enclave looks a bit like like both factions were merged into one but perhaps again it is a set up for later seasonsone glaring aspect of the show is ultra violence its a trend lately the boys gen v invincible and probably more the game was never so bloody although there were occasional decapitations it doesnt really add to the show that muchfallout is a really well made adaptation it capture many aspects of the game its just overall the show doesnt make you care about its characters character motivations are unconvincing the last of us show managed it better but still i hope next fallout season will be better"
i love the fallout franchise and have hundreds of hours of play time the storyline and the lore is really what i find captivating about the whole franchise i thought they did a great job on the series and for me its about the details which i felt they nailed my only complaint is the story arc feels all over the place its fallout  meets elements of fallout  some new vegas with fallout  storyline but in the desert i was looking for something more connected to at least one of the game storylines i love the characters especially the ghoul the serum dr guy and of course lucy the flash forwards and then backwards admittedly are a bit hard to follow i will have to watch it all over again so that i can get it
its really wild to think that this would be the project that jonathan nolan would hang his hat on and say hey now this this is something and throughout watching the season i couldnt quite tell if this was the product of someone who lived the games or todd howard himself and it turns out it was todd howard himself but to reduce this show down to a comparison to the last of us wouldnt do the show justice by any means this takes the spirit of the games along with its humor and runs with it lisa joy jonathan nolan and co weave a such a well crafted season of television that it makes me ashamed to say i even doubted the duo that crafted the first season of westworld theres a world that i want to stretch a lawn chair out in and sit back with my nuka colaella purnells lucy is a warm center to anchor this story in surrounded with excellent characters like moises arias norm and of course the selling point of the show walton goggins ghoul of a character makes me want scream yee haw and run through the desert buck nakedi cant wait to see what happens with the rest of this shows life whether it suffer the fate of so many other amazon prime shows or god forbid befall the fate of a show like the boys i just hope we can revel in this fun world that the nolans have made for a good time and hopefully a long timeblu
ive never played fallout the game ive heard of it but new nothing about its contentso i went into this series blindmaybe for me that was the best way as i can just enjoy it for what it isor maybe im missing little references from the gamebut i can look those up and delve more into the loreas for the tv show i can honestly say im impressedthe colours feel and story were all top notch in tonethe acting from walton goggins meant he was perfectly cast as the ghoulcooper and the duality of his character was brilliantella purnell was also superb in her role no silly feminist politics just great action scenes and wide eyed wonder and bewilderment at what she was seeing and finding outgive this show a tryvery entertaining
im going to abstain from rating this title as i did not play the games and feel like a lot of the jokes tone and character dynamics may have been lost on mefrom the perspective of a newcomer the opening was a bit trite i found all of the characters dynamics and world building to be pretty boring cringe inducing and otherwise unbelievableonce they got through the adventure stage and actually started introducing the backstory is where it got interesting for me the origins of the vaults backstory regarding the main characters and the politics of the world added a lot of missing context which allowed me to actually invest in the story being toldi will definitely stay tuned for future seasons but have some grievances about the first seasonthe lack of consequence for those in dangerous and near death situations the stupidly jovial disposition of the characters the general stupidity and inconsistency in character choices all really strain ones ability to suspend disbeliefi feel like this may be an artifact left from the game as the unseriousness definitely seems deliberate so im giving it a pass for now even if  for me  it takes away from the seriesthe last couple of episodes really save the series so dont quit early
this is a goodquality postapocalyptic film adaptation of the game universe filled with black humor and comical cruelty so the film is recommended only for viewers over the age of  the fifth series stands out in particular in which excellent directing and a welldeveloped script create an eccentric adventure of complex characters the artists did a great job on the visual design the visual effects are acceptable and the characters are motivated and their conflicts are readablethe painted inhabitants of the wasteland may seem too plastic as well as power armor but the degree of discrepancy does not cause strong dissonance and you can put up with these conventions because the series has an intriguing plot and voluminous characters each character is endowed with an individual character background beliefs  you sympathize with them and worry about themhowever it may seem to some viewers that the plot is too focused on personal drama which is why the series sometimes sags on protracted explanations which can cause fatigue despite this the film can captivate with intriguing twists and the atmosphere of the film corresponds to the game lore which will appeal to fans but unfortunately it does not immerse into the world of the apocalypse does not convey the threat and struggle for survival but entertains with bright colors and comical characters the role of walton goggins who created the colorful hardened the ghoul stands out in particular aaron moten does not seem to me suitable for the image of a knight lover in my opinion the casting director should have looked for a more suitable actor it is somewhat annoying to see his surprised face ella purnell who was chosen for the role of a resident of the asylum plays reliably she emotionally conveys the image of a woman whose worldview will change as the plot develops in general the picture was not bypassed by processing for compliance with the quotas of inclusivity and respect for racial diversity but fortunately the picture will not focus on gender guidelinesbefore watching the movie series fallout i was skeptical but when i started watching i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of work on the script bold jokes and a realistic look at the postapocalyptic world although i am not a fan of the game but only played in fallout  i accepted the world of the movie series without a doubt and gladly immersed myself in its atmosphere of radiation and the tragedy of human destiniesas i said there is too much drama in the picture from the controversial novice of the brotherhood to the hypocritical caretaker of the asylum this tragedy in my opinion is overloaded there is clearly not enough humor for balance it is black humor that sets the crazy pace of postapocalyptic fun but it sags under the plot necessity  to build a structure of motives and goals rather this is a feature of the series not a disadvantage its very difficult to please or balance emotions and i dont blame the authors  they did a good job and this work is at a decent creative level
amazon delivers us a bombshell that finally puts a stop to the curse of failed video game adaptations just after hbos last of us not being an inveterate fan of the bethesda studios franchise the series captivated me from the first episode without letting me down until its excellent finale which leaves the way open for an eponymous season the success of fall out lies in all its interesting characters and its world building between dark humor retro futuristic and post apocalypse a skewer of imperfect burnt heads but which gains in complexity as the story progresses whether you are a neophyte or a fan of the saga you will never be lost because jonathan nolan and lisa joy have succeeded in respecting the lore of the game to the letter by sprinkling easter eggs all along the road but without destabilizing the new comer a production of impressive quality in both form and substance and which positions itself as one of the big tv moment for  fan of westerns retro science fiction slapstick comedy conspiracy theory and video games fall out is everything listed above and much more grandiose
"capturing the essence of the hit video games from bethesda studios season  of fallout wisely didnt stray too far from the original look feel and vibe of this iconic and unnerving storylinefrom the threat of nuclear war  something which were facing today  to the actual manifestation of it the series delivered on the high notes or should i say mushroom cloudsthe literal fallout of what would happen to society and civilization in case of nuclear destruction played out in earnest as first seen through the eyes of the game developershaving played the game on pc and thoroughly enjoying it back in the day this series made me feel nostalgia and intrigue in equal measure intrigue because there were some subtle yet dramatic liberties plottwists and character modifications coldfusion energy for instance was new to the showall in all i was far from disappointed though im admittedly not a diehard fan of the franchise i liked the games enough to appreciate what they did with this liveaction adaptation  t suits pipboy wristmonitors and allthe setting was the same as in the original namely los angeles postapocalyptic themes and tropes unravelled with each episode carried on the backs of amazing performances both inside and outside the underground nuclear bunkersan incredible amount of empathy prevailed in the tale which fastforwarded  years into the future after la was nuked the plot gradually started filling out in earnest aligning with the games original vision in beautiful meant artistically wayskyle maclachlan as overseer hank maclean had an enviable screen presence ive been a fan of his work from dune  to desperate housewives  so seeing him give another great performance in another scifi universe was amazingella purnell as lucy maclean was the actual protagonist of this tv series she did great work held her own and established a remarkable character arc her evolution from an innocent young vaultcitizen to a confident explorer was worth watchingmoises arias as norm maclean was both amusing and mysterious his work in other projects are worth noting because only then will you appreciate how nuanced his acting was in this onevillainy with purpose sarita choudhury as lee moldaver brought plenty of outstanding moments to the series i didnt like the way things ended for her because i was so looking forward to watching more of her in season  fallout the character and the artist brought rebellious brilliance to bear on season  thoughaaron moten as maximus brought several notable elements to the script his emphatic acting blended well with his more idiotic moments and lucky turns making maximus feel like a true survivormichael emerson as wilzig was amazing i adored his work in lost tv series  his subtle yet portentous performance was great to see in this one the belgian shepherd dog hed saved cx real name lana  was a memorable additionmichael rapaport as knight titus was great despite his brief screentime his casual cruelty left an impression i remember seeing rapaports online videos and sundry commentaries he brought a lot of that wit and penchant for sarcasm to his limited role in season  of falloutthe ghoul was my favourite character in the game and walton goggins didnt make me change my mind in the latest fallout series when he expertly tackled the role of cooper howard the man became one of the mutant humans called ghouls with incredibly extended lifespans he gave a riveting performance blessed with swagger and suave that made me enjoy every scene in which he showed upfallout season  made me admire the game even more especially how ahead of its time it was i liked how they sustained a vintageamerican playlist which again was similar to the game in which we could play such songs over the radio on those wristbound pipboysdespite a few rushed and contrived moments fallout lived up to its hype and delivered some amazing and consistently nostalgic entertainment all the characters were regaling the ending of season  set the stage for extraordinary things to comefallout succeeded in capturing a cinematic vibe and bottled some essential truths particularly the one that we are all facing today namely the consequences of war and potential nuclear fallout

 episodes was enough for me wildly over hyped show that misses almost all of its marks the ghoul appears to be an interesting character but overall youll be looking at your watch wondering how time seems to stand still when this show is runningother reviewers have mentioned the naivety of the characters it beggars belief quite literally save yourself the effort of trying to like any of the characters maybe buy the video gamesi get that they need to stretch some basic ideas out over a large number of shows but this asks for a lot of forgiveness straight up from the viewer and frankly ive run out of fs to give on this one
i never played the game my only acquaintance with fallout is watching the gameplay from aside a bit so from this perspective i would say that this show was made brilliantly from the plot to the character to acting and effects the characters are very deep and this is what mainly sold me the show its rare to see such writing latelythe different types of people that exist in this world were portrayed very realistically and i specifically liked the emphasis on how difficult life circumstances dont create heroesthey also wrote lucys character brilliantly they avoided of making the lately toocommon mistake of writing strong female characters that are simply better than men just because theyre female similar to shehulk and rings of power lucy is strong because though all the traumas she went through practically from the beginning she never lost her friendliness hope and never stopped to try to see the good in people shes selfconfident because she was brought up in a safe environment not because shes a womanthe acting was also great the main ones that i personally really liked were ella walton hes always great in all of his roles and dave who someone managed to look like an innocent boy in a mans bodyanyway highly recommend to watch this series
ive been reading some of the one star reviews of this series and i felt to bad on behalf of the human race i felt the need to write my owni loved this series as a long time fallout fan i enjoyed every minute firstly the attention to detail is incredible the soundtrack the random items on tables eg sugar bombs the red rocket gas stations the pipboy this was clearly created i collaboration with fans or extremely talented producersthe plot is good theyve kept the vault back stories and created their own one for the series which is great it dovetails together nicely with the overall story arc i like how they show the pre and post war worlds and have stitched that together through following the ghoulif i had a criticism it would be that i didnt really relate to maximus im not sure if were meant to feel sorry for him or grow to like him but it never really happened for me i find him very cold cowardly and uninspiringlucy on the other hand was great watching her ongoing realisation about how the world was like and seeing her get progressively tougher without losing her pure spirit was a great balancing act and purnell nailed it for methere was so much fallout content in this show but also so much missing im so pleased they renewed for a second season and im hoping the content theyve hinted at throughout series one makes an appearance i also hope they dont rush it and keep the incredible attention to detail and pure fallout vibe given how high theyve set the bar itll be painful but ill wait if it means they make it right
"never played the game this show is wickedly funny there has been atomic war and now we see the future there are ghouls zombies supersized bugs of course humans still fighting other humansso some live in vaults all safe and sound one vault is raided and the head guy is taken the episodes revolve around his daughterlucy trying to find himof course theres more to it than that we learn about the characters backgrounds and how they came to be we also learn how the vaults began and how they are maintainedthe vaults see to be paradise but lets just say not all is well in paradise
hope to see more
not for kids earns m rating"
incredible adaptation im a huge fan of the game since the very beginning and following the story ever since excellent work and im looking forward for the second season  thumbs upgoing right now to start over the video game franchise so many emotional moments just like in the game so many action sequences just like the game and so many landmarks very well usedi missed some iconic animals characters and of course the first sight of a mutant underworld some amazing cities like rivet city look at the enclave and many awesome detailsexcellent series excellent actors and production
ok so never played the game but the trailer caught our eye cant stop watching it visually stunning and entertaining plot line the sets and characters are entirely believable plus the way in which its written brings you in from the start each character has been given ample time to understand the background to them and as the series is progressing you begin to understand whats motivation for each one of themive also got to give a mention to the music that has been selected for it absolutely brilliant if you didnt like off thevwall s and obscure country you will by the time you start watchingsit down grab a bottle of wine relax and enjoy
fallout is an adaptation of the eponymous gaming series which i am a fan of it is overall a decent series but with some caveats if you are not familiar with the setting you will feel lost i saw it with my girlfriend and she had some issues following everything because things arent explained very well it almost feels as if they expect the viewers to be familiar with the settingthe series biggest issue is the pacing some of the middle episodes drag on a bit and it feels like barely anything happened the ending is excellent with twists that somewhat redeems the rest of the series barely anything is revealed along the middle episodes and they have instead crammed everything on the final episode i feel it would have been better if they had sprinkled some of these reveals and surprises in between the other episodesi definitely recommend the series but dont go in expecting an amazing one you will definitely have a good time though expect to also be a bit confused during the series and expect to feel lost until the ending which will explain everything a good series that could have been excellent 
i started to watch the serie and the first episode reproduce the vault exactly the game is it is a big revival for the people who play fallout     and  for manny years i enjoyed every minute of this season great jog amazon primethe characters are similar to the game brotherhood of steels maximus the supervisor of the vault  the clothes the big armoron the beggining you can see a commercial on the tv before the nuclear bomb starts the destruction it is possible to see the nuka cola and the magazine of agnarokthe vault is full of details the advertisement on the walls the guns and everythingbrillant serie of the year
"i have a sneaking suspision that tod howard had too much influence on thisand it seems they threw new vegas under the bus
one of the best fallout games ever
if this is true its really sad and seemingly spiteful
i enjoyed the show for the most part was alot of strong preformancesbut the first half of the show was far better than the second halfit seems like it had alot of direction and drive first few episodes and then just lost itself by the end
all in all its not a bad show and had some cool acting humor and gore
but was bogged down by wierd pacing later episodes and alot of tropes
and some boringsmall sets and very small finale fight"
i am not a fan of the fallout games as i have never played them however i assume theres plenty of good material enough to make a good show perhaps my expectations were high but i was not impressed by the story sure some acting was good and the scenery was done well but the story wasnt good there is a source of infinite energy thats planted inside ben linuss head there is an ironman suit that apparently anyone can use without much training there are super zombies called ghouls that can stay alive for a very long time and still have all their mental faculties some guy living in the middle of nowhere can survive without food or water fingers can be attached and function perfectly and the cherry on the top in the final episode of season  vaulttek decided to nuke the planet because of capitalism sad times we live in
its one of the best series ever reminds me of the games franchise and also had many game quest references like the boy in a fridge also the brotherhood of steel feels is exactly like in the game awesome work which brings a more of a nostalgia and feel of the game and bethesda did a great job in mixing those with the series i didnt see any conflict in the series plot and the games franchise which is great i cant wait for season  i hope it doesnt take long as i almost losing my patience because it got many mysteries to be solved viewers might have many questions in mind regarding those i hope to see the institute and synths in the second season
this show is pretty spot on a bit better than another video game show i have been watching i keep seeing places that i saw in the game places i went into and explored makes me want to play the games again the bloodiness violence and cornyness is exactly how the game was i am having so many aha moments elbowing my husband saying hey that scene or monster or character looks just like the game the characters are pretty close to what was in the game loving it so farpkeep following the games and we will continue to watch the showif you havent played the games i hope this inspires you they are so much fun and you have to use your imagination to make them your own
its easy to be a pessimist in film and tv now in days im not different i had zero hope in this series but it truly does deliver i am already watching it again where there are some questions of lore accuracy and the somewhat shoe horned romance doesnt feel necessary it is just fun i had fun watching it and truly love the use of practical effects when done i do hope they keep steering in that direction but just watch i had a good time both timesit keeps the whimsy of the wasteland while having the grim aspects i do wish the world was a little bigger i think of the towns in fallout games vs the show it does feel rather baron
greetings from the other side i dont think i played this game back in  as i was enjoying ultima online at that time therefore i came into this without any preconceptionsi really enjoyed this first season especially coggins as the ghoul there were some things that i didnt care for like all of the old s music it would have been better if they played less of thatthe effects were good the t battle armour was fun to watch in action id love to try out something like that as im sure we all would the ghoul character was probably my favorite in this show he was just so entertaining whenever he was on screen ella and max were well done characters as welli also enjoyed the various crazy characters that they bumped into during their journeyim looking forward to a second season and totally recommend this series
as a fan of the game series and a fan of film and stories this is one of the greatest things i have ever seen its just as fantastic as the game its twisted enthralling and pure insanity the humor plays perfectly the tech plays out perfectly i wont even call this fan service as that term feels cheap this is something special this show brought us here from the game and i think this show will bring others to the game i was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire  episodes its a wasteland opera that exceeded my wildest expectations i absolutely love lucy as the protagonist what a fantastic choice and direction to take and ella nailed it goggins was absolutely fantastic i cant wait to see the path of maximus continue and was very well played by aaron absolutely loved him i was unsure of what to make of norm right up until the end but it turns out hes just one more character i cant wait to see more of well done mr airas well done im giving this  because i loved every minute i cant wait to make my father watch this and get hooked he has no idea of what he has in his future and im sure that old man is going to love it
the whole series is inspired by an very old popular classic game called fall out and being a fall out player getting a series based on it made me feel happy and now i came to know that the whole series is absolutely very cool performance of all the characters fits well so this is a must watch series like wednesday addams and other few good series definitely worth  rating from my side and i hope that season  will be arrived soon with a lot of good content like the season  did and i hope that it will be great and cool if you still didnt watched the series then go and watch it out immediately
once again i wrote a review without watching the whole season and once again imdb deleted that review just like they did for  body problemwell i have now watched the full season of fallout because for some reason i couldnt turn it off i kept thinking this is terrible and i should watch something else but i just couldnti certainly didnt enjoy the comedy but i did enjoy the performance of some of the actors like walton goggins and aaron moten but my special praise is for ella purnell who i thought was brilliant so the  ive given it is just for ella i think without her i wouldnt have watched the whole seriesi dont know much about the games as ive only played one of the once and i got bored so is this meant to have comedy
i ended up binge watching the entire series in one night  that is just how engrossing this streaming series isits a voyage of discovery in a postnuclear apocalypse world as a young woman exits from her underground vault in search of her father who has been carried off by raiders who entered from the surface wastelandthere are some plot twists involving evil capitalists and flashbacks about how and why the entire vault tech network of underground nuclear shelters was set up in the first placethe flashbacks are set in a sort of s era fashion style which is also interestingall in all this was a great show and im looking forward to watching the second season alreadyp s im not a gamer so i dont know much about the lore of the video game series this is based on but having seen a lot of other movies and tv series based on video games most of them dont come anywhere close to this level of quality so this is a major plus
lets start with the positives the characters and the acting are great a real tribute to the fallout series i enjoyed the sets and the quirky but amusing dialogue i see a lot of criticism of the cheap sets and inconsistencies but they are nitpicking personally i didnt notice anything that disturbed my sense of disbelief from a visual aspect i really enjoyed itthe negative is the cowardice of the script writers i wont put any spoilers in but i can say that if you see anything bad happen then dont worry they will invent a stupid plot device to make it unhappen once you realise they keep doing this then you get uninvested in the characters as you know nothing will really happen to them there are no real consequences for any actions they takeif you accept this series has less gravitas than a tom and jerry cartoon and are ok with watching it for the one liners then its a fun way to waste a few hours on the other hand if you like caring about characters and how they develop then move on
i dont understand how this show is so well rated the actors where well cast but everything else seems slighlty off especially the tone i always thought it was ironic humor within a devastatingly bleak atmosphere the colors are off too it needs a filter half joke everything seems to easy big disappointment i think its over for me as a fallout fan because f had the same problem it was a fun game but it didnt have a lot of depth sound familiar this is my gripe with the show illustrated by wilzig has been walking around for days by episode  and his shirts are still ironed it feels like no one is actually thinking what it would be like to be in the wasteland if you are like me and you didnt like the show it might be time to say goodbye because this is the direction that fallout will be taking constant marvel style jokes but about sex non stop oof but im not the first to complain when fallout was underground it could be truly subversive critical and new when it becomes mainstream it becomes just that status quo rebelliousness
i have played all the games and was eagerly anticipating the release of the show to be honest i didnt expect it to be as good as it turned out to be i was expecting a lighthearted approach with more comedy and less violence and gore however i was pleasantly shocked by the direction the show took which was a perfect blend of action violence humor and storytellingthe pacing of each episode was spot on keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout i was hooked from the very first episode and each subsequent episode left me wanting more the story was captivating and i loved how the show explored it from every perspective i found myself empathizing with each faction and i couldnt help but feel invested in their respective journeys at the moment i am firmly on team coop but i am open to switching sides in the upcoming seasonhowever the only minor issue i had with the show was something that most people could probably guess i understand that many studios feel compelled to include certain elements for political reasons and this show was no exception while i acknowledge the importance of these issues i felt that it detracted somewhat from the overall experience despite this i still greatly enjoyed the show and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thrilling actionpacked adventure with plenty of heart and soul
im more of a casual fallout game fan so the franchise isnt precious to me im more of a elder scrolls fan as such i adore this show it blends the perfect ratio of silliness comedy drama intrigue and action the casting is spot on with ella purnell stealing the show its nicely shot the music is greatthere are no flaws here i really hope they can keep the quality up for multiple seasonsim increasingly getting fed up with amazon streaming and their business model ads etc but they keep making great shows i wish they didnt so i could cancel my membership and feel good about myselfbut here we are dammit well done again amazon
as a longtime fan of the games i honestly cringed when i saw theyd made an adaptation but boy was i wrong this show is amazing the casting is incredible and theres something for the gamer and firsttime watcher okay i lied theres a lot more for the gamer countless nods to beloved characters incredible graphics and set design great casting writing cinematography and music alike i eagerly await many seasons to come and am so glad i gave it a chance only to devour the the entire season in a scant few days keep up the great work mr nolan and company youve renewed my love of this fantastic franchise and made me hopeful for a new game to follow
the show is filled with many aspects of falloutwith a amazing to say at least story line behind each characters there is a character for everyones personality to enjoy and enhance the experience of watching the  episode season which is surly going to have a second season coming to production each episode having a somewhat intoxicating addiction to binge watch the entire season in one sitting proves to be a fully successful and encaptive show allowing each episode to recape its last and be just as enjoyable as the last if not better i have never written a review for anything but u would truly appreciate a second season
as a longtime fan of the video game franchise and a cinematographer myself this series checks all the boxes if you are a fan theres no way you will not like this and even if you never heard of fallout you will definitely get hookedwhile it is not the most amazing or original of stories the plot is at the very least good but this is one of those cases where it is not about the general plot but the details and wellwritten journey its a wild adventure full of moral questioning that is in most cases overshadowed by the wellachieved humor or the gore and violent scenes which is just what fallout is all abouti was especially surprised by how well they captured the ambiance and vibe of the fallout apocalyptic world the art design the ost the costume design and especially the vfx although the last episode did fall a little in this department were all at a blockbuster level of detail and realismi cannot wait for the next season
to be able to watch a show that completely captures a game that i spent hundreds of hours delving in the world of fallout is really special the characters are true to fallout form and the world building was percise the atmosphere was able to take you one step beyond what the game could to really bring the fallout world to life in a way the game could not because you are generally too busy looting and min maxing to really read every report on a vault computer overall it is something truly special i hope the next season sticks to this formula and cant wait for the next single player fallout
a thrilling journey through the postapocalyptic wasteland capturing the essence of the beloved game franchise with its gritty atmosphere complex characters and nods to the game lore its a treat for both fans and newcomers alike the cast delivers stellar performances especially in portraying the struggle for survival and moral ambiguity in a world ravaged by nuclear war while some pacing issues arise the captivating story and immersive worldbuilding more than compensate overall the fallout tv show is a mustwatch for anyone craving dystopian adventures and thoughtprovoking narratives
from the trailers i was like manidk if im gonna like this especially with how video game adaptations have gone in the past but this show imho overall is an  some episodes are a  but i think when you add up all of the storylines and the lore its fantastic and an absolute blast you really start to relate to all of the main leads and see their character development throughout especially found myself interested in norm and the vault storyline it became super creepy and tense and my only wish is that that had more of a payoffthis is coming from someone who started with new vegas then fallout  and fallout  this show was awesome
season  of fallout is entertaining but having too many writers and directors involved definitely made things often feel a bit too awkward and convoluted and the last of us still blows this away by a very wide margin in terms of storytelling character development and performancesbecause unlike tlou i imagine its pretty tough for most nonvideo game players to be able to find lots to love here in terms of the messy plotlines and character developmentand i hate to say it but all the castmembers portraying members of the brotherhood could use some serious acting lessons and also could benefit from better dialogue from more seasoned tv screenwriters toolike its genuinely uncomfortable to watch most of the brotherhood scenes throughout the entire season 😔on the other hand walton goggins and we need more matt berry and dogmeat is the clear mvp among the cast and ella purnell also does solid work as lucy too but again shes needs much better screenwriters to back her up because shes clearly an experienced actress that already has the range but i was actually surprised how great moises arias turned out to be as lucys younger brother and his character had the most interesting plot line of the whole season imomy least favorite part is that i really wish the writing wasnt so corny for ella purnell and aaron motensome pretty painful cringeworthy moments when the writers tried to muddle humor and romance in ways that winds up just feeling like a bad marvel movie and there was so embarrassingly little chemistry there to begin with so it felt so out of place and unnecessary that these two characters were even forced to be in a relationship to begin withon a more positive note what impressed me most of all was the attention to detail in the practical elements of the production design  you can tell the set designers are massive fans of the games 😊overall lots of fun twists in the last episode kyle machlachlan doesnt disappoint 👑 but in general i think this first season is definitely way too overhyped  still a fun watch for a rainy weekend or something though
the only thing that drew me to this show other than playing the fallout games was walton goggins and kyle maclachlan the trailer for this series looked very promising but ended up being deceiving the story alone is very predictable with no effort to put certain twist on events along with jaw dropping cliffhangers just flat out boring i know that lucy is naive vaultdweller i dont need to be reminded all  episodes i know that maximus is a scared man seeking acceptance from the brotherhood of steel move it along the ghouls story was the most impressive story throughout the series other than that it was just ehhh cgi was absolutely disgusting and disrespectful to the art of film stop using that trash when you have talented makeup artist that need work please forgive me for this but dont make a season 
i just had to write a review about fallout in case people were on the fence on whether to watch it or not this is an absolute masterpiece from the storytelling to the cinematography beautifully crafted and made me really engaged in this world that was created being a game adaption i honestly had my doubts because i have always seen halo and no thanks that series disappointed so muchthis is a must watch series i couldnt fault it i watched the entire season  in one sitting started watching at approximately pm and finished into the early hours of the next morning it was that good i couldnt stop
i ended up binge watching the whole series within  hours i would say after the first episode i wasnt convinced that i would watch the whole series but actually it grew on meim a big fan of the fallout game franchise although i havent played it in a while i would recognise that its not easy converting a video game story into a tv series or a movie without disappointing fans a bit like the assassins creed moviethis one actually worked the action in the series the way injuries and kills happen in the series wouldnt work in a typical film or movie as its unrealistic only works in video games but they kept the video game effect in the series so it gets away with it but thats probably because im a fallout fan i wont recommend it to any nonfallout fans as they simply wont get iti dont usually watch tv series as i cant get into them anymore they require time and focus most series dont catch my full attention but this one didi hope we wont have to wait too long for a second season
fallout was one of my first games ever and played every single one of them im huge fanboy too and i cant believe those fanatics giving low ratings lol i was expecting something worse to be honest but other than some minor setbacks that can surely be ignored even newcomers can really enjoy this fun show yes for the newcomers this universe has a lot to take in and in the first glance it can be really really overwhelming and the show does not make a good job to ease you in it does it later on but they should have just start with war war never changes and explain the state of the world for the viewers to digest it in after a few episodes it really explains a lot expecially about the vault tec and the political social ethical spects about the universe but for an  episode series they should have done the explaining in  minutes and jump into the action its so goofy and cheesy and it doesnt take itself seriously like the games acting is great even though i was prepared to hate lucy but i didnt lol goggins is delight to watch as always maximus is an amazing character with a plenty of room to grow music is unbelievable designs are oscar worthy great production really captures the life in the vaults but it comes a little bit short when it comes to westlands but it will become better in s i hope screw the fanatic fanboys really just enjoy this beauty
so first off been a fallout fan actually since wastelandi went into this show with low expectations based on the plummet the games have seen recentlyi noticed it only had one major actor i know walton gogginswithout spoiling much the first ep was awkwardhowever once things got going like in the real games it was dark and dirty outsidei enjoyed a good many nods to various games though out of base contexti liked the usage of pipboy which was a staple in gamesthe fx are weird some are good some seem a bit cheap but ok for a showthe thing that makes this show a  to me is even though they screw up a lot they make up with fun characters and good recoveriesso many videogame or any other media based shows are just filler with little elsei am looking forward to the next season
as someone who lived through the period in which the film industry tended to transform the beloved game series like resident evil doom and others into films and television programs and how bad and horrific were those works that were made without soul and without passion and did not contain the spirit of the games from which they were made except for the series the last of us so i wasnt excited about this series and i didnt even want to watch it but i said lets give it a chance and i was really impressed starting from the surprising title of the first episode and the very wonderful story that never leaves you bored of it due to the unexpected events and the exciting progression of the story this story can be described as completely nonvulgar it is an ideal story with a smooth progression of events in addition to the good transition between stories as well as the transition between the past and the present which does not leave you with any kind of disorientation and distraction as for the characters the acting was very convincing in fact i loved all the characters and i loved how the story gave depth to each character i also liked the seriousness and bloodiness of the series and how this stagnation and seriousness was broken with some wonderful black comedy that did not spoil the seriousness of the shot i was also impressed by the quality of photography and the background music that suits every scene i also liked the nature of the conflict between capitalism and communism in the series and how it companies greed can literally drive them crazy this series is an example of a series that did not rely only on the name of the game in order to succeed but rather relied on creating a beautiful story with wonderful acting and a clear identity for the game i am very excited for the second season and i cannot wait to watch it
i really enjoyed fallout the acting is great the story unfolds gradually right up until the last episode lucy is a great character she retains her goodness even though she gradually does worse and worse thingsmaximus is a great baddygoodyhis character is not that likeable but he kind of becomes a better person through the season the ghoul is a great baddie and his cowboy vibe is a great addition to the showi wasnt able to predict much of the story there were surprise twists but it was still believable in a post apocalyptic scenariowith three storylines unfolding at the same time it keeps you engagedi really hope there are lots more seasons
i wanted to love this show i really did the trailer looked awesome however i was left disappointed and a little bit frustrated my rating would be a  if the site would let me do partial stars i think the raving reviews come from people who have played the game and watched the show through rose tinted glasses i can see how watching it through the lense of nostalgia may make it seem better than it is because in reality its a just ok show spoilers below they spent so much time on the exposition and yet dont show a lot of important things the climax is condensed into the last episode and the resolution is what like a  minutesthe last episode didnt have a huge impact there were some interesting twists and revelations but still it lacked the wow factor because i didnt really care about the charactersi realised after episode one that i didnt like it that much but i kept watching in hopes of the show improving by ep  i still didnt care about any of the characters none of them seemed likable to me in the last episode lucy has this big emotional scene and it wasnt that moving for me and im that person who cries at movies even in the cinema that revelation and science had sooo much potential if the show had built the character better had made lucy more rounded and made the viewer really care about herlucy and maximus have no chemistry they show so little of them together and dont spend enough time showing their relationship the kiss scene felt so awkward and forced because of the lack of feeling the vibes i got from them is comradery and friendship at mostmaximus is a weird character hes full of contradictions and i just dont like him he has some redeeming qualities but he kind of just stumbles into situations without doing much hes too passive i dont understand his motivation hes just weirdthe ghoul was at least interesting inwas curious about his story because the show spends a lot of time showing his past what happened tonhim how did he end up like this i was very much looking forward to finding those out but the show doesnt explain it yet maybe in slucy is ok i feel like the actor did her best with the material she was given its just that they didnt give the character enough dimension i understand she is supposed to be naive but that cant be her whole personalitynorm is sooo unlikeable i also dont understand how old hes supposed to be he looks  and  at the same time and its unsettling his character is the worst at least he grows a couple of vertebrae towards the end not a full backbone but maybe c to ci liked the dog the mosti had high hopes for the show and maybe too high expectations i expected the last of us quality and it did not meet that expectation i went into it without having played the game or knowing the lore just like with the last of us and i think that show is one of the best a  for mebut as one other reviewers said its ok to like the show even if its not perfect and at the end of the day its just a show i dont think it deserves the  rating but hey maybe for someone this is the best show theyve ever seen and had an amazing time watching it and thats fine its not the worst bit not that good i just expected better
within the first episode you can tell the quality of the production is excellent incredible sets and props combine with a well written story line supported by a very talented cast for a visual feast that does not fail to entertain ella purnell is perfectly cast as lucy and brings a solid performance to the role walter goggins is a gifted actor and fulfills the role of the ghoul with his own personal flair the supporting cast has a wide scope of talent with a long list of quality credits to their namesoverall i found this to be a show that is well written well produced and well cast it stands in a class with series like see silo into the badlands and the last of useven if this genre isnt typically on your list i highly recommend giving fallout a view the story presentation itself warrants a watch and the visuals are sorry for the cliché a true feast for the eyes👍 👍
i dont know the games and i dont know if thats an advantage or a disadvantage for judging the show  anyway the show offers solid entertainment with some funny moments the production is topnotch for a tv show and the cast is solid too what annoys me the most is the soundtrack  not necessarily the music itself but in my opinion too many scenes are unnecessarily underscored with music that often doesnt fit whats being shown and it sometimes really gets on my nerves  less is more so to say other than that if you dont expect too much youll get wellproduced trash without great aspirations popcorn cinema for the right kind of audience  i enjoyed the ride but for sure fallout is not a masterpiece like so many reviewers claim but way better than halo or the last of us
the cast unattractive men a strong independent woman who deals with raiders at level  and a couple of veterans like kyle maclachlan and michael emersonthere is no chemistry between the characters everyone who couldve carried this piece of art appears for  minutes at most a vault dweller sees the ocean for the first time and shows zero emotions with the phrase okeydokey stanislavski gives a standing ovationabsolutely everyone wears clean clothes in any situation the locations and props are either restored from the video games without imagination or are similar to modern times except that they painted burning debris here and there clowning  fan service and  fixation on sex the series leaves you with the feeling that the script was written by a teenager with sperm toxicity who overplayed fallout 
this show is incredible it hits everything you could possibly want from a show about fallout you have wacky weapons great lines fun characters and absolutely insane revelations this show gave me absolutely everything i wanted from it and i couldnt have possibly asked for more i have an issue with most new shows where they have to have an insufferable character who plays no role other than beying as annoying as humanly possible this show subverted my expectations and made every character interesting and enjoyable to see on screen my only issue is that we didnt get answers on how moldaver has survived the last  years or so shes not a ghoul or a synth given her death if she truly died at the end of the season i would have given this show a  if they hadnt needlessly left this unansweredi think theyve masterfully brought this world into a tv series and i dont think ive ever been more excited for a season  i genuinely hope they bring this show back
i just finished watching episode  and this was one of those series that left me feeling a bit sad that there is no more to see as of nowi have to say i am partially biased since ive played every game from fallout  to now replayed them and doing some lore readingbefore i saw the first episode i was a bit worried that this could be a show that was just made for the fans with little passion to the whole world and stories of fallout but after i started watching i realized that the director studio and everyone involved have given this production their whole hearts and minds to make this a perfect series to not just get approval by the fallout fans but to also breed a new generation of fallout maniacs i will not be surprised if this show bumps up fallout game sales a loti am happy they wrote a completely new story for this show and they left a bit of bones tho chew on for us that loved the gamesi dont wanna dig in too much about the story and the characters because i want everybody i know to watch this so please see this if you want a different extremely well produced show with great acting talentnolan and joy do not mess around or live on hope they make it surgically perfect to the last detail
one of the biggest mistakes you can make when adapting a film is to reject the original media and instead make your own unrelated story with a completely different feel inside the universe what fallout did was exactly the oppositewhat i love most about this tv show is that it effectively balances between the dark comedy and serious events that the original games had theres also some fun subtle nods to a whole range of things that have been moved into the show from the game whether that be the weapons or even the armour shop in the second episodeof course the show wouldnt be complete without the music and what i really enjoyed about ramin djawadis music was that it encapsulated the soundtrack of the original fallout games as considering a lot of music score for film now is more zimmery ambience and sound design based its refreshing to hear some more orchestral works
what a great adaptation to the fallout games i was hoping the series would be good and it is great characters and great cinematographyi dont know what upset the fallout fanbase im one of them and cant see anything wrong with what i just saw all weapons are there suits the vaults everything is fallout the only thing missing is deathclaws and that will definitely come in the next seasonsgreat to see that they didnt follow a story from the game but created a new story a new story that can lead to many directions covered by many series and im looking forward to what will followwar never changes
this has to be the best series ive ever seen based on a gametruly gripping gore and bloodshed with a plot that always had me guessingtotally unpredictableloved it and certainly looking forward to season honestly cant say a bad word about this series the sets wasnt cgi and you can see a lot of time and effort has gone into making thisi dont know what else to say just this is making me write  words and i have said everything i needed tothat being said just watch it and i can assure you you will not be disappointedenjoy be ready to binge the whole series haha bye
"another great video gametoseries adaptation that proves why the vast landscape of games cannot be adequately captured in a  hour movieits accomplishments
it requires absolutely no prior knowledge about the games to enjoy the storycreates a brand new post apocalyptic world for tv that implements the unique retrofuture aesthetic of the game with great successcompelling characters with complex moral compasses that perfectly suit the worldjust the right amount of unexpected well implemented comedic moments that are handled masterfullyhas that westworldlike mysterious conspiracy floating in the air thing that i personally couldnt get enough ofconsidering ive only finished fallout  and played about  of fallout  i personally felt that the series is better than the games 🙈will play new vegas next and then my opinion might change lets see"
so yeah  episodes in i felt like i needed a break ill probably finish the season in the very near future but i cant binge this the fallout world building is just not my cup of tea silly alternative universe with rediculous s tech space marines mutants and a happygolucky attempt at funny approach to grotesque the approach to the human mind and psyche is skin deep at bestdisclaimer while im a gamer i havent played the fallout games although i know the theme and what theyre mostly about so nothing in the show was really surprising or new its probably a good show especially in light of the original material  fans of the games will definitely love it probably rightly so as well cause while its not for me even i can tell this is well done im not sure its going to have a much broader appeal and staying power in the general populace thoughfor me whats annoying at this point is all the hype especially from journalists who keep talking about this show along with the last of us a show that has been lauded by gamers and nongamers alike this show fallout is nowhere near the masterful artwork that tlou tv series is its a joke and a glaring issue with the rating system that they have the same rating although one with k ratings and one with k these shows should not be compared because no matter what tlou will come out on top in every possible comparison related to story and quality im sure some will object and disagree vehemently but come on  be real take a step back and assess from an objective distanceim not trying to make enemies or piss people off here hehe sorry i know fanboy are protective just want to let others especially nongamers know that if theyve seen glowing reviews and come expecting another tlou they might be a bit disappointed so curb your expectations a bit maybe think the boys more than the last of us you might just really enjoy yourself if you dont take it too seriously
"this was an amazing show everything was beautifully written the characters were intriguing the plot was captivating but only  episodes why there was enough to make this a full season now how long do i have to wait for season   years for just another  episodes idkseems like a lot of build up just to be disappointed by such a long wait for half a seasonnow the obligatory gibberish to make the character requirement
lalalalalalalalalalalallalalalalamalamamamamlalalalalamalamamlalalalalalalalalalalalallalalalalalalalalalalslsmsmeijskskakakakkalalalalalalalalalalalalalalaaamamamsm"
this was a passion to make for a lot of people and you can tell i was completely engrossed the entire time and loved the attention to detail fans of the game series will pick up all the easter eggs and call backs new people to the lore should enjoy the world building and fascinating characters meanwhile the story archs and characters are firmly rooted in legitimate takes on human nature each characters is worth examining and discussing at length and the performances by the actors really brought the wasteland to life i think one of the big factors in making a good story in the days of ai writing and overly fast productions is maintaining the authenticity and real human emotions that people pour into the source material fallout was able to maintain that orginal link from the first and later game writers to the show at least in their intent to convey the story authentically a problem when translating one media to another like game to show or book to movie is that the imagery and content are portrayed but message or underlying philosophy gets missed i felt like fallout was successful in making a point we need more media that can articulate a point
im an old school fallout fan meaning i appreciate more the black isle studios era of the game i watched the series but it felt a bit like it was written by ai many memberberries to please gaming community showcasing game mechanics which is out of place in the tv show bullet time stimpacks etc scenario is very gamey which is to be expected on one hand but lackluster on the other as this is not the same media or experiencecharacters maximus strikes me as finn  and writing are quite superficial enough for a game but could be better for a dramaseries humor is supposed to be dark and witty  think monty python easter eggs harold sulik terminal logs and to me it comes out short  to banal and too shallowtoo many irrelevant boring and repeated scenes too little character buildingdrama exception being cooper howard  scenario is also a bit awkward as it is placed too far into the future to be plausible  or so years after fallout  and within same geographic region whatever happened to the water chip
fallout could have been great could have been epic but i cant help feeling they missed the boat i think they made two huge mistakes in this seriesfirst  they failed to introduce the world as a fallout superfan i get it all but others wont they will see silliness and zaniness without explanation and it will turn people offthey should have had the entire first season take place within the vault as a primer through that lens we could have learned about the vaults the war and the surface raiders ghouls bottlecaps as currency why the music is all s and all the retro things about fallout despite the advanced tech laserguns drugs and food that doesnt spoil why a stimpack heals her stab wound etc we could have learned about the world in an academic antiseptic way while having some tension within the vault as the season  story culminating with the opening of the vault door as the finale that would make the jarring change between seasons real for the viewer just like it is for the protagonist as we see the differences between the book learning of the vault and the real worldbarring that at least  episodes in the vault doing the same everything feels so rushed in this tellingsecond  they needed to tone down the silliness of the games and take it slightly more seriously yes it can be a bit campy and such but slightly more muted than the games seems they went the other way insteadthe writing is ok the acting is ok and so far the series is well ok not great not terrible it could have been great
you can tell that a lot of love was put in the show if you are a fan of the game you will not stop smiling at every scene whoever did this they knew the word that they would be working from the vistas the colors the music the costumes everything is screaming fallout it keeps raising the tone until the last episode when the teases become the real thing i wont spoilbasically as someone who played all games and not only playing but reading the lore spread in the game as a kid i would think for myself how they didnt make a show about this already they have everything written already just pick a spot a vault and some main quest and you are setguess what  its what they didim genuinely happy with this show and its plotif you are crying about some of the old factions being dead i have news for you warwar never changes
whats great about fallout is that you can go completely blind into it not having played the video games and youll still understand everything and be immersed in the world and story being told for those whove played the games its real treat seeing the world and all the lorerelated things come to life on the tv screen the set designs are impressive the cgi is solid and the attention to detail is on point this is a show that does justice to the games while also telling its own unique story if youve played the games you can tell they did their research and really tried to emulate the style and feel of the world the aesthetic the look the feel the tone  they nailed it all it felt very surreal to watch a video game world come to life in live action so seamlessly the cinematography and lighting is top notch and definitely elevates the whole experience the music done by the same guy who did the music for game of thrones ramin djawadi did a great job with the scorewalton goggins is iconic and amazing as the ghoul his characters arc was really interesting to watch ella purnell did a fantastic job playing lucy lucy is the definition of how you write a strong female character woke hollywood can learn a few things from this show her charm her humor and those big pretty eyes really sell it lucys character development was one of the best seeing her go through her tough journey growing as a person and character while also discovering the truth was insanely satisfying to watch its not only how you write an interesting and compelling female character lead but its also how you write any great character arc everyones a beautifully flawed character and it works especially in the world of fallout we get to see how far someone is willing to go in order to get what they wantthe storytelling is probably one of the most compelling and amazing things about the show it reminded me a lot of the way pulp fiction is told the way it jumps around to different characters stories and the way it goes back and forth from the present to the past and back again really great storytelling going here the acting is top notch never once did it feel corny lame or phony the one thing that can be a bit over the top at times is the blood and violence it can be quite brutal but you gotta remember this show is based on a game where getting a perfectly placed headshot on an enemy makes their head explode into a million fleshy pieces and you also gotta remember the post apocalyptic messed up world in which it takes place in a lot of times they use these super violent moments as a way of injecting a bit of dark humor  and it works the humor in this show reflects the dark humor in the gameoverall i was unexpectedly impressed and satisfied by fallout i went into it with no expectations hoping that it would be great and it turned out to be something amazing its an incredibly wellmade and put together show thats worth watching regardless if youve played the games or not highly highly recommend it
as someone who played fallout fallout  fallout new vegas fallout  and fallout shelter  the review bombs need to be addressed no where was it stated that bethesda or anyone else admitted to or stated that the show would follow the video game titles timeline or synopsis a whole bunch of nonsense was generated online and social media about this and people just gulped it up under the guise  well its on the internet it must be trueha sureanyways im at the halfway point of the series and i am impressed just the way it is its refreshing sometimes when you get a different portrayal that a rehashed timeline you are already so used to you could recite it in your sleepfallout is a wonderful transition from video game to physical acting concept it kept the mainline of events of nuclear holocaust and living in a strange but familiar world devastated by the power of the atomignore the reviews bombs
one of the best things about fallout is discovering the reason behind the vaults and those who pioneered its creation it starts out as surface dwellers are evil barbaric and crazy while the vault dwellers are civil and well mannered but this isnt entirely the case i havent played the games so slowly discovering the truth was a rewarding experience for me lucy and maximus are great and their journey is interesting but the ghoul is the one who piqued my interest the most what happened to his wife and daughter theyre clearly both still alive and how on earth did he survive for  years the reunion between the ghoul and his wife is something to look forward too as she betrayed him by lying to him about the vaults and the bombs speaking of ghouls whats with feral ghouls annd chicken 😂 anyways the ghouls are pretty human until they turn feral annd then theyre zombie like i mean what apocalyptic story is complete without zombies then theres norm lucys cowardly brother whose acts of courage reveal so much to us the apocalypse is filled with strange and interesting characters and fallout fully embraces thattheres a lot about vaulttec that hasnt been uncovered and i honestly wish i could get a season  right now
i wasnt expecting this show at all and i loved it i hope to see the next season of it to know whats coming next i really want to see what would happen to lucy to the ghoul i mean wow it was amazing of a show and now i wanna play the game maybe some time the thing is im waiting for the continuation really excited i recommend this to many people talking a bit about it all the setting and the story of every character was really perfect ive played the game a little bit just a bit and i see the world really well constructed  my final comment is just a big wow for this show love
amazon nailed it this time what didnt work at all with rings of power works perfectly with this gaming adaptation fallout promises an exciting journey through postapocalyptic worlds starting with the consistently good casting you get a truly consistent and believable albeit twisted world presented here ella purnell stands out particularly positively perfectly fitting into the role of competent and motivated yet highly naive vaultdweller lucy with her large doe eyes walton goggins as the mysterious cowboy the horror and gore elements are gross but fitting even without knowing the games the series is truly outstanding can wholeheartedly recommend want more of it immediately
this is really bad if you are a fan of the game do not watch this pure la morally superior preachy crap everyone that watches this isnt a gamer this is terrible i wanted it to be good so bad because i love the game but it is absolutely horrible i watched to the end just because i thought somehow it would recover you are wasting your life if you watch this bs everyone is talking about this like its a good gamer film false the new mk is a good gamer film assassins creed was pretty damn good this nonsense is so into itself its pathetic its preachy its vain and it has nothing to do with the game
created by geneva roberts and graham wagner for amazon prime we follow lucy maclean ella purnell an underground vault dweller hundreds of years after nuclear war has destroyed most the surface of the globe a story familiar for fans of the games lucy must adventure to the surface to rescue her father and discover what kind of civilization is left intact in the irradiated monsterridden world above as a show there are considerable shortcomings but ultimately quite a good time a franchise based around heavy world building the show hits the ground running introducing us to the lore and the backstory through the lens of  or so characters in places and times again for those already familiar with the games this rapid catchup may seem fine however a series introduction the opening is considerably blocky with strange pacing and frankly weird dialogue as someone who has played much of the games theres a lot to be said on the production choices around which were to give that video game feel however i dont like many of those choices personally characters only interacts as if its a bethesda engine lots of standing and talking sitting and talking or walking and talking characters never have business or things to practically do in scenes and the opposite during any scenes of movement or action montages we get basically zero dialogue sometimes for minutes at a time if really does feel like watching a video game at points in a subtle way the bad firstperson scenes in the new halo adaptation didnt even capture however these choices may certainly appeal to some and they certainly seem to totally fair there are also tons of references to things across all the games which was neat although ascetically its of course continuing into the heavier saturation todd howard version of the fallout universe most prominent now in the styles of the games  and shelter which again of course makes sense as he serves as a producer some practical props were hit and miss as was the cgi things in scenes and backgrounds tended to look great however hero props the characters actually held were often very cardboard  rubber looking and i dont wanna talk about the deaging cgi narratively as we progress the series improves although as story twist after story twist comes especially towards the end i didnt mind them they just rarely felt justified by what lead up to it that said the set pieces and wardrobe are all great i was extremely impressed acting is all suitable purnell as lucy was good i of course loved walton goggins performance ultimately a pretty fun story that does eventually come together once it gets going although i expect may be a bit confusing or lacking for those completely unfamiliar with the lore from the games i liked it didnt love it but will definitely check out the next season whenever that comes
as a fan with combined of hrs across all fallout games i have a huge smile watching this as jonathan nolan understands what fallout truly is after the the last of us dissapointment its truly refreshing to have a director who actually has had a fallout addiction just as we fans and it translates beautifully to the tv screenyou have three storylines brought together in funny and goofy ways just as it should be ella purnell as the naive vault dweller walton goggins as the ghoul and aaron moten as the glorious brotherhood of steel squire these  absolutely nail their roles and bring out the subtle details from the game all the way from their skillsperks to their personality and it actually feels like we are following fallout charactersthe world is dreadful but beautiful filled with abominations and silliness dark humor with a sense of danger at every corner this is the best video game adaptation ever made easily by a mile and will definitely make you interested in the games
"a harsh review though i might have come back from seeing dune  gets better after episode the intrigue in flashback scenes are great but that doesnt mean the rest is which is the main bulk of the storyplot follows the main actress as she learns the harsh way of the surface and below her brother as he questions life in the vault we follow a man gone rogue from a militant faction and his life choices and finally an ex human now ghoul travel the wastelands by his lonesomecoincidences galore and gore galorestarts like many sheltered societies after a devastating event silo raised by wolves snowpiercer and the mystery unfolds
though those shows are more interestingtrivia the font of main title are from the fallout games"
as someone who has played fo   and new vegas they nailed the tone and world buildingas someone who likes actually good writing this show fell flat on its face hardoddly enough the storytelling here was relatively solid good characterization the tone as mentioned a nice blend of cartoonish dark humor and gritbut in a rare twist of modern literature its the plot that is a problem the plot became so nonsensical by the end that it wrecked the first half of the seriesfirst the reveal of how vault  operate means that hank must have known of the destruction of  yet he let in the raiderssecond moldaver and hank had history and he still let in the raidersthird the show simply handwaves how moldaver who had a massive falling out with vault tech somehow survived  yearsfourth hank nuked  nuked  a whole city because his wife ran away a hard pill to swallow and a bridge to far when you remember hes been in cryo for  years and underground his whole life snap nukethere plot issues that exist after you sit and think about it and then theres issues that make you stop in the middle of the show and make you rewatch the foundational pieces to make sure you didnt miss somethingfallout is squarely in the latter categorywhile there is enough in the show to enjoy the journey it wants to tell a cohesive story and it does not its not a series of side quests that brings the show way down in my bookif you can overlook foundational concerns like this youll enjoy the show
ive never heard or played the game i started watching based on the reviews and i was simply blown away the series keeps you on your edge and captivated through a really deep and surprising storyline that keeps you guessing every single episode there are no fillers  the plot is interesting through and through also there are no smoke and mirrors just to keep you guessing like some shows that change the plot for the sake of change and stretch it out like bubble gum eg lostcharacter build up is great  the protagonists all have interesting storylines and plots and yes of course theres action and plenty of gore as is fitting for an apocalyptic series this aint no love moviethe setting also blew me away probably more familiar to those whove played the games a mix of advanced technology together with nostalgic times  they dont have iphones and tv are black and white i wont add so as not to spoilnote that it does have plenty of gore and dark humor wouldnt recommend for young kids if youre not a very young kid  go watch it now
been an avid fallout player since the waterchip broke in fallout the suspense and whirlwind of feelings i had waiting to see how prime would handle the task of transferring fallout to the tvscreen has been a rollercoasterthe series deliver with a cast that surely shows the importance of a good casting directorthe scenery and environment was so well done there surely would be an oscar in the waiting if this was a movie adaptationi dont think i have seen such good cgi in a tvseries ever only think i reacted to was the young version of overseer hankfollowing the different storylines was a real treat and the occasional humorous additions was spot onthe only negative thing is now i have a long wait until season  never wanted a kryo tube this bad
im a huge fan of the games i played fallout    in the s and fallout  new vegas and  later on new vegas is my favorite but i love them all yes even  i only briefly played tactics and never tried anyway this show is actually way better than i expected it absolutely nails the tone of the games the production design is fantastic some of the actual filmmaking is a little mixed with a few scenes struggling when it comes to basic blocking and framing but overall this is top tier work with a great cast walton goggins is a standout this is one of his best roles theres some really nice character writing too and actual character growthi know theres been some controversy with the changes made to the lore especially in the last episode but i actually think they handled it well making the revelations near the end a satisfying character moment with some real emotional stakes to it this isnt a perfect show of course but theres wayyyy more to like than not like and as a fan of the games im genuinely surprised how well this turned out the production values are decent the character writing and casting is great and the tone is spot on thats all i can ever ask for from an adaptation or continuation of something i lovewould love to see games like bioshock mass effect deus ex dishonored and halflife get the same sort of treatment
fallout has always been one of my absolute favorite video games series of all time and this show did not disappoint from start to finish i was hooked and it genuinely felt like the shows curators understood the assignment i cannot wait for season two and honestly the only negative thing i can say about the show is it was too short very much looking forward to watching this season a few more times to look for any fun little easter eggs i missed the first time around if you love the games or just enjoy crazy post apocalyptic type of shows this one is perfect and i cannot recommend it enough
ill be the first to admit that i was expecting a let down especially with hollywoods recent track record of going ballistic on any ip they get their hands onthis then being a videogame adaptation which are usually ranging from utter failure to let downs the stage was set to this being just another one of the bunchbut apparently someones been doing their homework because they actually managed to create a pretty decent story in the fallout lore and also deliver a visually authentic experience to go hand in hand with the writingnow this isnt the greatest show ever conceived by all means but what it set out to deliver it delivered it wellall the actors had done great job with their roles special shout out to ella purnell and walton goggins as the standoutsthe music was absolutely spot on simply due to them being literally ripped out of the games so the nostalgia hits any fan instantlyand last but not least to avoid spoilers the show full of a vault worth easter eggs for the fans to findif they can keep this momentum and attention to detail for a few more seasons this could actually go down as the best videogame adaptation to date
i cant say it was bad the world was really well done the graphics were more then greatthe story is just so unbelievably bad and slow its a tough watch after  episodesafter watching half the season you get your action drama and dark stuff but the story wont progress at allit feels like you are stuck in the desert for  hoursthe acting was great maximuss acting i wasnt a big fan of but cant all be perfect regarding thati just wish wed actually see more of the fallout world but instead its just small glimpses giving u small tastes of what it could be and its utterly disappointing not reaching that climax
i have played most of the fallout games and really like the series when i first heard about this i wasnt too sure how to feel about it the film industry is famous for not keeping true to the source material or inserting their own agenda into the filmswith that being said i found the show to be better than expected but there are some areas i found lackingquality on production is great however there are several scenes throught the season where the film locations look just like other locations in different episodes also many of the scenes make the wasteland feel small in comparison to the open world gamei also felt like the dialogue was weak in areas another annoyance was seeing characters both background and main characters both make terrible choices choices that are so bad they would have to intentionally make the bad choice because doing anything else would have been better i dont want to give any spoilers but you will notice when you watch if you havent alreadyit seems like several scenes that occurred only did so to drive story which didnt feel needed as the story was simple and straight forwardoverall if your a fan of the series or post apocalyptic genre fan or just looking for something light you may get enjoyment out of it if your looking for a series more engaging with a better script and sensibility then you may want to look elsewhere
over the last ish years there have been a lot of movie adaptations of video games and more recently series based on games this is without a doubt the best adaptation i have seen great writing great acting great set design and overall aesthetic they obviously spent a lot of time making sure that they got it right its funny dramatic intense and completely engrossing definitely a huge achievement for the genre and something for others to aspire to when adapting a game to tvmovie i binged the whole season nonstop and it was time well spent i recommend this to everyoneyou dont need to have played the game to enjoy this show
ive loved the fallout universe since the first game postapocalyptic but not quite scifi the show really nailed the scene and supplied a decent plot but some of the acting and dialogue was justoff and dry as the wasteland itself it also tried to inject too much humor  fallout is a more serious game but the show keeps trying to make us laughi really want to like the show so well see if i can make it through the whole thing at least they got the general feeling right from the general item names to the various groups of people it just seems like they shouldve hired some better writers
"disclosure i know nothing about the game nor do i care about the game i watched this with no clue and no expectationsso obviously its for teens gamers viewers who like robotey things and senseless violence im not offended or grossed out its just all kind of sillythis reminded me alot of s tank girl but longer slower and more dramatic none in a good way not saying that lori petty movie was great but it was quick and fun for what it was
this is not a good show it jumps around between groups environments slowly tries to bring in a plotmaybe the underground bunkered people are afraid to go to the surfacewhere people seem to be living just fine huhi guess its just not interesting enough for me to continue past the first couple of episodes stars instead of  for the cool scifi angle"
fallout the  film adaptation of the iconic video game series takes viewers on a rollercoaster ride through a postapocalyptic landscape that at first feels overwhelming but gradually becomes endearing directed by jonathan nolan and lisa joy the movie captures the essence of the game while creating a unique cinematic experience that stands on its own for those unfamiliar with the game like myself the initial experience might seem peculiar but persistence pays off as the narrative and characters begin to resonate deeplyat the outset fallout can be disorienting the film thrusts viewers into a desolate world ravaged by nuclear war where remnants of humanity struggle to survive amidst mutated creatures and hostile factions the visual aesthetic is stark and grim echoing the desolation and chaos of a world where civilization has crumbled the barren landscapes dilapidated buildings and eerie silence can feel overwhelming and bizarre especially for those who have not been immersed in the games lorehowever as the story progresses the initial sense of bewilderment gives way to fascination the film follows the journey of the protagonist played by walton goggins a lone wanderer navigating this treacherous new world goggins portrayal of the protagonist is compelling he brings a rugged charisma and depth to the character making his struggle for survival relatable and engaging his interactions with other characters including the enigmatic ghoul played by ella purnell and the resourceful scavenger portrayed by kyle maclachlan add layers of complexity to the narrativeone of the films strengths lies in its character development initially the characters might appear as mere archetypes in a dystopian setting but as the plot unfolds their backstories motivations and relationships come to the fore purnells character in particular evolves from a mysterious figure to a pivotal part of the protagonists journey revealing a rich history and a poignant vulnerability maclachlans scavenger on the other hand brings a touch of dark humor and resilience adding depth and diversity to the ensemble castthe movie also excels in its worldbuilding the directors have meticulously crafted a universe that feels both expansive and intimate the attention to detail in the set design costumes and special effects creates an immersive experience that draws viewers deeper into the story the depiction of various factions from the ruthless raiders to the enigmatic brotherhood of steel adds layers of intrigue and conflict enriching the narrative tapestryanother highlight is the films soundtrack composed by ramin djawadi the music perfectly complements the films tone ranging from hauntingly melancholic melodies that underscore the desolation of the wasteland to more upbeat adventurous tunes that accompany the protagonists journey djawadis score enhances the emotional impact of key scenes making the viewing experience more immersive and memorablefallout is not without its flaws the pacing in the first act can be slow and the dense exposition might feel heavyhanded for those unfamiliar with the source material however these minor drawbacks are overshadowed by the its strengths the narratives gradual unfolding allows for a deeper connection with the characters and the world they inhabit making the eventual payoff all the more satisfyingin conclusion fallout is a film that rewards patience and engagement for those willing to stick with it the initial strangeness transforms into a captivating and emotionally resonant experience the richly developed characters immersive worldbuilding and evocative soundtrack come together to create a movie that stands out in the crowded landscape of video game adaptations whether youre a fan of the game or a newcomer to the franchise fallout offers a unique and compelling cinematic journey that will grow on you with each passing moment
first of all i would like to highlight that i havent play the game i just knew for its existence so my review is based clearly on the serie and nothing elseim a fan of the vintage vibe i love everything of the  i also love movies and series that refers to a postapocalyptic world so as you understand this serie its the best combination for me and it didnt disappoint me at all its a very well made the production is amazing i loved the cinematography and the music of the  you get definitely to the mood which i believe is the half of the serie the acting of the cast is also good nothing special but yet not disappointed as i know there will be another season and im glad for it because not all of your questions are get an answer its a kind of a serie that will make you play the game eventually and as i heard the sales of the game have been increased after the launch of the seriei would definitely recommend to watch it either you played the game or not
the show is incredible truly ive played several of the fallout games and its impeccably crafted to mirror the origin world of the games whatever genius suggested walton goggins this role nailed it damn his work just creeps up on you and grows from boyd crowder to sherrif chris mannix to baby billy freeman and now the ghoul cooper howard is right in his channel of forte its a sort of cringe to look but you have to watch i only have the suggestion for this show to craftily bring in the missing death claws and super mutants and youll get a hardline  one of the two best recreations of a fabricated world ever i think the details stand tall  solid creating in a class i can only compare to the last of us the depth is correct in all the right ways in the last episode i almost died when the robot said wait wait wait i wont answer your questions unless you let me inject you with this keep this show rolling dont make us wait years to see the rest of whats coming
from start to finish this is very good the characters are super cool to watch and the story makes them progress very well also the ghoul is one of the coolest characters in general i also thought norms storyline was more interesting and i was more invested in his story all the way until the final episode or soalso watching the ghoul in both the wasteland and prebomb was super coolanother one of my favorite things is the world design it just feels like fallout even all the things that would normally feel goofy in other shows just feel normal in this worldthis is definitely one of my favorite series to come out recently
"my experience with fallout through the years was by playing the games fallout new vegas being the game that brought me into the franchise its set in the same state as this show california which also featured prominently in fallout  and  lore wise both before and after the apocalypse it was just the right choice by the showrunners and producers to place it in los angeles california graham wagner and geneva robertsondworet served as showrunners for the show penning the scripts for episode  then there were a couple of other writers which deserves praise kieran fitzgerald chaz hawkins and gursimran sandhu the creators and crew behind this tv show respected the source material the games with even todd howard aboard as producer along with jonathan nolan and lisa joy with nolan directing the first three episodes thus setting the tone for whats to come like michael mann did with tokyo vice for example other notable directors were clare kilner and frederick e o toye along with wayne yip who directed the finale these people created something truly special and perfect what i would call one of the best adaptations of video games its an original story but set in the same universe something the last of us and halo never did these writers and producers of fallout could have played it safe and done something similar as they would have had free rein to do anything they wanted to without the need of involving the games and all lore behind it they truly nailed the attention to detail from the set design to the world building the overall production design and everything placed on the scene truly incredible miseenscene by the directors visually fallout is spectacular with incredible cinematography and gorgeous looking visual effects combined with practical effects the makeup and prosthetics for the ghoul for example along with all the sets built for the show like red rocket and superduper mart which comes to mind the cinematographers who worked on the showseason was
stuart dryburgh who helmed four and teodoro maniaci who helmed the other four i think dryburghs cinematography was the best and his resume the piano the pilot episode for boardwalk empire and the painted veil speaks for itself hell probably get nominated for fallout too maniaci was also incredible creating some iconic shots for the last two episodesthe show depicts the aftermath of the great war of  an apocalyptic nuclear exchange in an alternate history of earth where advances in nuclear technology after wwii led to the emergence of a retrofuturistic society and a subsequent resource war flashforward to  this tv adaptation follows a young woman named lucy who leaves behind her home in vault  to venture out into the dangerously unforgiving wasteland of a devastated los angeles to look for her father along the way she meets a brotherhood of steel squire and a ghoul bounty hunter each with their own mysterious pasts and agendas to settleoriginal fallout lead tim cain appreciated the performances and storytelling but singled out how the show nailed the fallout vibe as its biggest achievement i was just looking at all the props he said of one scene i realized after a few minutes went by that i had not followed the dialogue at all because i was so engrossed by it visually and i couldnt agree more hearing this from one of the creators of the original fallout games just makes me smile the performances and storytelling are truly some of the highlights the comedic tone combined with ultraviolence was handled perfectly as it was close to the games the show also had a serious tone but the important thing is how everything felt natural and never strange to the viewers eyes the storytelling overall writing and narrative was completely right for the tv show having us follow a vault dweller perfectly cast and a three dimensional character in her own right ella purnell as lucy maclean then there is the squire maximus of the brotherhood of steel also a great character and well cast played by aaron moten then we have walton goggins as the ghoul  cooper howard a great three dimensional antagonist which crosses the morally grey on multiple occasions thus becoming a protagonist in his own right thats the big three with stories from deuteragonists also theres also a big mystery surrounding the seasonshow of who took lucys father and who destroyed shady sands along with howard which is hunted by every faction and bounty hunters after escaping the enclave with something valuable meanwhile theres another story flashbacks more exactly which shows the ghoul back before the bombs hit when he was cooper howard and timeline wise this is far from anything we have seen before and it was just brilliantly executed in a way that didnt hurt the pacing only made it better because of how it ties into the main story with a stellar main cast of characters impossible not to like the supporting cast and guest stars are also great with names like sarita choudhury leslie uggams matt berry chris parnell and michael cristoferthe final episode  ties everything together nicely both timelines and well everything comes full circle in that said episode in its twists and so on having a lot of knowledge of the lore lots of things werent a shock but the shows big twist was unexpected and brilliant the writers and showrunners deserve a lot of praise for the last episode and the whole show the faithfulness to the source material and succeeding in telling a story in its vast universe it would have been nice if they would have released weekly episodes so you get to savor every minute of an episode in a day which would have felt special but instead we got all eight episodes and honestly i was happy for it but deep down i miss the whole weekly release and socializing which comes with it fallout is getting a second season and im here to stay for now im giving the first season my thumbs up its a spectacular season of television and possibly the best time ive had watching a tv series in a long time its a multi genre show and fallout does it perfectly nailing each genre simply a spectacular season of television"
having played the games the show follows the lore well whilst also being unique we have interesting characters all with their own traits and quirks whilst also having their own unique agendas the comedy had me laughing so hard my lungs felt like they were gonna fail especially after meeting some of the funniest wastelanders whilst the show has a funny twisted side to it it also has a dark gritty story and as you watch through youre left on the edge of your seat wondering what your protagonist are going to reveal next you dont need to have played the games to watch the show everything that needs explaining is explained throughout the story to help viewers who are new to the fallout worldoverall fallout plays all its cards right managing to combine its amazing characters hilarious comedy stunning sets violent nature of the postwar wasteland and keeping true the fallout theme of everything is not as it seems without seeming like a huge jokei cant recommend this show enough
the latest muchpublicized science fiction blockbuster series is fallout now streaming on prime and freevee without and with ads respectively both are from amazon it stars ella purnell as lucy maclean walter coggins as the mutant bandit ghoul and aaron moten as love interest maximus while it is getting a high rating of  on imdb i would rate it a barely watchable  the plot is that vaulttec a manufacturer of fallout shelters has conspired with other powerful interests to start a nuclear war in order to drive customers into its shelters some  years later the surface is inhabited by warring remnants of humanity as well as mutated monsters this series is based on a popular video game and feels as juvenile as one might therefore expect in spite of its multimillion dollar production it is not so much science fiction as it is one which is only a couple steps above being a zombie apocalypse film there are all sorts of plot holes eg how is it with surface obliterated back into the stone age electricity seems to be working in every abandoned building and hightech weaponry proliferates characters are stereotyped and inauthentic i also wearied of combining ultraviolent visuals with retro nostalgic singing i did watch all eight episodes but i think one must be a scifi or gaming addict to do so
nowadays as you know new gen getting more toxic people hate everything without reason this is the one of product people just hate randomly i dont like bethesda games and i didint want to watch this show but when i started this the one of the best adaptation and tv show nowadays extremely fun and gore and so many things i definitely enjoyed all episodes yes some part of script very bad yet still great shows if you are not capable to understand tv shows movies game just stop and go find different hobbies this world doesnt for you as i said people who rated lower than  dont believe it and just ignore those comments  is appropriate for this show
after binge watching all episode here is my honest review of season  of falloutive heard of the games but never got around to actually play them so my review is based with little to no influence from the gamesfallout is a decent and quite captivating series only let down by some bad main casting choices except goggins and sometimes wtf moments like that doctor not getting hit by a single bullet from a robot controlled sentry gatling gun that was outright the dumbest thing ive ever seen on screenepisodes  starts off slow and i felt at times i wanted to stop but i managed through and the flashback scenes actually help me keep my interest even more mainly because of coopers backstorythe series really kicks off from ep and i didnt feel like there was any kind of filler moments which really made the viewing experience much more to the pointi loved goggins character cooper and his backstory is really the drive in fallout actually the only character i cared and rooted forlucy on the other hand was meh at best her dialogue delivery felt sooo robotic character was fine and i like that they didnt make her to much of power girl and showed her moments of mistakesmaximus  i just didnt care for dude looks dumb founded half the time his squeaky voice doesnt fit his character at all and as of character development goes almost none btw i wish he developed a bit more to a badass after all he went through but no he remained the same all throughoh yeah  and dont get me started on that nonbinary character i almost turned it off when the pronouns came out but luckily her screen time is limited and is only in  episodeoverall fallout is a well made series with a intriguing plot and some decent vfx of what i know about the games this honestly might be the one of the best game to screen adaptation ive seen
"first of all let me start by saying i just rewatched twin peaks to watch another tv show after that is sort of like eating a big ice cream sundae right before dinnerbut it really helps to put it into perspective how bad this production is lets start from the first scenes of pre fallout world there is no time to feel suspense at all about impending doom we have no feelings for any of the characters we have five minutes of slow mo at a childrens birthday party its like the writers of the show are just saying how can we get there fastest and things are tossed into the script to serve a purpose for the writers a good writer could make an entire season about pre fallout worldwhy am i mentioning this because the entire show is like this this is the dialogue between writers
 people need to die 
 who
 i dont know write them into the script so that they can die it serves a function to get us to xbombs need to fall
how
who cares just make bombs happen we need them to get to xwe dont care about the deaths and the violence is endless just be prepared to watch people you dont care about and know nothing about die constantlythe show skips from one scene to the next like a baboon with add and that is the major difference between a good show like twin peaks and a waste of time like fallout we arent forced to deal with any unwanted or uneasy emotions for any significant period of time in fallout just think about that for a minute because part of that is the exact reason why people watch tv its called catharsis the concept has been around for millenniaits not the first or best show to do anything it attempts the humor falls flat the ghoul is cliché the dialogue is not memorable its a blood bath this show will make you stupid"
i was very suspicious in nowaday fallout cause nowadays are not what fallout was  fallout is about steampunk th of past century and this is a lot changes since then even if it is alternative historyso  before halloween bombs dropped out and world had gone almostlike the fourth fallout yeahthen we introduced to shelter  in  year meet lucy the one of survivors whos gonna do outer world better somedayand then this day came closer story of shelter  vault so as  and  is good but not very unique the third vault had been under same circumctances if you askedeverything looks like fallout here creators really gave a shot for it yet to someone who know no crnothing about  fallout can be confused i guess causs it two hundred years of plot nine years after the games but for someone who knows everything it will be still a lot of surpsisesi love it
goggins is one of my favorite actors here perfectly cast again he displays just enough combination of dash dread humor sympathy and quirkiness he is so unique purnell also perfectly cast showing the naïveness vulnerability and strength wonderful cast all aroundthe story is a drama in a dark and light comedy in a mystery in a scifi for  years after the apocalypse people live underground in tunnel built by a commercial selfinterested company and they are ready to get back above ground but somethings wrong the leader is kidnapped and its tough to tell who is actually the good guy and the bad guy which leads to the complexity and the mystery of the characters and the plottheres humans ironman type of soldiers ghouls terrible raw stateofnature humans above ground a brewing terrible state of sophisticated humans below the ground a beautiful dog and creatures revenge betrayal and moreas for me i like all genres of movies but it seems that this production is balanced enough to attract a very wide audience even those who might not gravitate toward scifi if you made me choose between this series and the marvel movies this is a far better and more engaging story than the best of the marvel the reason is that the story and the themes are so well balancedthis is a very wellmade production great casting direction sets and just a great story welltold each episode leaves you wanting more
i have never watched the video game but have loved the series it really needs a season two just because season one was so epic walton goggins plays the most excellent role without ever seeing his face but you cant mistake the voice ella is a great actress too she plays lucy in a most excellent role was always rooting for her its the first time i have seen her in a starring role and she does a bang up job for a heroine you are always rooting for i vote yes for a season two and maybe even more it really wants you to binge watch it and so i did if you havent already watched season one than i highly recommend you do
where to start grippinggrounded and well written  i have only played fallout  so my knowledge is limited but this is what adaptation should be  fan service and writing a original and compelling story  the main cast shine thanks too the script and fx to thier ability to pull you in to there senarios only one and small setback for me was the over use of the landscaped i swear we walked past the same place  times during this season that aside every character onscreen shines giving just enough story arc to not make any episode feel like a filler  i really enjoyed this and look forward to the next series well done prime you did have me worried but i loved this series
a pitch perfect rendition of a much loved game series if youre into the games it has some brilliant references and nostalgia fuel if youre not into the games it still has a compelling narrative weaving together multiple protagonists each with their own past and present flashbacks provide context and some excellent aha moments i was genuinely hookedthe casting is brilliant each lead is able to capture the dual personalities and conflicts within each character although i recognised the likes of walton goggins and kyle maclachlan i was still able to fully believe in their characters and the actors i had hitherto not recognised deserve to be more well knownthe costume and sets are incredibly well crafted and faithful to the source material there is a sort of beautiful decay to the fallout games and this series captures that and the score music is such a key part of the games and the series is practically a tutorial on how to pair scenes with preexisting musicthe best tv show based on a video game ever its bucking a trend
for anyone whos finished all the fallout games this show is a real treat it contains numerous nods to the entire fallout universe with a special emphasis on references from fallout new vegas and fallout  the introductions to the major factions and the exploration of the vaults backstory are particularly well done blending elements from across the game series into a cohesive and compelling narrativethe shows creators have managed to capture the essence of fallout creating a world that feels familiar yet fresh im looking forward to more seasons and episodes as the shows momentum builds this could easily become a hit drawing in new fans and rekindling interest among existing ones im thrilled to see where it goes nextgreat job bethesda
"the show is compelling and intelligent the themes touched on are timely and intelegent however it is highly self indulgent with its brutalitypros
characters the characters are all generally compelling and well realizedplot the plot grows and twists throughout the show in a digestible and compelling way it starts simple and grows wellmessage the show has a good message regarding corruption and power especially in regards to monopoliescons
disgusting the show seems to revel in just how horrible it can be it is so consistent that it starts being predictable with its awfulness the show will show you something nice and cute then the next moment kill it for dramatic effect just to be awfulpacing inconsistent pacing made me engage then disengage with the showthe show is good but i didnt enjoy watching it which is a very strange feeling"
fallout is really good its got its moments that will make you laugh and its got a comedic tone that instead of making everything feel cartoony makes everything feel so fun and just a treat while fallout may seem like just a fun comedy it is so much more fallout takes the original games to a next step and makes everything funnier more gory and a very good written story the various different plot twists hit the landing perfectly and work extremely well to give you the feeling of surprise with every episode fallout is the very rare occasion that a game gets the adaptation it deserves
i never played the game before but the first few episodes are a bit corny i guess thats the point to make it seem like everything was all peaches and cream in the vault while real life was happening on the surface lucy is annoying and is green to everything lol which is expected since she has had a shelter life her life kind of reminds me of religion and lucy is the preachers daughter im a big fan of the ghoul for surviving this long and hes a bad ass gun slinger now the iron brotherhood with the foolishness of having a squire running and carrying weapons for a heavily armored knight is just asinine this part just rubs me the wrong way actually but thats my takeaway from the first  episodes
 only because it looks mostly good poor casting bad plot and worse thing is the script its like the writers and director overheard a conversation from some people who also overheard a conversation about the fallout games there are so many inaccuracies not written or directed by true fans ghouls dont look like ghouls they are too pretty all the behaviors and dialogue of the characters are ridiculous everything that was obvious attempts at humor was not funny everything involving the brotherhood of steel is the most disappointing i hope that some serious changes are made on the writers director staff and cast as soon as possible
"im so glad to be able to say it but the series with all its ups and downs is  pure fallout i really like the cast  awesome folksthe opening scene was true cinematic fallout opening i hope this series only advance fallout as an ip there is so much stories to tell so much creative freedom to usethis is how a movieseries based on a game should be made with utmost respect to what made those games fun and engaging  the story characters humor and whatnotim already looking forward to season shout out to
ella purnell for being a real vault dwelleraaron moten for being paladin dansewalton goggins for being the most awesome game i have met in the fallout universe awesome actorand freakin annabel ohagan "
amazing to see so many details that youre familiar from its very rich and the first episode let you with the desire to see more and more and you can it was really nice the introduction of our main characters without being silly it was just nice to take a look how do they become and what is expected from them the landscape is really amazing and the vault perfect such a really good care to details the gadgets are there the s atmosphere is there and mr handy is like what we are used toso what can i saudade definitely the fallout experience is there and pretty sure you gonna like it
"sometime a review boils down to a single word hilarious
gruesome
emotional
poignant
authenticsometimes a plot synopsis boils down to a single chorus we three were all alone
living in a memory
my echo my shadow and mebut war 
war never changes
as a scifi fan this show brings an entirely new and interesting world into a vivid imagining competing factions with wellthought out motives and characters in a bleak and oddly beautiful setting coupled with a healthy dose of satire and you get a truly special showas an avid player of the games this adaptation ticks all of my boxes and more plus the ending really gets me excited for season if you like gritty scifi  watch it
if you like somehow campy but not campy scifi  watch it
if you like the games  watch it
if you like well written characters and can handle gore  watch it
seriously just watch itokey dokey"
i had no idea this was out untill very recently loved everything about it the characters are awesome and a good pace to the show there were some things i definitely didnt expect i also liked that they added some comedy that was actually funny and tasteful a lot of actors that ive liked in the past one of my favorite shows now and also a very good game seems to be just like the games i played i look forward to seeing the second season and hopefully i dont have to wait so long give it a try i pretty much was all the espisodes in a few days and will probably rewatch it and play the games again
so good i loved all the little details i was excited and i didnt assume anything because of this i was able to enjoy the show so fantastic the humor the story the curiosity it creates is phenomenal so many characters and stories to be told within this show im someone who gets stuck on one video game for years fallout  is one of those games when i say i know every detail i mean it this show absolutely follows through with those details i enjoyed the intensity the show also brought as well the introduction of the raiders was fantastic once i realized i was like no way how awesome
havent finished it but it is everything a fallout fan could ever ask for you get a glimpse in the the world of fallout as if you were playing the videogame tho i encourage for viewers to play the videogames i have only played fallout  and its incredible as a tv series promises a visually captivating postapocalyptic world morally complex characters and thoughtprovoking narratives with its rich lore and successful video game adaptations as precedent the potential for a compelling television adaptation is undeniable a faithful portrayal of the games storyline and exploration of its ethical dilemmas could make it the best adaptation of the franchise yet
i really enjoyed this series ive never played the games but i felt this was really good in establishing the world of fallout and they made everything easy to understand the acting across the board is really well done and the actors were all really well castmy primary complaint about the series is two things the first being there isnt a whole lot of character development our main characters lucy maximus and the ghoul largely end the season on the dame footing where they began the second being the insular characters are honestly more interesting than the main characters the doctor is an interesting character whom we just abruptly lose the radio dj obsessed with string instruments is one and done the tonic salesmandoctor scientist guy pops up and just as quickly disappears these characters are just here to show how strange this world is but honestly theyre so good that i found myself wanting more on them and less of the main characters
the whole season flies by in one breath and i want morethe authors do not hesitate to come up with new character plots and rules of the already existing game world this is only good for the work indespite the fact that not everyone likes the part setting especially fans of the old parts but it seems to me that this is the best option when you want to hook as large a percentage of viewers as possiblethe plot is interesting most of all i liked the plot twists about the father of one of the main characters and about that vault boythe actors are also pleasing to the eye its nice to see both established stars and newcomersthe effects of dismemberment and blood in general are very similar to the tv series the boys no wonder because one service deals with projects this is only a plus if its violence then its adultthe music is straight from the fourto summarize the series can be recommended to all fans of  parts but the rest of the wacky humor although it was full of isometric parts can scare awayit is very sad that the season came out so short and we will have to wait more than a year for new episodes i would like to see the adventures of the heroes in the already famous cities as soon as possible
initially i was preparing for complete failure today this is the default state but in anticipation of bad things surprisingly nothing bad happened quite a normal plot even classic regarding the main plot action there is no absurd break in the narrative no strong pull on topics that we would not like to see walton goggins works at  and pleases the eyesa pleasant abundance of fan service music costumes merch and more things like this sometimes its just looks too clean for this world and the feeling that they were filming with what they could dig up on ali or ebay for  bottle capsthe biggest disadvantage is that there is no atmosphere of a postapocalyptic world and a series of games there is almost no flair of the culture of america in the s at least there isnt that hopelessness and decay of f just regular modern people speaking about regular problemsthe actors talk looks and act like ordinary modern people drinking cappuccino in the center of new york  minutes ago except experienced ones like gogginsin our modern world you will probably find places that look worse and people who have more problems than in this worldsometimes against the backdrop of clean suits and regular acting you will think that youtubers have made highquality fan fictionthe series is perfect for those who are not a big fan of realistic postapocalyptic films games and books but loves the comedy of light absurdity who wants to look at the surroundings and a fresh perspective on this topic
the cgi is decent same for the fight scenes however the plot is quite weak the pacing was very slow after a while i had to start skipping some scenesi was really excited when this show was announced given the success of halo series i was expecting something similar this really fell shorti want to believe all the positive reviews are from people who have played the games and are already aware of the backstory for people like me who havent played the game yet the show doesnt do anything to explain the characters or to make you care about anythingjust a dull drawn out movie with lousy characters except the ghoul guy he really tried to bring life to the movie
i have played fallout  to fallout  and i loved playing the game series if you like the tv series you need to add the games to your library and you will love the game the tv show captured the essence of the game for non game players to enjoy the story line the t armored suit i thought was over the top ine detail and looked real a goul bounty hunter is a great part of the story and never seen that comming i thought the raiders looked to normal and not someone that had high levels of radition looking forward to nd season and i hope they add more episodes and answer some questions but alaska needs to be addressed
"no spoilers no nonsense just a few factsthis time amazon nailed it with a nail guni did not have high hopes for this one based on the current streak that all companies have with productions bad cgi bad stories agendas no true character development etc but this time i literally took a fat boy to the face 
those who got it got it
this is how you bring a female lead character into view and get audiences to love itshe aint super powered she aint badassshe becomes one as her story evolves
the choice of walton goggins was masterfully spot on although i know people initially had doubts but the man is amazing bravoto top it off there is huge fan service with all sorts of goodies from the game franchiseand they keep the lore that was a firstit seriously gets you hooked for season  because the three main characters and all the supporting ones have stories you get to see development and backgroundall in all this is a great show if you are used to good shows and a masterpiece amidst a sea of mostly mediocritythat is how its done"
this show is fun and entertaining to watch the directors know how to shoot a scene and make it impactful the characters are interesting the screenplay is good and the world is interesting as well i would recommend to watch this series also as a fan of the games the adaptation is faithful to the source material it is good to see the creators of the show care about the source material the show doesnt follow the story of any of the previous games rather it is a continuation and takes place some time after the events of fallout  i am happy with the job they have done and would like to see more seasons in the future
having played and delved into the world of fallout i was blown away by the sheer quality and attention to detail present in this tv series it feels as though the creators have seamlessly translated elements directly from the game into the visual medium capturing the essence of the fallout universe with remarkable accuracycontrary to the criticism i found the narrative to be perfectly in line with the tone and logic of the games every seemingly absurd coincidence pays homage to the nonsensical yet captivating nature of the fallout universe serving as a delightful nod to fansone of the series greatest strengths lies in its characters who expertly embody the contrast between vaultdwellers and those living beyond the confines of the vaults their depth and complexity add layers to the storytelling enriching the viewers experience and drawing them further into the world of falloutas i watched each episode i found myself transported back to my childhood reminiscing about the countless hours spent exploring the wasteland and forging unforgettable memories in the games the series masterfully captures the spirit of the fallout franchise evoking a sense of nostalgia and wonder that is truly magicali particularly admire how the creators portray the randomness and mystique inherent in the fallout games effectively building suspense and intrigue throughout the series every unexpected twist and turn adds to the immersive experience keeping viewers on the edge of their seats until the very endwhat i also loved was the flashbacks to prewar where the viewer learn more about the ramp up to atomic warin summary fallout is a triumph in every sense of the word with no discernible flaws to speak of it is a testament to the talent and dedication of its creators who have succeeded in bringing the beloved game series to life in a way that is both faithful and exhilarating fans of fallout old and new alike owe it to themselves to experience this remarkable series
i havent played the game the series is based on so its fealty to game lore i cant say however as a big fan of walton goggins this was another fun time purnell was strikingly beautiful throughout and each of the cast members were either dashing and lovely or delightfully crude the production design was first class ironic and easy on the eyes even the tragic dystopian wastelands the gore is pretty intense yet at the same time often hilariously executed no pun intendedthe music supervisor should get a medal as period music throughout is truly some of the best of the era often placed with ironic counterpoint to the action and yet at the same time at some level ghostly in its reminder that in this worldbuilding culture were suddenly frozen as billions were extinguishedin the fallout fun series
straight of the bat youre thrown into the world of fallout and that intro is really one of the best intros ive seen any piece of media its just a pity those initial scenes were so limited sort of like the first sip from a cool nukacolai wish i cared more about the characters and plot but they really just feel like d cardboard cutouts serving the purpose of tour guides to show us the world of fallout they do a really good job at this but as a result i they do little to make you care about themtheres also like zero original soundtracks for the show relying on preexisting soundtracks which were heavily used in the source material once again reinforcing the idea that the show is relying heavily on the fan service elementit has great action sequences and world building but beyond that it leaves much to be desired regarding the world of fallout
let me say right off the bat that im not a fan of the video game series and only partially know about it watching this series i was learning about the universe from scratch and i liked something but mostly noti want to note the good visuals a lot of different visual details related to the universe music and atmosphere in the spirit of the game good acting and thats iti found the first episode terrible in so many ways namely the dialogs are strange it looks dragged out its done well enough at the same time but also with amateurish moments the performances are clumsy the soundtrack in some places didnt like there are illogical moments of the script and most importantly  the world doesnt seem natural i cant believe in this world given the fantasy of whats going on until the very end of season  although it became more interesting to watch as the plot progressed sure the script is pretty okay at some points but for the most part it doesnt shine with reason the graphics towards the end of season  are of lesser quality than in the beginning to me as a person completely unfamiliar with the universe hyperbolizing not explained from the first series about this world and how everything is arranged in detail having watched  season to the end im sure that i dont understand all the things in the universethe series is extremely overrated by video game fans in my opinion i dont see why the series has an  except for the visuals matching the universe characters music and atmosphere the authors tried to recreate the universe and judging by the fans they succeeded but the script of the series itself brings it down to the level of mediocre series destroying the interest in such a story
my grade was  because i judged the series with a technical eye and i came to the conclusion that technically the series script is standardized and predictable at several moments i was able to deduce what was going to happen other than that the series has a good pace at times at others not so much like the last episode of the first season where at times the scenes were very slow the positive points are the scenarios battles references to the game the humor and the atmosphere the script between the future and the past was ok the final revelation that the protagonists father is behind everything was really cool the script greatly favors the protagonists so it is clear that it is a predictable and ok script the creatures are a good positive point but we didnt have many on the scene the ending leaves a hint for a possible season well there are several points to consider but i will just leave these comments from my perspective
a nolan was responsible for this disjointed messthe characters are unbelievable unlikable and uninteresting almost entirely due to the storytelling jumping around so much and leaving out enormous chunks of their lives why with eight hours or so of time afe so many characters so underdeveloped why is so much of the socalled wasteland in relatively good upkeep after so many years exposed to the elements and no one to maintain any of itmany sequences are painfully long and do nothing to enhance the story many sequences are introduced and over so quickly one wonders why they even botheredits painful to watch
right well this series is definitely one that i had been waiting for and once it was released i sat down and binged the entire first seasoni have been a huge fan of the fallout games and have been playing them ever since the very first game was released so yeah there definitely was something riding on this series and it was a franchise that so very much deserved either a movie or series adaptation so thumbs up to amazon prime for bringing this to the audiencethe storyline throughout the first eight episodes that was season  was a nicely written one it definitely felt like a storyline and narrative that you would find and expect in the fallout universe so the writers nailed it on the head because this was entertaining and enjoyable from start to endthey had a great cast ensemble in the series with some good leading performers and also good support performers there were a fair amount of familiar faces on the cast list and walton goggins was so nicely cast for the role of cooper howard needless to say that it was nice to see aaron moten portray maximus as that character is a core essential character in the lore of the fallout universethe character gallery in fallout was good lots of interesting and memorable charactersfallout definitely had that particular post apocalyptic feel and touch to it that we love from the games and the attention to detail throughout the eight episodes was phenomenal i will say that the episodes are wellworth sitting down to watch two times once for the story then again for observing all the minute details and things from the games that made it into the serieshowever the fallout series was not all just great things because it definitely also had its flaw the series was missing iconic creatures such as super mutants deathclaws radscorpions molerats centaurs etc and i was also disappointed in not seeing the use of laser and plasma weapons in use throughout the series sure you see laser weapons in the relic store but would be nice to have seen them in use these creatures and weapons are a big part of the fallout universethe setting and scenes throughout the series are good well for the most parts there were scenes that were not having that particular fallout nuclear post apocalyptic feel to it here i am thinking of all the scenes where the wasteland had green plants growingthe wardrobe and props in the series were good i really liked the costumes and props that you see throughout the series and who cant help but cheer when you see the power armor for the first timeregardless amazon prime did a great job in bringing the game franchise to the screen and i certainly was wholeheartedly entertained throughout the course of all eight episodes and if you enjoy the games then you definitely have to sit down and watch thismy rating of the first season of fallout lands on an eight out of ten stars
absolutely wicked took a few episodes to properly catch my interest but once it kicks in and the plot starts moving i couldnt stop watchingtop performances from everybody but gotta shout out walton goggins because he smashed it the most by miles great direction cinematography special effects music etcobviously with a show like this you need to use cgi to create certain visuals however for the most part the cgi is actually great and they didnt just use cgi to create everything they needed you can tell they took the time to use as much practical effects as they needed to create the right aestheticnever played the game myself but have a fair few mates ive seen playing it and ive watched plenty of clips online and from what i can see here they have nailed the look and feel of the world tooi also very much appreciated that they didnt ease up on the horrorgore elements and the attention to detail with a lot of things was fantasticvery excited for season  and where they go with it
i wasnt even that excited for the release of fallout as im not a gamer but i had played fallout  years ago briefly so i knew the look and feel that would be aimed at for the tv series have to be honest it totally blew me away right from the very opening scene the sets the costumes the props the makeup  all perfect the story was gripping enough for me to have watched all of it in two daysthe sets are incredible the effort that went into the small details is immense at times my eyes were wandering off into the backgrounds lost in the post apocalyptic shanties and charactersill definitely be giving it a second view soon it was totally immersive
we are enjoying it watching it has made us want to jump back into falloutwhich we will probably do after we are done watching we husband and i think they did a really good job with the props and environments it is neat to see the game come to life we recommend even if you watch it and find you did not like some of it it is still a good the actors are decentsome are really good allinall they picked a good cast of people for the roles they are in we had been following the progress for a long time it was worth the wait i will wrap this up by saying we dont think you will be disappointed
i would really like to rate higher than an  but my biggest complaint is that they didnt do enough to bring non gamers up to speed as a fan of the game franchise i really liked the show my wife whos never played was totally lostthe best solution they could still do is add in a short video maybe in the animated pip boy style that educates the viewer on the wasteland approach it with the concept of someone that knew nothing about the seriesfor the show itself i really liked it the cgi looks pretty good the acting has been excellent so far about halfway through the writing has been just as good as the games i would honestly give this a  if they could find a way to bring in viewers that know nothing about the franchise without getting them completely confused as to whats going on
this takes me out of it sometimes maybe some scenes work with itbut music is important and the really bad choices stand out otherwise im enjoying it mostly michael rappaport is great in everything  have had a bigger role with fewer f words he talks like that off camera naturally and it makes him less funny i do think some familiarity with the game is helpful to enjoy it like most video game adaptations overall fans of game movie adaptations who play the game are more into the movies in part just out of excitement that a game they love is actually a moviegamers have stronger attachments to games than movies in general which makes sense  avg game these days takes  hours to play made like a movie with talented real actors  directors usually over several months unless you have a lot of free time vs a hour movie i couldnt really get into the game even had a copy  traded it in without getting very far i prefer video game adaptations to all the reboots  sequels which seems to be the only ideas leffa tv series format is much more forgiving like game of thrones had only  episodes  was like the last season itd have been panned and cancelled tv shows can redeem themselves over time chatgptdoesnt write better scripts as evidenced by hbos monarch garbage good writing is  and like a few lessrambly reviewers said it was lazy and nonsensical in several scenes  the sun worshipping orgy the sexchildbirth scene to name  make the ghost of tsushima movie already
lets start with the fact that those who were expecting a dark melancholic drama with complex philosophical explorations in the spirit of the book of eli  or the opposite full of killer action in the form of doomsday  will be disappointed fans of art house and sixstring samurai  are also unlikely will like the adaptation amazons fallout although it has a little bit of everything in it ultimately remains a predominantly evil satire with elements of fan service taking the ideological and conceptual basis of the controversial fourth part of the game seriesthe shelters are safe but the wasteland is lifeless only at first glance monsters come not only in the form of cockroaches water creatures but also people consumerism of the fifties played a cruel joke on its ideological inspirers the authors quickly go over the top paying a lot of attention to small details references and key elements some of which however will only be understandable to hardcore fans of the genre a scene later they joke about the fact that the brotherhood of steel uses old technologies to collect technologies while simultaneously sarcastically noting that there is no practical use for a toaster found in a scorched desert they immediately switch to the next segment without really plunging into the context this approach is reflected in its own way on the main charactersa shelter resident raised on high ideals is forced by circumstances to go to the surface and face harsh realitya boy who miraculously survived tormented by moral dilemmas builds his career in the brotherhood of steelghoul cowboy an ambiguous character with a partially vague past whose image and behavior adjusted for local realities are almost completely copied from the man in black from westworld at first all three will be united by the search for a certain object that can change the fate of the entire surrounding surviving world along the way the main story arc as usual in an rpg with action elements is diluted with several side stories of varying degrees of interestduring flashbacks when one of the characters indulges in rhetorical reasoning a third kind character interrupts him with an apt thought  they are all just a product for later consumption so its time to forget about art and any meaningful depth in a world ruled by corporations and a joyful consumer culture what serves as a small plot digression is equally applicable as a verdict on the first season the film adaptation is not bad in its own way but at the same time its required to understand its specifics and what lies at its core so as not to expect from it what it is not
the series is quite good it perfectly conveys the atmosphere for those who played the game should like it i love the postapocalypse theme there are not many films on this topic what disappointed me was the casting for the role of maximus where did they even find this actor hes pretty uninteresting and uncharismatic and hes mad throughout the series the rest of the actors are well chosen the soundtrack is cool its a pity that there are not many episodes i would like more hopefully there will be many seasons and not many years to wait nuclear cocacola to all after the series you will want to play the game again
im the first to admit the humour here is peculiar but it keeps me smiling like a loon its entirely fresh out of cruel jokes and it works just fine for me jonathan nolan realised quite a bit and enrolled a favourite actor of david lynch the missing father to jumpstart the action lets get weirdo in here hardcore republicans not welcome to say booh  seeing what the world would be with you in charge is not your forte a ghoul turned smarter in death than alive reminds us how duped you were because he was you you wont like itive quite enjoyed the ride with its touches of neoabsurd at times oh spoilers  their robots arent terminatorswe all know the origins of the dystopia in this paralel world that shifted in the early s and the cuban crisis parano in the usa for us a bit later with the wrong choices for them the fallout is not that brutal and the rich or obsessed by commies hidden in their vaults have become the opposite of their ancestors mostly in some vaults anyway theyre all good i mean stupid good  downright socialist values in fact in the heroins shelter which means something is awefully wrong  for people obsessed with details why would future people grow corn in the desert  now you get it a blessed child from eden sorry her vault steps out and bravely and stupidly discovers the world and the lies shes been fed and struggles to adapt despite wellmeaning people from the surface its like the cave allegory all over again her reality is perceived shadows of the outside her brother hardly the adventurer is quite the sleuth on the inside and discovers some disturbing truths tooits rather entertaining if you get the humour or point of the tale if not forget it after the first episode it may just be some commie hollywood junk to lure you out of the right path and its a bomb to quote a piece of after disaster humour its not nearly as radically critical or provocative as the boys for instance its a very polite asswhupping of old clichés all the same
lets get one thing straight from the off this is a none gamer review sorry to draw comparisons from other similar material but the last of us was a tour de force of tv storytellingin comparison fallout is simply hinterland inferior trashactors are great production is very good script is appalling editing appears to fuelled by magic mushrooms the music department got fried the first day and was replaced by the cast of the jetsonsi was really looking forward to this but just  episodes in its making me wonder my life choices of being a lifelong scifi fan my god its so poor it hurts
we need more ella purnell she stole the show great series the time period its set in the fall out universe fits well the vibe is fun and the vfx is great looking forward to another season already prequel series before the events might be interesting but for now we got  full episodes and hoping for more seasons in the future the actionadventure is really good for a video game inspired series one of the best we have seen in a long time okie dokie overall i give this series a solid  ella is great as lucy and the rest of the cast fits well with their characters solid show on prime video
i believe that the most important thing this series does in its first season is building the universe the action is set it was one of the few game adaptations to the big screen or tv show that made me want to play the games again especially fallout  and fallout  which the shows visuals are based on the characterization work for the main characters is very thorough and this is point awarded to nolans team and they also managed to capture and adapt very well this retrofutiristic postapocalyptic universe that we see in the games not much of characters development is present in the first season but it is the first season i really hope that the show can be confirmed for a second season and then we will see more of character development across the board perhaps even more easter eggs from the games in this first season i managed to spot a few
it takes time to develop the story but the last episode of this first season makes it absolutely worth the wait the effects and graphics are very neatly done too i began to wonder if the series was based on a video game because it totally could post apocalyptic philosophical thriller i love how well theyve take the time and the whole of the first season to build up the storyline and the characters i hope the season  comes quickly and doesnt disappoint i strongly recommend the show for everyone in need of something refreshing to watch its at times gory but its not horror for anyone wanting to know this bit cant wait for the next season
first off ignore all the negative reviews about this show its mostly fanboys who cant get every single detail of the game into the show from the acting writing and production value this show is amazing the tone is just right the score is great and they tie a lot of the games elements into the show watch at least the first  minutes for yourself and see if its your vibe this is my first review and had to write something after seeing all the incel trolls how can you go wrong with baby billy as the ghoul stayed up until  am watching the first four episodes and ready to get off work and watch the restcheers
fallout  prime videoobviously i knew the videogames but i was never interested in watching gameplays until now of course now i want to go deeper into this universe to find out certain thingsthere are too many mysteries in the plot and a bizarre policy if we talk about the shelters they are very strange its like seeing a beehive manipulated for certain missions under lock and key and you must investigate why this or that is done chapter  has thrown me off with certain themesan extremely important detail that has made me fall in love is that they do not only focus on the main character there are more characters telling their stories individually showing how their lives were before the changesnot to mention that there are some very awkward strange and even funny moments in some occasions there is a mix of everythingthe s music spectacularthe mixed s retrofuturistic nuclear apocalyptic vibe is incredible being an alternate history of earth after world war ii the fact that its very psychological is very engaging that they show things from  years later in what the earth would be like in that apocalyptic future i love itpolitics in this universe is marked by the collapse of traditional government structures and the emergence of new factions each with their own agenda and worldview authoritarianism and totalitarianism anarchy communism and extreme nationalism in addition to the more common democracy republic and much communist the fallout universe features a variety of dystopian and extreme politics reflecting the catastrophic consequences of war and nuclear destruction on human societyits an addictive season to learn more and i would have loved to have more chapters to delve into the pastits a marvel of a plot the locations are visually epici need the second season immediately
they keep the style of the games music but unfortunately they keep bethesda tradition of poor and uninspiring dialoguestv series is clearly made for game fans theres no much intro into world building what is the background of each fractionsome moments looks unrealistic and unlogical even for fallout retrofuturistic world building as the other user pointed out how protection system were so ignorant to the radiationi have played almost every game from this franchise and even they were not so idiotic in some moments also i was really happy to see that they gave a role to ron perlman who is a voiceover veteran in this franchise
im convinced nobody who left a onestar review watched past the first episodethere are some issues with it for sure but overall i had a blast i thought it was true to the spirit of the games yes ive played them and also was compelling by itselfthere were so many little details to notice and the characters were actually interesting each flawed in their own ways and each of them ending up different than they startedsometimes the comedy felt forced some of the lore was off but almost every time something didnt make sense it was explained later you just gotta be patient with a story like this they cant explain everything right away without it feeling like an info dumpdid a really great job of showcasing the universe while also maintaining an interesting and individual presence in that universe
saying the f word every  words does not make your show edgy and cool swearing is not replacement for dialogue anywaysive been a hardcore fan of the games for many many years and played everything from three to  and fallout shelter lol i really really wanted to like that show but considering it was on prime and the serious failure of other video game to tv adaptions i didnt have much hope and i really wasnt surprised when it was not that great and then happily surprised when it blossomed after episode  the show is excessively violent in the first episodesto the point where its not enjoyable to watch its a lot different playing a fake cartoonish looking video game and knowing that everything that youre doing in it is not real and video game violence doesnt have the same visual and emotional impact as seeing a real life persons head exploding that may be the world that they live in but theres no reason to watch it as entertainment its just savage not to mention its an extremely lame excuse for not writing good stories and dialogue and just being like oh well just have them explode or be gutted thatll be fun right umm no dont get me wrong the propsstages cgi and the power armor are great and accurate why is the brotherhood only men why is the brotherhood only men its not in the game why is there no trace of vault girl i like the lead woman as shes so innocent and derpy that its very comical and i like the ghoul hes complicated he used to be good but hes turned so bitterevil after living so long  being mangledlosing his family and knowing the truth theres also the dark humor which i appreciate because that is a large part of fallout although it could be more dark funny and less goofy but at least its there maximussiiighhhh its funny but hes also so annoying the giant sack they haul around really made me laugh over encumbered they also made a mistake with the animals because they arent bald mutated but i do like the fact that they used real animals rather than animating them but they arent accurate if the second season is like episodes  then ill watch it
ill start off with saying that i have played the games and love them what this show does brilliantly is nail the feeling of the games with the music and the visuals which is executed very well for me the only other positive in the show is the character and acting of walton goggins who is absolutely brilliant as the ghoul  stand out performancewhere the show really lacks is how much they attempted to pack into  episodes i found myself watching at points and getting quite bored as huge plot lines would be skipped over in a few minutes with no real development i felt as though apart from goggins character the plot was really lackingthe worst part of the show though was aaron moten as maximus i dont think ive watched a show with a more dislikable character in a long time not only that i found his acting performance rather lacklustre and unconvincing i wanted to skip scenes that had him in by the end the entire plot line with the brotherhood felt forcedim not really sure why this show has such a high rating i wanted to love it and im by no means a purist in regards to the games but i found that the writing and acting really let it down
amazons adaptation of the fallout video game series delivered at every moment it wholly embraces the maturity of the games its story and embodies the spirit of the source rather than trying to make it into something entirely different a whole lot of fun for both gamers and nongamers who appreciate good storytellinghigh praise to the writers the actors the actresses the directors the special effects teams etc they all brought their agame into making this series like none other and bringing the fallout world onto the silver screen computer screen or where ever it can be watched from this is a great tribute and shows high respects to the creator of the fallout titles tim cain
i agree with most other  star reviewers the wasteland is weak but note that even in the game the wasteland was weak enough at certain spots to walk normally without any radiation there are a few scenes that didnt follow any game logic but i believe that was needed for the tv adaptation other than that this is an absolute masterpiece ive like the witcher series as much as this series in terms of tv adaptation cant wait to see the next seasonnote if you are a hardcore fan of the game series and dont like the tv adaptation the issue is not with the tv adaptation but how you perceived it maybe ease up and change your perspective a little
this is a near perfect adaptation of a video game i thought the last of us was fantastic but the environment and story of that title was much simpler to addressthat show didnt have the complex world and distinct lore that that fallout games have it feels more of a triumph bringing a title like fallout to the screen because of all the moving parts the unique s aesthetic introducing different clans and the humourthis show nails it its absolutely stunning for fans of the series or for those looking to be introduced to it i guess this could be the start of a golden age for video game to tv adaptation well done prime for backing it and to bethesda who have been looking for a much needed win
i was leery about how this would go but after watching it i have to say they nailed it on literally every front its amazing and must see for fallout fans and even those who have never followed the games just they might miss some of the eastereggs and references i love the casting choices as well again was a little skeptical going in but it worked incredibly wellgetting to see the vault and the environment around the fallout world in live action geez i dont think i could ask for more big thumbs up to amazon prime for doing justice to this series and not letting the themes of our day pollute it to much to get messaging across that none of us really want to see we want to be entertained and this is entertaining
this seems like bits and pieces of others scify films the squeaky clean girl goes roaming in the the post apocalyptic world looking for her abducted dad her naivete is unbelievable yet the exposure to the outside causes her to grow goggins plays a wild west cowboy ghoul bounty hunter but is he dead or what this actor really brings star quality in all he does sort of like jack nickonson despite the usual gory blood baths with poor character development the world of a nuclear disaster makes for iinteresting material lucy the protagonist blithely just happens to walk into a town and finds trouble she does not understand at every turn aome one rescues her a weird choice of s technology is featured metal armored suits  all kinds of mercenaries  and hidden orders battle to gain supremecy the soundtrack is horrible takes away from the films ambiance it gets better it grows on you hope for season 
when they anounced that they were going to do the fallout story with a female vault lead i was very concerned that the show would be chalked full of all the same boring and sexist nonsense that has been invading scifi comicbook and video game movies as of late after watching the first episode i am pleased to say that so far there are no girlbosses no misandry no gender whining and no dei plot armor the first minute of introduction to the main protagonist definitely gave off a cringey girlboss feminist vibe but that quickly subsided as we got to know a character that presented herself as genuinely strong and capable yet not flawless and whineyoverall i like the humor and i like that they were able to introduce a diverse cast and a female lead without falling into the typical hollywood garbage tropes that usually comes with modern efforts for inclusivity i look forward to watching the rest of the season
i understand this is set on a video computer game from the late s i watched the first episode and thought what a load of complete rubbish but fate intervened the next day it bucketed of rain so i thought lets endure the next  episodes as it turns out its a good yarn not as bloody as i was led to believe but those bits were obviously from the shoot me up game the interesting bit for me was to see what transgresses with the vaults how they came about  in that i think it could have been completed in two episodes there was a bit of fallow humour the parallels with the modern mic was very good a few messages that may have gone completely over the head of a less mature audience as in age i liked the retro s look at times and im assuming its an alternative universe but maybe im looking too deep the ending was too obvious for me and in fact i guessed the premise from episode  when the father kyle maclachlan gets kidnapped however it was better than i suspected it seems the fanboys of the game are divided on the film series if like me youve never played the game or ever intend playing the game itll be worth a watch
as a longtime fan of fallout i loved this season the themes and ideas the series explores with worked really well it manages to mix a serious story and somewhat dark tones with jokes and funny moments just like the games do salty fans gatekeeping the franchise will give it  stars i say ignore both them and me and go watch the series on your own so you wont get influenced casting was done really well for both main and secondary characters my favourites being thadeus and the dog good girl you will notice a lot of attention being put in making the series as you can tell by looking at the costumes weapons enviroments makeup a lot of attention to the pipboy such as sounds light geyger counter and interface and lets not forget about food and beverages from episode  to the last seconds of episode  i was left speechless continously and let me tell you that ending shot with the sunwell we sure know whats coming next thanks god i survived long enough to see this and lets hope i make it to the next season and game btw lots of violence and gore a lot of creatures come to life thanks to a really good cgi and altough i was left satisfied i would really like to see a few things next season a reference of some kind to the aliens more nukacola varietis a synth the misterious stranger and a behemoth as always youll be conflincted on who gains you simpaty because of every character and factions goals and motivations and even the villain will have good points this is all from my review ad victoriam
really nails the games the costume is spot on in that it also embraces being over the top in that falloutrockstar humor it is cool seeing the games like this and the guy who plays the ghoul he is just a perfect creep and crack up im really sorry if he is a great person in real life cause i believe every sleazy thing this guy doeswhy the meager rating the plain jane boring writing no chara yer development forever it seems they chose to make the characters just like atrociously stupid and its honestly hard to watch they just do the dumbest things to b le in distress constantly i dont know why that is necessary considering that they are living in a nuclear wasteland the story is delivered at a snails pace we are shoveled endless gore for gores sake i think that is a mistake we have had few years of relentlessly realistic gore in high budget works produced by netflix and all that apple exclusive stuff im tired of it its overused and how distracts and detracts from the story it once sold how extreme something was now its like tattoos more than half of people have them on their face and they look like a bunch of sheep following the herd its no longer rebellious and edgy all those girls grew up didnt leave the trailer had kids and took them to get these tattoos on their th bday lmao anyways back to the review because it seems i have not made the dear and all inclusive six hundred american english characters limit i must be mistaken rightthe show is entertaining especially if you like the games i couldnt finish them and this slow delivers on interesting story so slowly after it starts with a bang like i thought it was going to go right in and now im like a baby along with the girl because she is just so naive that none of these experiences are changing her and nobody can talk like a superhero movie all is just fists to drive the bad writing and then some deus ex machina to further save bad writing everybody is very convenient in the path they wonder after the last cgi attack lol
ive been a massive fan of the games put hundreds and hundreds of hours into them so im familiar with the quirky world and sometimes dark characters and situations and the games are also violent but seriously people who find this level of absurd gore and ultraviolence entertaining are disturbed individuals the makers of this show just want it to be the boys but why cant it just be fallout youve already got an extremely popular highly beloved franchise with an incredibly rich world to play in this show could be incredible it takes some special people to turn such a sure thing into garbage
first of all i did not expect this show to be this gory and gruesome i mean with how brutal the world of this show is it makes sense for it to be this gory and pg just wouldnt be as realistic if it had more gory and bloody scenes i would think i was watching a body horror instead of postapocalyptic scifiand im not saying that as a negative exactly the opposite actually i just didnt expect it to go as far as it did and im glad because boy do those scenes look goodso as kind of a jonathan nolan fanboy because of person of interest and the first season of westworld i had no doubt this show would be good but it actually surpassed even my expectations as to how engaging and wellwritten this wasi honestly hate that tv shows nowadays only have  episodes per season and you have to wait  to  years till the next one comes out and you will have already lost all interest or dont remember anything by the time the next season is out but thankfully the writers here managed to not only tell a somewhat full story in these  episodes but the finale wasnt rushed like every other new show with under  episodesnearly every episode is an hour so youll get enough time to get introduced to the characters the story and the world and they do a phenomenal job with the worldbuildingfrom the very first episode you immediately get thrown into this world and youll get so immersed in it that you dont want to even get up to go to the bathroom and yeah of course i just binged the whole show for  hours straightthe storytelling here is great the heros journey and what she goes through is really well done this isnt one of those situations where the protagonist has plot armor and nothing bad ever happens to her she actually goes through some sht here and the character development here is great lucy from episode  is nothing like episode  lucythe show is also a great adventure show too the journey of the protagonists throughout the show is great as they get thrown into these postapocalyptic and weird survival situations that they have to find a way to get out of and they are all engaging and you just cant wait to immediately watch the next episode when you finish onethe visuals are amazing here the production value here is topnotch and they build a really believable world that feels lived in with a great variety of charactersthis show might not be as deep and philosophical as season  of westworld but if they keep up the quality writing and dont do another westworld season  to  this might end up being even better than thatand sure the villains motivation here is a bit cartoonishly evil but i think it kinda makes sense in the context of this worldthe storytelling here is great flashbacks are kind of nolans forte when it comes to storytelling and fallout is no exception they give us more character backstory and worldbuilding through these little flashbacks and they have the intrigue of vault  that keeps you guessing till the last episode waiting for the revelation they know how to keep the audience engaged and not reveal everything in episode  so there wouldnt be any mystery or intrigue to keep the audience invested in the storyand like i said the protagonist here is great she goes through some pretty gruesome stuff in her journey through the wastelands and has moral conflicts about the situations she gets into thats how a great protagonist should be a relatable and likable hero that gets changed by her journey and evolvesand yeah the overall story isnt the most original one or one that you cant predict its clichés or anything but when its well done and well incorporated into the context of the story and the world who cares if there are some clichés here and there after all you cant have a story without clichésand i almost forgot to mention how funny the little bits of comedy they threw in here are its not cringey marvel level of jokes and comedy bits that ruin the tension or the serious scenes its actual funny moments that happen in the context of the story that are just welldone and wellplacedso overall this is one of the best most wellmade and most engaging recent shows ive watched or even all the shows in general and also not to mention that it is another great adaptation of a video game i might even like this more than the last of us show honestlyso heres hoping the next season doesnt take  years to make and also doesnt end up like the rest of westworld
fallout the television adaptation of the beloved video game franchise has hit amazon prime video and its a triumph fans can breathe a sigh of relief  this isnt your typical video game turned tv show showrunners graham wagner and geneva robertsondworet have crafted a postapocalyptic world that feels both familiar and freshthe story follows ella purnells compelling portrayal of vault dweller dweller yes thats her name who emerges from her luxurious underground shelter  years after a nuclear war thrust into the harsh realities of the wasteland she encounters a world teeming with the series signature charm  a quirky blend of s americana and brutal survivalthe series excels in worldbuilding the familiar iconography of the games  from the rusty pipboy interfaces to the menacing super mutants  is translated beautifully to the screen but its not just about nostalgia the show expands the fallout universe introducing new factions and locations that feel like natural extensions of the lorehigh marks go to the shows visual effects the irradiated wasteland is a character in itself rendered with a grimy realism that perfectly complements the shows darker moments yet the whimsical touches  a prewar robot butler navigating a ruined city a bustling trade caravan bartering with bottle caps  add a layer of humor that keeps the tone balancedfallout boasts a stellar cast walton goggins chews the scenery as a charismatic ghoul with a hidden agenda while aaron moten brings gravitas to a weary wastelander searching for redemption but its purnell who shines brightest her wideeyed innocence as she confronts the harsh realities of the wasteland is both endearing and heartbreakingthe show isnt without its changes from the games character builds and branching narratives are understandably absent but the core themes of hope resilience and the cost of civilization remain the writers have cleverly incorporated winks and nods to the games without alienating newcomers to the franchisefallout isnt just a faithful adaptation its a fantastic television series in its own right it boasts a captivating story a beautifully realized world and strong performances whether youre a seasoned vault dweller or a wasteland rookie fallout is a mustwatch on amazon prime video just dont forget to pack your radaway  things are about to get radioactive
i thought this series would blow so hard but all my fears went away after watching the first episode ill try to avoid spoilers the best i can but the way they tackle the  plots that follow one character all with their own motivations i say was done very well as a show its very good i have played a few fallout games but never finished any of them now i might this show doesnt just appeal to fans obviously the references for fan service is alive and well but people that dont know the games very well can still enjoy it if i had to squeak out one complaint is that the depiction of wasteland looks more like just a plain old desert and not a landscape that underwent a nuclear blast not a spoiler the name says it all its not that it looks bad its just in the games you see the damage that was caused by the blasts even centuries later in the show it just sand and sometimes trees it just felt underwhelming to me other than that its a great show i came in with very low expectations and was blown away definitely recommend
i think the people who are complaining about this series just want to complain the show was an excellent adaptation of the fallout series it took the subtle and not so subtle humor of the game and translated it perfectly to the small screen indeed i cant think of a single point in the game that i didnt see in the series there were times i questioned elements in the series and considered whether it would be part of the game if the game wanted a smaller purchasing audience and the answer was always the show got it right it translated not just the letter of the game but also the spirit of the gameive read the reviews about wokist elements in the series and i while i know what theyre talking about i just dont see it to the degree of deserving criticism first of all the game was never about a s current earth the game is really an alternate world were atomic energy is used in a variety of tools household appliances and vehicles so one really cant advance an idea that this doesnt replicate s world culture its not meant to be with that premise tossed it leaves the series to establish whatever characters it wants however i never saw one single character that wasnt in keeping with the game  not onceany accusation of the main character being a mary sue is a false one i believe if one makes that accusation than any game character is a mary sue anyone who plays the game knows you start with abilities and increase them as time goes by we can assume that lucy is approximately  years old when episode one begins this means that she has had some time to develop certain skills as indicated at the very beginning of episode onei believe the show does a good job of mixing the various fallout games  and new vegas and i enjoyed that about it the set design and costumes were absolutely on point whoever did the sets and costumes definitely deserves an emmy i think the actors did a tremendous job of conveying their characters from a game to a showthe mature parts of the show were also conveyed within the context of the game the game alludes to many of the things that happened in the show but never comes right out and shows it i think the show captured that spirit wellit is going to be hard to find a show to watch after this i am already wishing there was a second season out and i cant wait for it to appear i will be rewatching this st season again
i have been a huge video game fan for decades playing atari nintendo sega microsoft and playstation consoles i have enjoyed thousands of videos games for decades and i am a really huge fan of the fallout series of games from bethesda recently several video games adaptation have appeared on streaming twisted metal on peacock halo on paramount plus and of course the last of us on max which i found to be both boring and pointless and i really hated the second game in the series when it comes to fallout i was highly skeptical as were millions of fans of the game however to my surprise it is definitely the best live action video game to television adaption yet with a plot that actually makes since and superb acting after the fiasco that was rings of power that made me want to cancel my prime subscription they redeem themselves with the awesome reacher series and now fallout my favorite live action video game show to date jonathan nolan  brother of oscar winner christopher of westwood fame really enjoys playing the games and it shows in every detail including hundreds of easter eggs within the game series bravo prime you did a great job with fallout
these people who are saying the pacing is too slow probably sit on tiktok all day watching brainrot i am  and sat through every episode excited for the next this is a great adaptation and all these fallout superfans need to stop nitpicking on the tiny details like how ghoulification works who cares its a great show that stays mostly true to lore it has a compelling storyline and great visuals and to all of you who say oh but the show relies on cgi too much how about you go make a postapocalyptic nuclear wasteland using practical effects dont listen too the one star reviews they just dont know a good tv show if it slapped them in the face
woudlve given it a higher score but really cant stand the annoying music and slow motion why cant they just fight without the stupid music and slow motion  other than those its a pretty enjoyable series so far woudlve given it a higher score but really cant stand the annoying music and slow motion why cant they just fight without the stupid music and slow motion  other than those its a pretty enjoyable series so far woudlve given it a higher score but really cant stand the annoying music and slow motion why cant they just fight without the stupid music and slow motion  other than those its a pretty enjoyable series so far
this show rocks i cannot believe it turned out this good i love the games and felt like it would be tough to adapt because of the tone and outrageous aspects of the world but to quote the todd it just works the show nails everything from vibe to music to costume and set design it is clearly high budget and there are tons of deep cut game references for the fans all the characters are like able the writing is funny each plot line is interesting and they intertwine just the right amountone of the best video game adaptations ever if not the best made me immediately go back to the games watch this show
fallout is a very beloved series amongst gamers with its extensive worldbuilding and lore the variety of factions and people that populate its wastelands to its themes of corporatism and political ambition and its morality  ethics of human society its ripe for the picking stories to be told all and all fallout does well in not only respecting its source material but also serving as an entry point for newcomers without holding your hand putting you in the perspective of its main character starting with lucy the vault dweller given her isolated upbringing and what she has been told her whole life shes reckless naive and gullible she has to adapt and learn from the people she comes across and the choices she has to make and live with the other two main characters the ghoul who is my favorite just this complete badass bounty hunter and coldhearted man you get to see his past prewar and whats driving him maximus this brotherhood squire who goes rogue in ways makes questionable choices in brotherhood all three of their stories are tied to this scientist also this subplot mystery centered around vaulttec it feels balanced out and paced the journey you dont need to know everything about the enclave brotherhood or ncr prop also has to be given to the designers i felt that they would have just done the bare minimum the only wellmade wouldve been the power armor no they did put effort into capturing the setting and atmosphere of the games morbid dark and violent the vaults corps things like the pipboy display and how it functions the action lots of blood and the use perfect use of slomo call back to v a t s the choice of music how they had original music but also took from the game soundtrack and the way its used adds to the charm overall i enjoyed it and for another season if it stays this route
i feel like the show wouldve been x better if theyd removed the lucy storyline and just followed the ghoul her story added nothing and was just plain irritating it was filled with plot holes toothe show missed the entire vibe of fallout and changed lore because they wanted to fit things neatly into their story everything felt forced like they needed to cram as much in as possibleif you arent a fallout fan maybe youd like it but if you are a fan this just doesnt work it felt like a really bad fan fic im disappointed i was really hoping that there would be a whole series we could enjoy in between games i dont think i could make it through another episodethe show shouldve chosen a direction and a story and stuck with it instead of being all over the place just a mess
as someone that has played the games i loved the first season i think that it stayed very true to the games even the gore was just enough but not over the top one of my favorite lines is when they poke fun at how side quest always distract you from the main story line of the games and indeed that is what happens in the tv series as well also it downplays sex to a meaningless sidebar that the characters have which mimics the flirt options in fallout  and makes for similarly awkward and funny dialogues there is only two things that i can criticize but they are so minute that they are not worth typing out i cant wait to see if season  is just as good
first if all it looks absolutely perfect its so accurate to the games and the characters are as surreal as the games the storyline although not in line with any of the game plots is brilliantly conceived and suits the fallout universe i cant wait for the next season to see what it brings the thing i love about the series is the way that they utilise the choices made by each of the characters just like in the game there are decisions made that go against the obvious storyline and take the characters in an unusual but still viable direction the ghoul played by walton goggins is a great addition and his back story has been really good hoping we find out more as the story progressess overall its up there with the best game based conversions but on its own stands up as a modern and fresh series that delivers on multiple fronts funny full of suspense multi faceted plot lines loved it
i had doubts i tried to avoid hype i expected something mild more suitable for soft audience i am delighted that the series is nothing like that it is fallout in every way i dont care about noticing minor errors hell this is good it has atmosphere it is dark it has sense of humor gore whatever you would expect from a good fallout gamestory it is generally good i would say typical bethesda not the strongest point but well writtenwhy not i missed the even deeper darkness of the first two games it wasnt particularly cruel could go deepercould use somewhat slower pace more episodes more focus on individual characters they could have been deepermissing ncr flawsvaulttec storyline i dont want to spoiler here if you are a fan you will understand what i do refer herestill  is perfectly earned if you are fallout fan dont miss it
great writing great actors overall amazing really enjoyed it as a date night show with the mans absolutely cannot wait for season two we are on the edge of our seatslucy is a very compelling character all the characters are flawed yet have redeeming qualities it was great to watch their stories unfold ending made perfect sense yet wasnt guessable loved how they set it upi genuinely enjoyed every character one of the first shows were i enjoyed the flashbacks most tv shows i just roll my eyes and get through them this time i was deeply investedcounting down the days till season 
i love this show and the actors i am a big fan of this show not only because i love the video game but also because there isnt much video game movies that have done it right  also walton goggins aka shane is one of my favorite actors and this is a role he absolutely owned  i hope the directors go on to create more shows like these maybe bioshock or red dead  the set is also great and the costumes  the storyline is also very real and ties in to reality  im not done yet with the show but i dont even want it to end and hope for many more seasons maybe spin offs  and the acting from all the actors was great 
ive never played the fallout games but ive really enjoyed the show so far one of the big reasons for this is the characters they are well written with flaws and motivations that make sense for who they are and they fit into the world they inhabit lucy the main character is an excellent example of a great hero with a heart who has a lot of flaws to overcome on her journey and i am grateful the writers are actually letting a female character make mistakes and grow its a refreshing change from the boring characters being churned out by the big studios especially disneys star wars
we all prepared for the worst and it didnt comefallout tv show was kinda goodtheyve nailed the aestethic went a bit overboard with the music and had interesting characters they respected the games pretty much to a letterwalton goggins is great as always but i think ella purnell was the best one here while the characters were interesting i wished they were a bit more of everythingb plot inside the vault  is also solid but they did took their sweet damn time revealing it main plot is interesting and in tune with the gamesbiggest flaw is however that they just could not decide if this was a comedy or a serious drama then blending it both in a way that made it neither is it funny yeah but kinda not really is it very serious yeah it tries to be but its just not working sometimesit should have been a straight up comedy with serious elements here and there but nothing that cant be fixed in season however im pretty sure jonathan nolan and lisa joy duo as producers are mostly responsible for tone consistency problems like their previous potential tv hits  westworld and peripheral this can be driven into the ground like those shows as well most notably  westworld that started great and it went nowhere in the worst ways imaginable to the point that most people that stuck to the cancellation probably hate watched ithope they see the error of their ways or the big wigs above decide to can them and get some new people better suited for the jobyou should check this out
as an avid fallout fan since the release of the first game in  i must say that i was quite impressed by the first episode my review might change as i get deeper into the episodesapart from the last of us and twisted metal adapted from video games ive been rather disappointed by the recent sf novel adaptations silo beacon   bodies problem and i was a bit afraid that the tone and the atmosphere werent truthful to the video gamesthankfully the first episode was rather very impressive the music is exactly what you could expect and the different characters arcs are promisingif you have never heard of fallout before you will miss a lot of easter eggs and references as well as background and lore what are ghouls mutants why are people living in vaults etc but the overall quality and story might still be appealing to youi just regret that we didnt get to see a mutant rat and a radscorpion as a direct reference to the st fallout introduction but we might see them later
everything ties together so nicely of present and pastthe characters are built just nicely really good choice of songsthe juxtaposition of old songs with future world was humourous and ironicexcessive capitalism is explored till the point of god like decisions being takenthere was instances of bad cgi but this was over taken by the good designs of the gulpergiant roachesand the beautiful western accent of the ghoulan energy and resources control is still being waged by various factions vying for powerthe show was beautiful executed though we would love if more creaturess were shownmore of those giant machine suits being used and explanation for what powers them or where those ospreys wer getting their fuel fromeach episode was an hour long its obvious lots of thought went to itthis is loki style writing and we are all here for it
the first episode was a super ultra violent clockwork orange mess after that it tones down a little bit and get barely watchable however people who love the video games especially those who go back to fallout  probably wont agree with the storyline of thiscitizens of vault  are annoyingly california liberal you would want to kill them if you were stuck underground with them they are apologetic idiots concerned with stupid leftist garbage the mutants in vault  are preferable to the liberals even though they are doing evil experiments at least they arent liberal trash with mush for brainsone of the main characters the cowboy actor who turns ghoul starts out totally proamerican gets talked into some communist garbage by a communist acting buddythe whole storyline is one giant capitalism is evil communism is good propaganda line of complete bs so that pretty much ruins the series altogether there was no need to go down this stupid and ridiculous road valtec has to destroy the world since it made the vaults and blah blah blah evil corporate greed destroys the world blah blah blah and lots of empathy for the hollywood commie crowd because of course in this story they were correct blah blah blahso the eye candy is interesting a lot of the dialog is smut of garbage and not interesting and sometimes pointless story is kind of garbage really so the whole thing is meh so typical of something hollywood the real one in real life not the story one would produce and put out there hollywood these days has to ruin everything it touches includes stellar video game franchiseswatch for the eye candy if you want but it will destroy your love for the game franchise this show makes me hate the vault dwellers
they did a good job i was expecting this to be subpar for a number of reasons obviously tv spin offs of video games are historically mediocre at best up until recent years im also not typically a big fan of the shows on prime video so that made me a bit skepticalim not going to go on about the games because this will turn into an essay about why i love them so much instead of a review of the show but i would like to compare some things between the twoone of the things i have somewhat mixed feelings about is the tone of the show the tone is a bit different for each of the games fallout  and  and new vegas are brutal and dark and absurd and lonely but hilarious too fallout  felt more hopeful and colorful for better or worse the tone of the show feels closest to fallout  the show needed to be brutal and it needed to have the right kind of humor i think it almost nails it but i personally believe i would have preferred the bleaker tone of the original gamesthe other thing i had mixed feelings about was the ghouls and the way they became feral it felt too much like they were humans becoming zombies like they were trying to fight off a virus and theyre sort of being jolted in and out of control of themselves until theyre ulimately feral to me it makes more sense for ghouls to slowly transition into being feral where their cognition declines over time i realize this is kind of a nitpicky criticismi like the characters too i was expecting them to be one dimensional and on the nose but theyre actually interesting and have some depth to themits a good show its not my favorite show of all time but its a good spin off of my favorite video game series of all time and im happy with it
i tried to play fallout  back in the day but could never get to grips with game this didnt stop me loving the concept low and behold amazon makes a tv show about the game fallout i love post apocalyptic stuff and this ticks every boxits got that s vibe with a touch of futuristic dreams that the era so yearned forthe plot is sound and the characters are well thought out with twists as the show continuesyou might recognise a voice of one of the robots it took me a while to realise who it is but once you know the penny will dropover all this is the perfect way to spend an evening its  better than the boring walking dead
as a fan of the fallout series i was pleasantly surprised by just how good this show is the story is very compelling especially if you like the fallout lore which i do immensely it perfectly captures the tone and setting from the game series and has tons of great callbacks and references using its source material exceptionally well the characters were all incredibly well written and i legitimately like the entire main cast i am beyond happy that this show turned out to be as good as it is especially for a videogame adaptation i cant wait for the next season and i only hope the quality remains just as good as this first season this show is definitely worth watching even if you arent familiar with the fallout games and i highly recommend it
loved everything about it ella purnell is brilliant and carries the show her fellow cast supports her in the amazing performance that she gives as they too feed off of her energy and give an amazing view into this enthralling story i couldnt wait for her scenes as lucy made every moment a life changing step in her journey great story captivated at the very beginning the characters instantly draw you in making the series that much more intense ive never played the video game im  but i see the appeal and would love to try and play i love when lucy keeps getting called goosey such a great comedic relief to the intensity of the action packed scenes ive already recommended to all my friends who replied that they too had started watching the incredible new series i cant wait to see what happens next
i played fallout a couple years ago at that time the game had a unique atmosphere which you cannot find anywherethe tv show has it too its freakin hard to nail it but they managedevery little detail is polished to perfection we science fiction fans need more shows like thisthe storyline is simple but not too plainthe character development is visible and grounded i dont tend to overpraise or even rate here but this show deserves this minimumas several people praised before me the heroine is weak and naive im tired of seeing op characters everywhere this makes it much more human and believable
did it nailed the camera and aesthetics of the falloutyesdoes it has flaws yesare the cast goodyes  they are awesome every single oneis it too short to have hundred hours genregames cramped into  hours of footageyes the universe is massive and the games have hundred of hours worth of materialdoes it follow the gamesjust aesthetics and timeline takes place years after the events of fallout is it a good package that introduced fans and newcomers of the worldyes  it does not disappointi enjoyed the first season  im not an avid fan i played on occasions  new vegas and  i did not replayed the games for hundred of hours with over  mods eachbring on season  with the new vegas story and see how things with a bigger budget maybe with more episodes  i hope and with the experience of s will be one of the best new shows of the year
yes i havent played the game ive heard of it but i went into this completely blind i had no background context and most definitely did not get any jabs to the game but i did enjoy it i found it was really wellpaced it didnt rush into anything and allowed me to understand the plot which i wouldve gotten almost instantly if i knew the lore of the game i thought the costume design was great and so was the set design however i found the dialogue between lucy and max extremely awkward and their romance was tedious i dont think they had much of a spark at all kyle maclachlan is bae
as a gamer i find it pretty embarrassing looking at some of the  or  star reviews that seem based on idealised visions of a game from  years ago its not  folks you can step out of vault  and look at the world around you and see how it has evolvedplacing the games to one side this is a highly enjoyable series the main cast members are great in their respective roles  i particularly enjoyed walton goggins but all three inhabit their characters well the large array of side characters also provide plenty of interest and theres some really tight performances throughout the  episodesthe visual effects range from stellar to just acceptable this is a tv programme though and not a m hour blockbuster movie so it may be advantageous to set your expectations accordinglyill keep my fingers crossed that this is received well by the general viewership and that we can see this pushing into further seasons  itd be a real shame if the opinions of some reviewbombing or gatekeeping gamers affected the future of this satisfying show
"not as expected
watched  episode and yet non of them makes you to watch next  you can leave easily on any point of the story
story and character didnt grab youno thrill or excitement
if you dont have any choice for time pass then you can go for iti was really waiting for this but it is really disappointingso many things doesnt sense at all but we can accept that because its made from video gameno thrill or excitement
if you dont have any choice for time pass then you can go for iti was really waiting for this but it is really disappointingso many things doesnt sense at all but we can accept that because its made from video game"
how this piece of trash has garnered as many high reviews completely mystifies me this series has absolutely nothing going for i would give it a negative rating if i couldas far as im able to perceive there is no writing talent on display the plot is a long tedious predictable patchwork of cliches with absolutely zero new or compelling the writers appear to have attempted to substitute weirdness here and there to compensate for their lack of ideas and skill and in so doing only create boredomthere are several clumsily intertwined subplots which all resolve in thuds in the last episode no plot twists a moderately intelligent view couldnt predict from the first quarter of episode  there is no compelling character development but whats even more astonishing and appalling is that over the course of  full length episodes the writers fail to establish even one convincing personal relationshipthere is gratuitous gore and an abundance of stylized fight scenes that are as pointless and unimaginative as they are boring to sit throughif i may indulge a speculation the writing in this series reminds me of a period a few decades ago when the us movie industry reached a low point and many writers and actors were struggling with drug addiction and alcoholism it became something of a joke when yet another hollywood figure checked into the betty ford center for exhaustion and a number of them died very young in those days people writing really weird incompetent scripts while they were high became a common problem is something like that happening again i watch so many truly weird movies these days that have inexplicably little going for them especially given the substantial budgets behind themeven ella purnells grace and beauty is wasted as shes put opposite the decidedly dull aaron moten whos character is weaselly and emasculated and portrayed with as much charm and charisma as cold molasses leaking from a rusty can if there was any chemstry between these two it must have ended up on the editing room floor it would have made a difference if he could at least occasionally make a facial expression perhaps one might make a study of characters like han solo whose less than perfect character did not prevent him from having charm masculinity or attractivenessthen theres the music both the relentless period music and the abysmal score detracted from this film to the point where i think id rather have watched a remix with all music removed theres a weird retro aspect to this movie that they are catering to but really how much s music and johnny cash do they think a contemporary viewer has the patience for
im a lifelong bethesda gamer and let me tell you the amount of time and money spent on this show is top notch the costumes to the set design looks just like the game and more theres nothing can say that this show needs it covers every aspect makes me want to go play fallout againhumors gore drama and great acting from all sides beautiful scenery and great story line i was hooked from beginning to end i actually watched them all in one day not a dull momentif you have never played the video game or video games at all for that matter it wont make a difference a lot of action and hilarity ensue
one of the best video game adaptations i have ever seen i played the game for hour and hours and hours seeing it come to life seeing the characters come to life was wonderful it was really cool to see all these details from the games appear in the show seeing the backstories of the characters i would watch  episodes of thisi cannot praise this show enoughblast from the past meets walking dead meets billy the kidthe prosthetics are really great the shooting locations added to the ss vibes as did the wardrobeif you are a fan of the games i definitely recommend checking this show out
ya like straight up dont listen to the haters this show has potential to be one of the best potential series of all time having the story be based on the world of fallout and not any specific game only works if quality characters and plot are present this show is that much brilliant in more the soundtrack and is elite and you will get goosebumps watching so many different moments honestly it gives severance and breaking bad vibes no idea why must watch and when all is said and done may very well be in the hall of fame  all time best list the acting is at one of the highest levels i have ever seen watch a television show or movie
"this will become the best tv show in history 👏
as long as they do a big mt episode or sierra madre episode patrolling the mojave almost makes me wish for a nuclear winter theres so many amazing and bizarre character they can opt for hundreds of paths to chose from the games are great and were originally influenced by s novels and movies so a tv adaptation will and has thus far worked very well i have always been hopeful for a tv show of my favourite game series and its a delight to see it come true in my life time the cast are perfect 👌 the script is perfect 👌 the timing is perfect 👌 i can not wait to see what season  has to offer happy trails kiddos"
this series is truly remarkable offering an immersive experience filled with captivating plots and events that keep you engaged throughout its like stepping into a dynamic world where every moment feels alive the jazz music particularly the main theme adds another layer of charm and atmosphere to the storytelling even if youre not familiar with the fallout game franchise i highly recommend giving this series a watch its blend of compelling narrative and memorable soundtrack ensures an unforgettable viewing experiencehopefully the producers are working on a new season because we want more
i had really low expectations but was pleasantly surprised how good it was i have no complaints couldnt have been done better both true to lore and a genuine intriguing show for those not familiar with the games the costume scenery music everything is well thought out the acting is also very top notch they managed to snag the dark humor aspect as well so glad that the power armor part isnt pure cgi really looks great same with ghouls yuan gao and scenery hope this sets a trend for more great adaptationsi dont want to set the world on fire baby i just want to start a flame in your heart
this series is based on the game of the same name i didnt play the game and the series was exciting and fun for me the series shows the future when the world has been destroyed due to nuclear wars and the majority of its population has been destroyed and only a part of the earths population who were previously in special shelters have been saved the story starts with a certain excitement and this excitement continues throughout the story the characterization of the main actors is done well the struggle between the survivors for survival is well and excitingly shown the future of the earth with these people will be very terrible
this show is up there with the last of us and arcane as proof that video games can be adapted to tv shows successfully as long as you treat the source material with respecti dont know the games well enough to comment on the small details but from what i do know of them jonathan nolan and co have definitely got the world right it feels very authentic to the games capturing the awe every player feels on exiting the vault for the first time on seeing the destruction of the wider world around the vault on discovering the various settlements on encountering the various weirdos around the wastelandtaking the route of creating a wholly new story within the established world of fallout was definitely the best creative decision they made herethe cast are incredible too from relative unknowns to me at least like aaron moten maximus and moisés arias norm maclean to betterknowns to me again like zach cherry woody leslie uggams betty sarita choudhury moldaver and ella purnell lucy maclean all the way up to the iconic kyle maclachlan hank maclean and walton goggins the ghoul everyone is impeccably cast and each plays their role perfectlythe story itself is really good with the three distinct journeys  lucys the ghouls and maximus  being woven together brilliantly at times while also getting enough room to breathe and build on their own i cant wait to see what this series has planned for the future i only wish it was a couple of episodes longer
first of all let me tell you that im a big fan of the classic fallouts it all started with the fallout  demo back in  now i wasnt particularly happy with how the franchise was handled after fallout  and thought id never see the world that i felt back then until this tv show that is i am blown away by the attention to detail the love that went into production the acting the music the dark humor the horror of a postnuclear world bravo to the whole team i am sure the forefathers of fallout and many older fans are applauding you right now i am currently on episode  but am excited to see where the followup episodes and further seasons take us
being a huge fallout fan and having played all games since fallout  i was a bit skeptical but when i started watching the series the attention to detail quickly captivated my curiosity maybe they really paid tribute to the gamesand yes they did in my opinion however there seems to be a main focus point on sex and breeding which in itself is fine but was never mainly important in the games also the fact that the first season is focused on bringing a head somewhere doesnt give me a fallout vibe it was never a main quest in any of the games or side quests that i played and combined with the first point i made about sex playing a major role it doesnt feel like a true fallout adaptationlike i said the attention to detail is amazing as well as the fact that most vaults were mainly used for experimentation i also love the charactersactors but somehow im still not sold even for fallout i think the first season is too much over the top and it needs some adjustingalso fusion cores dont last forever which they make it seem like in the series and civil ghouls never needed a medicine in the games they either became feral or stayed civil after the great war
except the effects this series is pure garbage storytelling action characters everything is faulty and amateurishi really have never seen something so badly made its a sort of slapstick farce enhanced by technologynothing links with anything there is a obscure barely discernable plot going on the characters have no real motivations the action flow is fractured and twisted without reason in fact one could analyze this piece of crap on how not to assemble a drama of any kindnow it has a  imdb rating this is atrociousfelt the need to log in here to write this even though i dont do reviews herewatch it on your own cost if you assign zero value to your personal time
other than maybe the fan series nuka break this is one of the best fallout adaptations would love to give this series a full  but it falls short explaining why this chapter of the brotherhood is so different from the ones we know although season  can easily remedy this and why the ghouls appear so nearly human the series gives fans a lot to enjoy with incredible set designs and great casting as well as making itself easy for nonfans to step into the world the decision to make the three protagonists represent the levels of lore knowledge of viewers was a nice touch giving everyone at least one character to relate with and helps those with or without familiarity to source material mainly the games hop in
its fallouts jokes rather than its plot that make it one of the most faithful  and best  video game adaptations the show focuses on lucy maclean  a young woman who grew up in an underground bunker vault  which sheltered her ancestors from nuclear war when her father goes missing she leaves the safety of the bunker to rescue him the tone the visuals the meticulous attention to the detail of the game world is a far cry from some other adaptationswhichwillnotbenamed that try to completely blaze their own path this is extraordinarily faithful to the games while not being a straight adaptation of any one game in particular even if it shares at least one central baseline a vault dweller must head to the surface and find their father
this show should be a blueprint of how to make video game tv shows work this is how new nongaming audience is engaged to a show i had never played the game but after watching the show i want topurnell is amazing as vaultie goggins as ghoul delivers absolute gold as always i have been a fan of his ever since i saw justified maximus actor was decentish and not great as his acting felt kinda missing somethingthe script for most part was decent with good emotional and comedic bits dialogues are good for most of the show cgi looked choppy sometimes but it is not that bad over all a good show and a must watchwell done all
im a fallout fan albeit not hardcore i played fallout   and new vegas only partially for new vegasim not however a die hard fan knowing the exact timelines there was someone complaining about continuity for example as caps were no longer the currency when the series happen but really who caresaesthetically game borrows heavily from fallout  with a bit of overexposed visuals but with dark and witty humor and gruesome deaths that is the core essence of fallout and that part is nailed the story is decent and there no major plotholes with the occasional twist the interesting aspect is there are no real baddies and just people trying to survive so at many points in the series you can relate to different characters this in my opinion makes for good televisionthe story conclusion with the major reveal was a slight letdown and i wish they wouldve went a more bold route but my guess is the writers tried to appeal a broader audience and get more people hooked uptldr series captures the fallout element and stands on its own as smart television with good twists good character development  presentation and some moral questions here and there for the audience good witty and dark humor fallout stylethe ending couldve been a bit better but it was a satisfying conclusion to the season bonus points for finishing the story and not ending the season in a cliffhanger
"as a life long fallout fan this series ticks every box available the tone storyline setting etc makes you feel part of the video game but for those who havent been lucky enough to play the games theres plenty on offer to cater for all audiencesthe constant yet subtle nods to the game series makes me smile the fantastic level humour makes me laugh out loud and all the gory action and storyline is the perfect tool to stitch the story together in a way that stays true to the game but by providing a fresh new story at the same timethe characters are well cast which makes each scene perfection the action is gory but it adds to the overall tone which i love  the storyline is well written and will make
you want to binge the whole series i have  episodes left at time of writing"
im a giant fan of fallout video rpg game ive logged hundreds hours into fallout  game and just absolutely dig the world bethesda has created today we crave more and more of a good show so much so that our culture defines this obsession as binging a term often used to describe a multiday drug bender that now reflects the quality of a good showwell this isnt just good its binge worthy and then someits what myself and every other fallout player have dreamed of a completely original story set in the fallout universe and we get to start with the bloody mess perkthis is a dark violent and emotional series with enough humor and romance to even it all out making sure that every element of good storytelling is there and that it all takes place in both the wasteland and the vault this is a hardr rated series with gore cursing sex nudity the whole lot but not in a way that feels exploitative for its own sake just in a future postapocalyptic los angeles brought about by nuclear decimation citizens must live in underground bunkers to protect themselves from radiation mutants and banditsella purnell in fallout all the people living in these underground communities are forced to come up and live ella purcell stars as lucy one of the people whos never been above ground before and wasnt prepared for the lawless society it has become one of the most underrated actress i seen in some time she has great comedic timing  charm and grit looking forward to whats to come and so far its good i highly recommend it fallout fan or notthey nailed the vibe spot on and the story and characters are well cast 
after watching the first season i can say it was welldone of high quality and enjoyable enoughperhaps i was not the target audience or perhaps everything was too foreshadowed such that i dont recall being surprised by anything or perhaps it was the times the show seemed to break its own rules i am not sure but i dont feel as impressed as i should be which is weirdi will still check out season  and did enjoy it the quality is certainly worthy of the  score it currently has but  it just feels like something was missing its hard to say but i really only enjoyed it like a  or  out of still check it out people seem to love it
"ever since the show was announced i was waiting for it  i love bethesda games grew up playing skyrim but never tried out a fallout  but man this show was amazing from the start till the end tying all the plot and giving each and every character a purpose its a trio linear story which gets tied to each other with several twists and turns  ghoul is the best  lucy is amazing the actor who played lucy perfectly executed the role lucys reaction to several surface stuff which shes seeing for the first time gets her soo surprised yet shes eager to find her dad without giving up is great  and the development of a regular apprentice soldier to a sword  nd in command to a literal legion army a faction called brotherhood of steel  the twists and turns leading to a great finale which shows both the past and the present before the bomb dropped fallout has done it  it could have had more content even tho it was already entertaining it just made me want more of that dystopian world  i started playing the games enjoying every bit waiting for a second season
cheers"
the sets and the vibe do a great job at capturing the essence of fallout the ghoul and norm are carrying the show on their back in my opinion the show has some great scenes but there is room for improvement with writing directing acting and actor choicesa major gripe of mine is the pacing in many scenes for example one of many the scene in episode eight between lucy and her dad where he is asking her to go home with him lasted way too long we get it shes devastated and isnt sure what to do but the scene didnt need to be dragged out to get that point across these awkwardly long scenes can cost the dramatic effect they are trying to achieve also timing between dialog and characters were bungled from time to time for instance all of thaddeuss dialog felt awkward and it seemed as if the actor hasnt performed a day in his life it was immersion breakinganother immersion breaking constant was aaron moten maximus this main character is given the least amount of backstory in this season and his character comes off childish and inept in turn his scenes with lucy and other characters are off putting as if the actor is deciding scene to scene how hes going to play his character and it comes across as lacking consistency i was unable to tell if aaron is just a bad actor or the show needs better directorsfight scenes were clunky at times the injected humor in scenes didnt come across the way i think the show intended but i can let that slidehowever overall i feel they did a good job and would like to see where they go in season 
so many reviews saying amazon hit it out of the park actually a suspicious amount with that same headline but what exactly did they watch because it wasnt fallout about the only thing they got right was the look and feel of the environment from the games  the vaults look like they came straight from the game so i give them kudos for that otherwise the plot was so bland and uninteresting that each successive episode held my interest less and less until by about the th episode i felt that i was watching it because i was potcommitted by the finale i had it on more as background noise the characters are terrible sans walton goggins who is great in everything although even his character wasnt that captivating the main character lucy is just too gee aw shucks to care about and maximus storyline was numbingly zzzinducing will there be a season  probably based on the end of the last episode but this one is better left in the fallout shelter
this series opens in a time that looks very like the s shortly before rising tensions lead to nuclear destruction moving forward two hundred years we find ourselves in vault  one of a number of subterranean structures where the lucky few survived and their descendants await the day that it will be safe to return to the surface and rebuild america when outsiders manage to enter the vault and kidnap its leader his daughter lucy heads out into the wasteland hoping to find him here she will encounter many dangers at the same time maximus a squire in the brotherhood of steel is given the task of assisting the mechsuited knight titus on a mission to capture a certain individual when titus is killed maximus dons the armour and continues the mission also looking for the individual is a bounty hunter known as the ghoul events will lead to these three crossing paths as more is discovered about the world they inhabit things they dont realise themselves back in vault  lucys brother norm gradually learns further facts about the people that run their livesive not played the game so have no preconceived ideas about what the show should look like i cant say whether that is for the better or worse but i can say i really enjoyed it it quickly and effectively introduced key characters and the world they inhabit and the story moves at a good pace every episode provides plenty of tension and fairly violent action as well as interesting revelations such a story could easily take itself too seriously but this manages to provide plenty of laugh out loud moments i thought the cast did a fine job bringing their characters to life the sets and locations are great the vaults have a believable look and the locations have a suitably abandoned look this might be because in at least one case the real longabandoned town of kolmanskop in namibia is used similarly i liked the use of mostly physical special effects rather than the cgi more modern films and shows use the retro soundtrack was fun and added to the feel of the action especially when a light song played over more violent moments overall id definitely recommend this to fans of postapocalyptic scifi whether youve played the games or not i cant wait for season two
i never really played fallout but lately movie adaptations of games have been very hit  miss i cant speak about lore accuracy but in terms of story telling visuals character development etc etc i would honestly say this is almost as good as the last of us series adaptation wasvery fun show most of the time youre moved between  perspectives from  very different characters that cross paths  have their problems  victories together but the main reason that this works is that youre getting to know the world that fallout is in from significantly different angles which is a much nicer way to experience a narrative rather than having  person exposition dump everything on you as a lot of other shows do
im going to preface this by saying that prior to watching this series i had never played a fallout game not really i had downloaded new vegas a year ago at the insistence of one of my old friends then proceeded to go through the intro and hang around in the desert for awhile shooting random thingsin other words im not a gamer by any means but this series was so gripping and brilliantly put together that it inspired me to play the games just by the strength of the narrative alone and i feel like im not the only oneeven if i didnt grow up with any kind of console which may make me something of a dinosaur among millenialsgen zers i appreciated that gaming as a hobby came with a series of benefits it challenges kids to develop strategic thinking it improves coordination and reaction time but now because of this series i can appreciate it for something else as a means of storytellingthe pilot episode shows cooper howard played by walton goggins and later known as the ghoul entertaining young children at a birthday party after a brief conversation with his young daughter a nuclear bomb is dropped on the city and he flees with her in her arms the clothing and hairstyles had a s sort of aesthetic which had me thinking that the story was meant to be alternate history not to mention the constant fear of a nuclear holocaust which defined the cold war eraafter jumping ahead  years the story follows three main characters lucy mclean a young woman raised in a vault whose moral compass often overrides her survival instinct aspirant maximus a reluctant member of the brotherhood of steel who finds himself assigned to a mission out in the wasteland and the ghoul now a bounty hunter who has fully embraced his oncefabricated cowboy personai had questions a lot of questionsone doesnt have to look far to appreciate the real events that inspired the story chernobyl hiroshima nagasaki the fear of humans destroying themselves as opposed to being destroyed by an outside force ie an act of god is especially interesting because no matter what method is used it would never be absolute those who survived the holocaust that wiped out  of life on earth risk being turned into something barely recognized as human through radiation poisoning the vaults while supposedly designed to sustain life for centuries would eventually run out of resources and had already found ways to poison their moral framework long beforethe acting was superb on all fronts as was the script theres a particularly great piece of dialogue between cooper howard and his wife barbara which encapsulates a large part of the franchises social commentary what good is preserving life if you lose everything that makes life worth livingnone of the characters are truly perfect and the story doesnt always go where you expect it to it mixes classic scifi thrills with just the right amount of dark comedynow to beat fallout  before season  comes out next year i cant wait
yeah this is easily in my opinion at least the best video game adaptation i have ever had the pleasure of watching unfold in real time i have always been a fan of the fallout franchise ever since i played fallout three on the xbox  and to see this vast and interesting world come to life on the screen is incredible and i genuinely loved every single second of it some of the most inherently bizarre and beautiful visuals ive ever seen in a television show i mean dude look at the power armor thats insane plus every creature looks fantastic most specifically the ghoul played by the spectacular walton goggins who is the best part of the show by far although the rest of the actors here are stellar as well kyle mclachlan of twin peaks fame has very little screen time but he uses what he has to its fullest ella purcell absolutely kills it as lucy and this is the second video game adaptation she has been in thats amazing plus aaron clifton is absolutely hilarious while also somehow badass as maximus this is wholeheartedly the best thing ive seen come out this year either show movie or game plus easily the best video game adaptation i have ever witnessed if you havent started this i highly recommend you start now its peak
this is exactly how a gaming adaptation should be handled honoring the source material but creating your own story within the universe casting was well done and it was clear a lot of work was put into the writing no cheesy one liners or throw away scenes everything shown contributed to the narrative and world building character arcs were completed and all character interactions had meaning great show over all cant wait for season  the producers for halo should be taking notes it is possible to keep the gaming community happy while also creating your own story and appealing to a wider audience
im not a fan of the game but uupon watching two episodes of fallout i was surprised to find it receiving such high praise in the imbd ratings score however my experience thus far has left me underwhelmed one of my main gripes with the series is its reliance on lowtech elements which seems out of place in a science fiction setting the technology particularly the suits worn by the knights feels outdated and lacks the innovation one would expect while the initial introduction of the knights was impressive it ultimately fell short of my expectations i had hoped for a more captivating experience but unfortunately i found myself disappointed by the lackluster performance in these first two episodes so far its watchable i will watch the remaining episodes
cheesy b tier script in first  can easily be looked past if youre a fan of the gamesthe bethesda incarnation fallout world and flavour has been captured pretty much perfectly fan service is basically baked in and isnt rammed in your facebrotherhood and vault lines are ok basically the sort of thing youd expect from the games but the ghoul storyline is actually pretty damn compelling and elevates the whole thing imofinal  actually ramps up the story into something interesting while hitting all the classic fallout tropes of daddy issues and the grey morality of each factions ideologyseason  has the potential to claw its way into a tier if they keep pushingmassively surprised cant wait
ive got them all and played them all so i was hyper upon finding out there is a series comingthey did an awesome job in replicating the details onscreen from the gamethe vault the world the music the outfits its all  and the bos armor loved itthe story is very well done and it will take you all the way though the first season before youfind out what its all about i liked that walton goggins nobody could have portrait the ghoul better than him his performance is fantastic unfortunately i cant say the same for ella purnell and aaron moten i thought their performances were very cringe would i recommend this absolutely
st main protagonist male griefing whitehis child exceptionally bright and brave mixed race for no reason except thats how it works today compare eg the last of usnd main protagonist jovial and resilient female whitefather figure wise and kind on his way out whiteall younger men weak or intimated by life whitefirst villain female ethnically ambiguousrd main protagonist troubled past has issues with anger male blackbest friend of rd protagonist tough and sly of ambiguous gender latinalrighty folks this is really swell now that weve went through the mandatory checklist lets get on with the story to have as many random scenes as possible we will split one narrative up into four understood we will make it fit later on in the editing room dont think of it as a conventional story or four conventional stories for that matter its more like snapshots of that trademarked fallout feelingwhats that speak up if you wanna say something son what no todd it does not matter if the writing is full of plotholes so big they are actually safety hazards main thing to keep in mind is that were dealing with a hypernervous gamers here anyway and they just cant cope with long introductions and thoughtful setups we have to make as many cuts as possible and also introduce a couple of dozen more characters yes todd im sure about it after all my yearold does play fortnite so i know a thing or two about the mind of a gamermeanwhile the gamer proceeds to play a random fallout title in which the main story alone is about  hours long and happily immerses themselves into the world and theres nothing they hate more than bad action cheap graphics stiff dialogue and getting rushed through the story while at the same time being held up with trivial fetch questsedit my oh my it actually gets worse i already wondered where the asian typecast was and then they have that tinkery nerdy woman who likes science and stuff guess what ethnicity they chose for that character its a very different kind of racism we are in the process of developing and it baffles me that nobody is offended by it also the writing gets worse and the camera is always moving around ever so slightly to mask that nothing is actually happening in the scene the choreography of the action is amateurish full of errors and overloaded with bad cgi i do like the actors and they certainly do their best esp ella purnell and aaron moten you can see they had fun delving into their characters but overall this is yet another series that is already massively overrated some other reviewers stated it succinctly this is much more a disney production than anything elseedit a lot of people out there relegate the bad reviews to gamer rage funnily enough there arent that many  reviews out there and much more inflated s and s and whats even more curious if you go to the respective forums you can easily see that fallout fans actually love the adaption because it is truthful and full of hidden lore but i am not only a fallout fan but also a fan of great tv shows and this one is simply not one of them
ive played all fallout games except fallout  new vegas and fallout  had the best written smartest most intriguing stories the fallout tv series rivals those in complexity smart character development and skillful twists the character arcs buildup and conclusions for each of the  main characters is almost perfect its so refreshing to see a wellwritten female character as well as a complex interesting black characterthe only reason i dont give it a  is the lack of the brilliant dark humour that fallout   and new vegas had there are some attempts but they didnt get a chuckle out of me as much as the games didstill one of the best pieces of entertainment on tv in the recent years right up there with arcane and shogun
wow just wow ive played every fallout game and gotta say this for a first season was outstanding the story loosely based on the game was gripping the chosen characters brilliant the soundtrack is amazing and i cant wait for season  even if you have never played the games just sit back hit play and become mesmerized by how the world would look after a nuclear holocaustthe main characters are acted out superbly and the ghoul is just the best casting ever absolute genius i binged the whole series and will watch again please release an album soundtracknow prime please pick up mega city as this deserves the same treatment
i been long time player of the games loving every scary moment and laughed with every corny joke loving the music i was scared when i learned there was going to make a series of it specially when its launched on prime they usually gut everything out of a series and make it watered down nothingnessnot this time it was everything one could expect awesomeness  storyline drama  scary ghouls etcthe only thing i am somewhat sceptical to is the distance how could one walk from philadelphia to los angeles or new las vegas in matter of minutes it should take weeks but thats just the one tiny remark thats making it not 
the original was full of dark humor and well crafted situations this does that and wraps it up in an intriguing package complete with character arcs there are things that are very different than from in the game but that just means a clean slate with which to create an admirable story and i appreciate that as a fan of the game series i am very elated to hear that it is doing so well in the ratings the original creators were imagination powerhouses of the gaming industry there is plenty of meat on the bone to have gotten creative with for a series the actors were all pretty amazing and i never knew what to expect next just the way i like my shows
im super super impressed with the series so far start off the storyline amazingthe attention to detail is phenomenal everything that you see know and love in the game is in the serieseverything from weaponsgearfoodclothing building and landmarks are exactly the same as the gamemy jaw dropped at the amazing detailsthe acting in this is amazing i love every character big and small in this they all do an amazing job amazing 👏by the looks of the ending of episode  hopefully means there is going to be a season  heading towards my favorite game in the series new vegas with death clawsi pray that it happens and in a timely fashionon top of this being amazingly stunning a look at season  teaser looks like its going to top what we see in season i do wish season had more than  episodesseems to be the trend no a dayswhen i was a kid in s early s seasons had episodes got your moneys worthgrant it those shows probably didnt cost as much to make but still love more than  episodes
this is such an awesome show its not as i expected at all even after seeing the trailerslet me start out by saying this is all comedy this is not a serious show and it doesnt try to be it is however the most fun ive had watching tv in a long time so many little funny things that ill have to and watch it again in a few weeks i bet ive missed a bunchwith out spoiling anything early on we have a sex scene where the guy afterwards gets up and causally wipes his meat torpedo in the curtains and in another scene the camera pans over a bunch of bunks in a military camp and one recruit is polishing his gun under the blanket its just out to the side so many will probably miss it theres so many of these silly and hilarious scenes and they are often placed in the backgroundbesides that the casts performance is very good indeed especially walton goggins is incredible  hes definitely maxed out his charisma statsthen we have the music this is probably my favourite soundtrack from any show having a massive shootout while johnny cash is blasting from the speakers is just awesomeand thats probably the best part of the show the way they have captured the atmosphere from the games it feels like a funny version of fallout to finish id just like to repeat how awesome goggins is as the ghoul if they make a spinoff about his character id be the first to watch it
i was bored for the first three episodes kind of like the game the lameness of vault life and the initial leaving of the vault is slow the story did a good job of building up the mystery of the vault experiments i loved the ghoul character props to walton gibbens they did a really good job of sticking to the source materials the games i almost felt like i was playing the next fallout game while watching the lead did an amazing job of being both the naive vault dweller and a capable survivor my only advice to the team is to speed up things a bit i am looking forward to the next season
ill be first to say that i am viewing this through rose tinted glasses the show is full of wonderful set pieces with tons of background details they captured the essence of fallout which to some is probably off putting or hard to follow many lore specific details have been modified or removed for brevity and audience understanding this doesnt take much from the quality of the show too much though the plot is rather simplistic and some of the twists are rather easy to see coming and seasoned scifi enthusiists might find the show too easy to follow the actors were well chosen acting skill varies but most were good enough walter goggins steals the show in this aspect purnell preformed well as a convincing vault dweller the cgi was not the best in the industry but only rarely took me out of the experience the only big qualm i have with the show is that at times the grim humor so beloved in the games borders on too humorous and at times outlandish
i am surprised at the  and  star reviews here i was awaiting this series after seeing a trailer for it a while back i have played all of the fallout games so i knew i would like this series i loved the scenes with lucy the vaults and the brotherhood my lower review score is due to way too much time spent on the ghouls story i didnt time it but it seemed like he had way more time spent on him than anything elseit came to a point where i began fast forwarding his slow long winded scenes i was hoping that lucy would have kept exploring and picking up the cool weapons and encountering more of the creatures we see from the games the very last scene was very predictable but i wont mention it since i dont want to spoil it for others i have yet seen a prime series that i like have a complete series so i wouldnt be surprised if this only lasts for one or two seasons
"yea the special effects arent bad it all looks good and for a change the acting aint that bad either but as per usual for amazon the writing simply is bad so its just really hard to take it seriouslyjust aint buying it that vault  and  has regular meetings and trades but none of the higher ups notice that they dont know a single one of the people coming over for the tradeim sorry but you have interacted and traded with these people all your lives and all of suddenly all of the ones coming over are completely new faces and no one gets suspiciousand the bad guys make it into the armory instantlyits just typical bad things happen because they need it to happen for shock value dosnt matter if it makes any sense or not
dont bother making a show if you are not going to put any effort into the writing"
fallout mainly takes place more than  years in the future after what was apparently an allout nuclear war in the s there are several extended flashbacks to events in the s leading to the nuclear apocalypse the postapocalypse world is quite complicated with several different factions and groups competing with each other some characters have managed to survive the entire  year period from the initial apocalypse to the present time of the show there are many great songs from the s and s in the show two of the main characters lucy and maximus are absolutely delightful and often very funny there are many very funny scenes and dialogue here in addition the show is wellplotted with many mysteries that are gradually unraveled the final show of the first season leaves open several plot questions so hopefully we can look forward to another season or two the only negatives are that the physical appearance of the ghouls is horrifying and disgusting the other negative is too many gun battles with people getting their heads blown off and etc
generally its a very well done show hard to see such thing these days quite entertaining it basically mixes all the genres you can think of fantasy soap opera crime mystery thriller you name it writing is very good although there are here and there plot holes and illogical moments the big budget shows but never stands in the way of story telling music selection is great reminds me of bioshock games  nad  which came  years later directions and editing are done routinely but consistently well well done casting and acting though i tried to play this game once but gave up after a few hours i believe it was  but forgot the game was not my cup of tea  too open world too many dialogues too many quests and so on everything too many for my taste including bugs in the game this shows borrows the sceneryvisuals and overall atmosphere but brings a partly original story leaving a lot of space for many more episodesseasons which im looking forward to very entertaining and immersive much better than the game obviously such story is better suited for the tvshow not the game but thats a personal opinion highly recommended regardless of games origin
this is so good literally watched the whole season in a day and a half i couldnt quit my only question is where were the death claws they are a big part of the game and i honestly dont remember seeing one in the show but other than that the show is fantastic the way they depict the brotherhood of steel the unknowing vault dwellers the crazy npcs you run into in the game they nailed it so good so if you are wanting to watch a great adaptation of a game this right here is it i mean they literally nailed it the ghouls are even spot onblood gore dismemberment rad roach delight
ive never been a particular fan of the fallout games however this series is fire the acting the story the aesthetic everything about it is just spot on and they took no liberties with making it some political statement they made it for the purity of the series and it really showsso this is a story about a post nuclear world there are a few factions worth mentioning the vaulters would be the people who were in the vault during the blast the ghouls are the people who were not in the vault but through chemical intervention basically survived the blast and live on turning into a form of zombie without the chemicals they need to keep them alive and everyone else is some kind of faction of human trying to perfect their version of what the new world should be im not going to get into more details than that because of spoilers but this is a must watch everything was perfect for what this show is we need more like this
as the name implies the fallout out of men and women alike including something cringe meh i thought of this series as a low budget series with a wacky backstory for a series but men did it brought out the best package in each episode like a surprise to a kids birthday party in fact ive got to admit the best series of the moment until the resume of the boys and other totally knockout series in production right now i thought i came to the conclusion that ive seen it all but this story packs something different though one will understand as one sees the difference in the making both the story and the characters uniqueness and comparison can be dated on some odd factors seeing how many contradictory events came to play but that makes it all the more enjoyable its like sitting back relaxed and let them fallout with their entertainment for your pleasure i gotta say one of the best out there see it and live to tell the tale
before the series aired i never had much interest in watching since i never played the games despite being a big gamer thought it would just be another dud like the halo series on paramountafter seeing positive reviews on social media i decided to give the show a watch and low and behold i got hookedthe show has action humor good acting and beautiful shots and best of all the plot is very intriguing and gets better after each episode along with the writing that makes you care about the two main charactersthe show is not perfect but i would definitely recommend it i look forward to season  and really think prime has something special here if they expand on the good of the show
visually and comedically spot onthis series hits every note that identifies it as a fallout story the characters are quirky and colourful the landscape equally sothere are plenty of easter eggs to keep die hard fans happyhoweverthis series feels like it had several directors writers and creators fighting over it the result therefore makes for a somewhat jarring viewing experiencea lot of the comedy misses the mark and falls flat with characters saying some very odd things at odd timesmost of the scenes in vault  make no sense at allits definitely one of the better video game to screen adaptations however could have been a lot neater around the edges
i stopped watching the show midway through the nd episode the costumes and sets are absolutely perfect the cgi is also really good the actors do a commendable job with the script they were given but the script and directing killed the show for me i rarely knew what the character motivations were what their goals were the humor was not funny it was scripted and childish the pacing was very slow and seemed there only to connect events which were too cliche imo i really wanted to love like helleven be slightly entertained but i found myself wondering into the nd episode why i was wasting my time on another poorly directedscripted piece of entertainment this was a complete let down
if you are familiar with fallout this is how you would want to experience the tv adaptation most likely also a decent experience for those that are not familiar with the franchisecannot wait for season  they did not hold back with season  which kept the pace on with just the right amount of past and present storytelling plot lines intertwined in a way that made sense and none of them strayed off nor felt bloatedfallout universe has still a vast vat where the writers can summon epic and mad stories and from the bottom of my heart i hope to see many more episodes this is entertainment this is art im glad i got to live to see this
this tv series really did a great job with the whole aesthetic of the fallout universe the attention to detail is fantastic it even starts out like a game with the main character looking for her father the ghoul really stole the show definitely my favourite characterthe story and events could easily come from one of the games the happygolucky s vibe interspersed with violence from deadly serious to silly and back again just like the game bear in mind that most series take a few seasons to find their feet this is a great start and play the games if you havent you wont regret itreally looking forward to season two
this show proves that game adaptations can be done right and right here is probably my favourite adaptation i been a bethesda fan for years from elder scrolls to fallout to dishonored and many others but the fallout show is phenomenal it sets the tone of the post apocalyptic world perfectly lucy is a great character so is maximus but the stage light goes to the ghoul hands down the best character the show done well with keeping its source material making the pip boys look accurate to the vault tec uniforms the t power armor and other set pieces and i cannot wait to see what they do with season  especially with the end of season  and if youre a massive fan of fallout keep an eye out on easter eggs there are loads of them in the show fallout fan or not i highly recommend watching this show
ok so i am a huge fan of the games and have been playing them for years now this movie did an almost perfect job capturing the feel of the game the only thing i didnt like was how they did the brotherhood sure they are grade a aholes but they they did have a sense of honor and dedication to each other in the game in the show they are just aholes beyond that i couldnt get enough of it it was fun and action packed with a good story line disregard all the negative comments about the show as im sure those people just suck at life lol i loved the goul hands down the best character in the show brutal and selfserving but still somehow likeable the fault character lucy is down right perfect in her total innocence and makes for a ton of funny moments in the show
i have played fallout since the first instalment i was instantly taken in by the lore humour and storytelling in a way that showed me that computer games could be as compelling as the best films or tv showsfallout reverse engineers that premise bringing a computer game to the tv screen and it does so magnificently for those who care it captures the lore of fallout very wellit also captures politics brilliantlyits hyperbolic but thats what fallout always did well  exaggerates the worst of human instincts to display how bad we can bethis show leaves you with the feeling that there is something amiss about the world and something sinister under the surface its highly compelling the humour the weirdness of the games its all thereas a bonus the acting is mostly good to excellent and it has matt berry as codsworth so worth watching for those fleeting scenes aloneone of the best shows ive seen a masterpiece
didnt really know what to expect from this one i had only played a few hours of various games since i got them on sale did not really know much of the cast other than walton goggins who is a great actorthe story itself was well explained and cohesive which really brought out elements of the game such as dark humor music and npc interactions which created wonderful immersion in fantasyland of new california republic items and weapons were recreated in all their glory and stayed true to the game while pushing the boundaries i did find the backstory of the ghoul a bit dull and dragged out taking up huge portions of the show and is the only part which i didnt want to really watch more however it was worth it as his past was tied into the present actions if i were to rewatch this i would absolutely skip over the ghoul backstory sorry waltonthe one big issue i had with the show was the armor which had parts that were visibly wobbly and not well refined in some scenes despite being an iconic part of the universe like when they open the armor the circular opening hatch just jiggled and that could have been edited this is like having a wobby lightsabre or flaccid millennium falcon in star wars come on but the show catches your attention well with the dark humor ever prevalent in the games perhaps even better it would be equivalent to the last of us except that lucy doesnt exist in the games and jonathan nolan really was able to push the bounds of a new vault storyline best thing was it never felt like mission after mission but flowed well from lucy to the story unfolding inside the vault to piece together a big picture of how the apocalypse started and why chaos was happening all over the vaultsin this case i loved every bit of lucys journey through the post apocalyptic world that is vastly different than every other iteration on tvmovies today twd the  last of us z nation etc making it a refreshing change of pace the humor was great and the story hints at things that have happened or are happening in the world which were touched on in games i couldnt really get through the games which were slow and dull but finished the show in  days when it got towards the end i was ready for more they finished lucys mission and created this world with so much happening in the vaults over the globe and all of them could be a different story the reviews are plenty and speak for themselves i cant wait for the next seasons or spinoffs that the universe has to offer
ive watched the first  episodes and i started watching with great scepticism that it would be a starts good but fizzles out seriesi also like a good post apocalypse story this is definitely one of thosei gather its based on a game ive never seen the game but it does have an interesting game vibe that is appealing it doesnt take itself too seriously yet you are engrossed in the characters and their individual stories however bizarrenow i have to watch the remaining episodes and i do hope it continues to the same standard as the first  episodessolid  and may well increase to an  by the end very watchable
good music its nice that they got some of the songs from the fallout games good atmosphere nice setting with an new story set in the fallout universe but that maximus character has got to be the dumbest guy ever portrayed and ive seen home alone maybe they tried to make it funny but it isnt its cringe the main character is a dits but its normal because she grew up in a vault with everyone following that s atomic attitude all smiles and all rigid but thats how it should be also too bad we dont enough scavenging and looting of weapons and armour as in the games but thats ok
this show is very good and dont get me wrong with the title i did personally enjoy the show a lot however what kept me from giving the show a higher score was the amount of story decisions they made too fit the gamesthe way i see it there are positve and negative aspects to creating a complete original story based on the propertiy of fallout and i will explain my reasoningalso for refrence i am a big fallout fan and have played all fallout game entriesthe positives of making an original story is that it is a lot more engaging too watch if they had just adapted fallout  i wouldnt have been shocked at all over the ending or been as engaged in the show tho of course that is really hard to say so take that opinion with a grain of salt the point is you have the ability to tell a completely new and original story set in the universe which is a good thingall the references are really neat and its fun too hear the stimpack sound effect or hear the quest clear marker when you reach a location but some things were a bit cringe like the use of the famous line war never changes which just felt really shoehorned in near the endthe horror aspect is also something i am very confused by as none of the mainline entry games focus on the horror aspect however as a tv show i get that adapting the source material and interpreting it in such a way isnt necessarily a bad thing just very uniquethe bad parts come when discussing the story of the show there is a lot of focus on cold fusion and the politics of vaulttec which is something that again none of the mainline fallout games focus on and the whole concept of cold fusion is never mentioned in any of the fallout games fallout  might have the biggest influence on the show since the whole concept of lucy going out to save her dad is taken from the game which i dont like because fallout  easily has the worst story everthe ncr are poorly written and their backstory is quite interesting dating back to fallout  and  which gets thrown out the window here new vegas gets no love as well only showing the strip in the absolute end of the last episode which just seems like they are hyping it up for season  so well see where that takes us apart from that no ceasars legion no supermutants in fact the show never even mentions them but the biggest offense might be the enclave the enclave are the main villains of fallouts  and  and they are featured a little in fallout  as well but here they have practically no impact on the story just that the scientist guy escaped from the enclave which might be an allusion to a scientist from fallout  actually but thats beside the point they are basically not important too the story whatsoever in fact the brotherhood of steel are the only faction that are featured prominently in the show which is a bit of a weird decision since there are many factions that could have made it in new reno gangs vault city all the factions from san franciso arent mentioned like the hubologists and no fallout  factions like railroad or the synths brotherhood and enclave are pretty much in all fallout games so i guess it made sense to mention those but cmon there is also no geck but storywise i can understand why you wouldnt want to mention it its basically the equivilent of cold fusion in the showoverall some creative decisions werent my favourite tho i enjoyed the show a lot and wheter it was a faithful adaptation is up to interpretation on one hand it was simply adapting the universe which it did fairly well but on the other the factions the characters the locations are changed to fit the new creative narrative of the show which is a bit of a shame in my opinion i think the show would have benifited from adapting more of fallout  and  rather than  and  if that makes sensei cant wait for season  tho and i will definitely come back for more
the budget for this show was  million you could of given any fallout fan the budget and they would have made a better show in fact there already is a better fanmade fallout show and its called nuka break check it outobviously when a video game show or movie gets made fans are going to be upset because we already know it will be corporate slop thats not true to the game so no one or myself is really that surprised but the fallout universe is huge many games across many years and a plethora of lore to work withthey could have made an awesome show from the source material instead we get politically correct virtue signaling in a post apocalyptic setting with a fallout label slapped on itit lacks the raw gritty helplessness that the games are known for this show is more whimsical and probably would have been better as a new original ip without using the fallout name
fallout it seems that things are turning around for video game adaptions fallout manages to take the silly gruesome complex and chaotic world of the fallout games and turn it into a compelling tv show not a small feat if anything the amount of switching in tone this show has it couldve gone so much worsebut its delicate balance of funny silly awkward and gruesome is what makes this one of the more unique shows in a whileas a big fallout fan especially new vegas i had set a low bar for this how are they going to pull off such a massive world and such a weird one too having jonathan nolan behind it gave me some hope and goggins helps as always but still i gave it a low chance of succes behold my surprise when i binged it in a couple days this is a genuinely good show but it took some adjustingprimarily it leans into the silly much more and its foundation art direction and tone of voice lies in the fallout  game mainly which it a bit more silly than fallout  or nv who in general are a bit more serious gritty and more depressing as worldsdirecting is great so far i have some bad memories of westworld action scenes especially in later seasons nolan is not good at that because it was always a hilarious bullet fest that stood in awkward contrast to the rest of the show but in fallout first off the firefights and action scenes are perfectly good and the bit of silliness that they have works because of the universe it is set inand that takes me to the bit that i needed to adjust to this is by all aspect a video game tv show and it plays by video game rules as in it has a lot more comically unrealistic scenes whilst both being exceptionally gruesome and gorey therefore it might just be the best video game tv show adaption ever because its not trying to be real life its not trying to ground it in our realities it s creating a fictious world and fictious rules to align perfectly with the fictitious rules of games and gaming in general this is what i needed to accept and once i did i was really enjoying itmusic pretty perfect the expected scores effective when used for sure the oldies music really lands the show and puts it right inside the fallout universe i could sing all of them by heart the fact its the actual music you also hear in the games is icing on the cakethe story is a great way to show the diverse and huge world of fallout and weve yet touched the surface so much to explore and this gave a taste of each it could go on for a good whilelorewise minor changes here and there and mostly some creative choices in certain attitudes and portrayals but it all made sense to me none of it stuck out to me as betraying the games in terms of how things work the bos are a bit less cool than they should and more incompetent here but its only a division of it not the entire thing so its easy to look pastalso gore man they went all in and i love them for it fallout games are gorey and they dont stray one bit from that thats what this show is its honest to the game to an extend ive never seen beforethe pacing it moves along fast and characters do too fast travel what i didnt love as much was the coincidental nature of it all it made the world feel very small and compact when everyone seems to meet up around some random corner every odd episode if anything thats my complaint so far is that the world feels somewhat small and everything around tends to feel like set dressing very quicklythat being said for now season  they really delivered a good time and i cant wait for s
the first  episode season of fallout is great in so many ways the series is super fun its scifi fantasy style is perfect for this unrealistic retrofuturistic nuclear fallout setting the story and character building is done quick but still feels deep and attaches meaning to the characters backstories before we meet them the series quickly develops character that we are attached to without even knowing whythe bounty hunter cooper howard is introduced early in the first episode and ends up as these nuclearradiated immortal bounty hunter while we dont quite know his motives we are attracted to his unwinding storyline of hurting whoever gets in his way until we learn of his true motivesthis series is unique and well done its a fun watch but also with meaning and potential behinds it characters lucy maximus and even norm excited to see the direction of the future seasons and would love to see what other experiments have been taking place in fallout shelters
i have played video games for much of my life but never have played fallout and i ahave avoided reviews so i can take it in fresh well i am on board in a big waythe production values are great  settings distinct and admirably few of the normal dystopian cliches and the acting is top notch who cant appreciate walton goggins when he has sharp dialog reminiscent of justifiedi have not finished the series yet but felt compelled to write this review because its so nice to find new content that hits the markgamers who complain about changes  well i understandbut for noobs like myself it works and works really well
this is one of the best tv series ever fun quirky everything we love about the fallout series plenty of action plot twists all of the major characters have great chemistry and the supporting cast are magnificent great casting great writing and a lot of attention to detail you can tell that everybody involved actually played the games knew the source material and wrote a fun entertaining story the vaults the pipboys the wasteland creatures and characters are all done perfectly the special effects are seamless too from the power armor to the postapocalyptic landscape everything is perfect gory brutal but also quirky and sometimes downright funnyits great that amazon has given up the idea of force feeding us with boring selfrighteous political and social propaganda like a certain megaexpensive series that shall not be named and is actually back in the entertainment business
the environment characters music  everything is thereits hard to complain about the show because it is essentially a fallout game moved to a tvshowhaving said that in a game i can have more patience with some parts of the storytelling not matching up to others there is so much more to a game than the script that plays inbut in a tvshow it doesnt work to have part of the show feel unengaging or questionable at times every minute countsthe truth is that most of the time i am loving the show others i cringe or want to skip because frankly they arent keeping my interest or im not feeling the writingso far it also lacks moments that are truly inspiring that will stay with me for years to comeit is a great addition to the latest trend of games turned shows being good but it doesnt belong with the greats so fara solid

as a person who played every fallout game to completion including tactics this series has done a great job but there are some cringe momentsin the game sex was there but the act itself was an abstraction it was a pc game with a content rating in this series lucy just outing and asking anyone for sex was weird maximus not knowing what sex was but describing an erection he once had as a pimple was bizarre a group of female dwellers unzip their vault suits to the waist exposing themselves during a ceremony i laughed because it was so stupid i couldnt believe they just threw that scene in there checking off adult rating boxes could actually derail the story if the writers are not carefulsome errors in mismatched sets entering a vault through a building then exiting back into an arid desert the goul entering a  story farm house and exiting back through a different looking building sloppyoverall the story is good enough and i recommend to watch if you were a fan if fallout is new to you then you have to go with there are no integrated circuit chips yet alien fusion tech just showed up in this analog universe and it does make sense
if your interested in being taken on a strange journey through a strange world that will entertain you and make you laugh out loud at times then youll like this show theres no need to have played the games to enjoy this series the only thing im not really enjoying is the distracting music at times during certain scenes this seems like a fad these days with productions and i hope its a style that passes quicklyi disagree with people who say theres no one to route for or any character development as it seems pretty easy to route for the main character lady from the vault in any case im not the type of viewer who needs someone to route for in a show or a strong character development journey etc i think this show is doing a good job of telling the story of this world through its characters in an interesting way sometimes in a story the main character can be the world and the time period in which the characters are inhabiting also the story seems self aware in that its not a deep statement piece its entertainment and each scene delivers plenty of depth just from its weirdness and set design acting comedy gore etcanyway its a show that easily better than a run of the mill series on any platform in my opinion
season one didnt have me convinced in the first few episode when it embraced the western aspects more than the mystery but when you get information about the world its really amazing and the reveal doesnt disappoint the characters in the vault are a great representation of this aspect as they slowly discover how wrong the world is their stories was intriguing lucy is the character for me as we see her change through the season because of the dangerous adventures she goes through she starts off has an optimistic idiot and ends up broken maximus also had an intriguing story because of how unpredictable he is hes a good person but also a bit of a coward so his actions are fun to see unfold the ghoul was interesting but hes really shielded from exposure because his plotline needs to be flashbacks so as essential he is for the mystery i think he was slightly misused on the technical level the show is awesome the visuals were on point and the soundtrack slapsseason  
loved the cast and acting and the westworld ish vibes but with an appropriate comic book feelamazing score and nolanjoy world building ok with what i presume was a much smaller budget i get similar vibes occasionally especially with the walter goggins ghoul reminiscent of man in black hes so good and i really like the lead actress she has those big eyes and looks straight out of an animemy pet peeve is how did all those post apocalptic people keep their glasses crystal clearnot to mention clean hair i look like a hobo after two days without a showerim not a gamer so cant speak to how this reflects to the game lore
despite the good actors and attractive beginning unfortunately the scenario and the story are extremely farfetched and illogical i only saw the beginning of the first episode and i have a big question mark as to how they opened the gate without going through a simple security protocol to make sure there are no killers and looters on the other side i dont even open the door to my house without making sure who is behind the door how come they didnt care and just pushed a button to open the gate im giving it two stars just because its called fallout if you are going to make a series based on one of the most popular video games please take it seriously
i dont leave reviews for movies or tv shows ever but this one deserves all the praise as a huge fan of the fallout games i was not getting my hopes up too much in order to avoid disappointment this however does not disappoint i have had not had so much fun watching a show in such a long time they paid so much attention to detail that it felt like playing the games all over again the balance of humor horror action and historical elements make for such a unique experience not seen much in television the creators also made a very memorable story with some truly gutwrenching moments the actors crushed it too go watch this show now
"been a fan of the fallout games for  yearsi had nolow expectations going in but i was captured from the first episode the great characters the twisted dark fallout humor we all love the great cinematography it all works perfectlythis is what happens when you take what is best about an ip and then build upon that a perfect example of how to make something for the fans while not just making a straight up adaptationjonathan nolan worked on this and his love for the franchise and amazing skills with directing really showsone of the main writers for the show has worked on the office us amongst other things and i think thats why the humor is so perfect at least to meand the end shot lets goo
"
i just finished watching it from beginning to end i played the pc game fallout  but never finished it the series at the other hand was very compelling for me at least only problem i can find as far as i can see is first act introducing the world of fallout although great  is a little bit long and tedious and might be turn over for casual viewer fallout starts with a nostalgic jittery aura of an alternate future with ies aesthatics when bombs begin to fall but then after centuries later we are introduced with a very naive and insular isolated society of vault dwellers living their lived not interracting with any surviving human communities at all  or so ity seems from then the story and conspiracy involving it unfolds with flashbacks to pre nuclear war era step by stepthe writer jonathan nolans reluctance and deep suspicion of corporate culture and wild free for all capitalism is all plain to see in it  there was something similar in his previous tv series person of interest and even michael emerson from that show guest starring in one episode here in falloutella purnell as main heroine lucy  vault  dweller searching her father is quite a find for me and aaron muten as her co star maximus brother of steel squire holds own his own  the building romance has a macabre humour in it but as far as i concerned best performance was from walton goggins as ghoul the bounty hunter and his previous western actor character before the nuclear war  cooper howard goggins was great in his dual role especially as badass and snarky ghoul but i bet he had fun with pre war ies aestetics driving car or wearing fashion of that era
i am a gamer but i had no idea about the fallout game series and at first i had almost no expectations because adapted movies or tv series are usually bad thats how i started the series and then i fell in love with it it has almost all the features a postapocalyptic genre lover would want the series has very good actors and a realistic postapocalyptic world the story is pretty good but since this is a spoilerfree review i wont talk about it here ive read comments about the series like it doesnt have a dark enough world or story i can assure you that the character development tone and story of the series are very suitable for a postapocalyptic world the thing that made me most nervous before watching the first trailer of the series was that it presented a ridiculous postapocalyptic world like far cry new dawn but what i feared did not happen i recommend you to watch a series that deserves a lot of effort and deserves its due thank you for reading
i am not a video game person i have no prior knowledge of the video games this is based on i watched this because i heard there was a similarity between this and the last id us which i loved there is some similiarity in that there is a grim postapocalyptic setting and a quest but it has a very different tone i love the s frozen in time infused nature of this one walter goggins is always good and this is no exception the series is littered with commentary about the attempts to live in a utopian society and the failings of mankind it is part scifi part western part drama and more it is interesting visually terrific well scripted it is well directed it is very very watchable the acting is great there are many cameos and famous stars throughout i liked this a lot there is a lot of thought provoking social and political commentary throughout
no spoilers but references to common items and things seen in the traileras an avid fan enthusiast obsessor and collector of everything fallout since fallout  came out thank you random gamestop employees in  who suggested the game and series to me i had never heard of before i was so worried that this tv show would turn out and disastrous and god awful as the halo series but ive never been so pleasantly surprised to have my fears waylaid asidethe show is good fallout fans will be happy with this sure the trailers give away a lot and there are the usual formulaic story progressions and tropes but the show surprises you at times with minor twists and it has its chuckle momentsthere is plenty of gore and the main character lucys half curses gosh dam it are cute and enduring growing up in the vault we knew she was going to be naive upon leaving the vaults safety but she has a plausible background of training growing up that allows her to survive in the wasteland more than just by dumb lucki love all the nostalgia and lore built into this the familiar sites and references and things like yummyum deviled eggs and abraxo cleaner is thrown in perfectlythe only thing that could make the show better is the addition of death claws which im sure will make their appearance eventuallyi will mention just as a fact and as noted in the first few minutes of the series that it takes place  years later after the bombs fell on october rd  making the show take place in or around  which puts its story and time as the oldest in the entire series the closest of which being the events of fallout  in  albeit all the way across the country in the common wealth of boston since the airship shown in the trailer is the prydwen i believe its safe to assume the events of fallout  had the brotherhood of steel ending until proven otherwise sorry institute and bye bye sean
i played the fallout games but it is a long time ago i must admit fallout was a good game with hice stories and a nice world it has its own kind of humour i do not know the story so good because i like to skip the videos because i want to play the game instead of watching a movienow it is the other way around and i must say there are times i am feeling it is just like the game but there is also a moment that i have the same feeling why i dont like the game the useless filling if it is on purpose to get this feeling brilliantlets first start with the visuals very good everything looks like the gamethe story also nice but sometimes i could not totally follow it maybe i need to rewatch it but it is not a difficult story and there are plot twists and almost everything is solved by a miracle but i do like the choices everybody needs to make it is like making your choice in the game what is the right choicethe acting for me it is a high levelthe costumes they look really nice the brotherhood looks like power ranger botsi like the guns and the sounds the gore is there the sillyness but sometimes i think it is too easy if this was a game it was on story mode how can you survive that long let alone get through the frist night the monsters are looking fake but it fits totally they are weirdso there is nothing really negative but i feel like there should be more there is still room for improvement like i said there is no real danger in the world how can someone from the vault survive that long and i think season one needs  episodes or something just as long as the game takes pso for me it is a  but i cannot give it an 
i recognize so much in this  the faithfulness demonstrated here to recreate the fallout world is just astounding and much of it with practical effects thats not something you see often these daystheres the right blend of expected humor and seriousness with dollops of gore that are often presented humorouslythe music oh wow this above all brings back the memories of when i played the original fallout and being introduced to the music of the wonderful louis armstrong i want the ostthe acting is on point everyone seen so far including the background actors has been excellent ella was well chosen aaron moten has believability walton goggins just shreds each scene hes in and as for the other well known talenti went into this relatively blind and had no idea kyle maclachlan and michael emerson were in it sure emerson plays a stereotype role but boy does he do it wellis it perfect nah there will be parts that people will pick over for this fallout fan though this satisfied me deeply ignore the inevitable youtubers complaining about girl bosses theyve shown their true colorsi pray that cavills whk adaptation is at least this good
a mild mostly realistic but artificial representation of that postapocalyptic city with heavily interlaced s and ndrd century vibes devices equipment and way of lifeit feels incomplete could have been provided with heavier development as to cooper howards radioactive fate lucys father played mysteriously by kyle maclachlan and her mother as wellthese incomplete stands and plot holes hurt the series and are taintedly replaced with the ghouls charismatic psycho prowesses and pistol whipping also the character of michael emerson was hugely wasted equaling to the weight of his head mostly bad decision in my opinion to say the leastall that i said and unhappily complained about had just one purpose the milking of viewers for a second season and making them go berserkly mad at the long wait till fallout iiin retrospect please allow me to praise the mostly speedy development and production of this futurecult show that has the potential to become equal to or even surpass westworld quality if they add some more fusion reactions more engaging character development and blindingly bright orangewhite multimegaton atomic explosions in the series futurep s alphaemitted notes to some shows that take  years development filming and readiness per seasonscreenplaystorylineplots production valueimpact development realism entertainment acting filmingphotographycinematography vfx musicscoresound depth logic flow actionadventuredramascifi ending 
"all stars are for the effects props and costumes which are stellar discounting the face plate its so dumb
they ruined the most intriguing part of fallout lore the new california republicvaults in the middle of la known postwar as the boneyard wouldve been contacted by or even opened up to the ncrthe removal of mystery upon game endings and of who began the nucular exchange which if it was to be revealed should have been chinese submarines just off the coast of the us with the assistance of spys sabotaging early warning systems like the games actually suggest opposed to redditor theory craftingive never believed the conspiracy that bethesda hates fallout new vegas untill now it feels almost like theres malicious intend toward the west coast setting of the game if they wanted a wild setting with bos and enclave they couldve gone with just about anywhere except california but no they had to rewrite nv and old lore literally anywhere else wouldve been better for the story they told almost as if its just to piss us off"
to be totally honest my expectations for this was very mixed as its obviously a series based off of the video games which usually means its going to be really good or complete rubbish this was extremely good it feels high quality and most of the cgi is fairly decent story is interesting and definitely plenty of action  great series some episodes really do leave you desperate to know more its definitely worth the watch even if you have no knowledge of the games but id say it probably is slightly more enjoyable if you have played them as it references a lot of the ingame items and mutants
i played the first  fallout games on pc and ps which i enjoyed immensely ive been playing video games since pong was released before space invaders great and authentic adaption of the video game and the first scenes of the first episode are quite chilling to see the nuclear bombs go off around la  great storyline and atmospheric props background effects  the sound track is amazing and fantastic and totally fitting  the acting is exceptional considering the concept so very well done all over  its an outstanding series and deserved many awards  it is amazing how it encapsulates the entire fallout concept  if you dont enjoy this series you have no imagination
i like many of you have grown tired of the same tedious ideas repeated over and over of the trying to please everyone so you please no one boring entertainment of the last  or so years what happened to our stories what happened to our art no guts no glory my friends this show proves it it has soul it actually feels like the people that created the show understand the gaming franchise audience and arent just collecting a check it feels like they cared and put thought into this this is much more than a girl meets outside world type of show its multilayered in a way that isnt overdone or confusing the people seem like real and flawed individuals with different agendas and backstories that flesh out their character the lore is extensive looks amazing costumes great acting great especially from our leading lady and of course from the always amazing walton the themes are incredibly relevant and explored to perfection its not preaching to us its telling us a story its showing us how multifaceted both the individual and humanity is how people can be both good and bad and that dichotomy might night even exist at all this show gives me hope that there is really untapped talent out there still waiting to be uncovered writers directors producers that care i hope this serves as a wake up call to those who have been giving us the same nonsense for the last  years for real

i went into the show wanting to hate it after the disaster that was the halo show ive played the bethesda games and nv several times and love them and love the lore fallout and bethesda have had some issues lately and i was not thrilled to see that todd howard was on this project but they absolutely nailed this show the plot is great the writing is amazing for the most part every character is interesting theres just enough fan service to the people who played the games and my wife who has never played any of the games thought it was a little weird but she was hooked the whole way through
starring the likes of walton goggins kyle maclachlan dale dickey  erik estrada this tv show follows the lives of individuals surviving in a post nuclear war world a couple of hundred years after the bombs have hit los angeles  people have to live in the safety of underground vaults but when the father of one of them is kidnapped by wasteland raiders in an elaborate ambush then she has to leave the safety of her vault to go  rescue him only to discover he is the one responsible for the nuclear apocalypse in the first place whilst another character she meets finds out his beloved wife also played a part in planning it after this was recommended to me i didnt think i was going to like it as im not really a sci fi fan but it was better than i expected as i enjoyed the imaginative fantasy element to it which really bought the storyline of the characters alive  now im going to have to play the game to see how it compares ive seen better shows but like i said it was better than i expected so if post apocalyptic sci fi fantasy shows are your thing then you might want to give it a go
never played the games but im a huge fan of the old postapocalypse going all the way back to my s childhood spent watching the likes of the bbcs terrifying  version of day of the triffids and reading judge dredds cursed earth stories in ad this version of fallout has to be right up with them as one of the very best of the genre the characters are brilliantly written the acting is just fantastic accross the board the effects work very well and the story leaves us desperate for more dark and often laughoutloud humour bloody violence and anticapitalist cynicism abound intelligent without being worthy the show has just the right balance of ideas vs action the world building is unparalleled  to get quite so much into one series is a significant achievement one word of advice it does take a while to build the world and establish the characters watch through to the end of episode  if youre undecided after the first three
"i have to say it first i am a gamer i have never played fallout but as someone who can easily spend  hours in a game i am careful around series and movies based on video games because a lot can go wrong resident evil is a great example of how things can go wrong and the last of us is am example how things can go mostly right outside of bella one note ramsay that is
however i havent played fallout ever so i have no comparisons to the game i dont know what works for the game or against it on the show and honestly i dont even carethe fact is that from the pov of someone who lives an exciting mysterythrilleradventurescifi this series just doesnt do it for me the premise is just extremely weird like the society has not evolved since the red scare in the u s except some hitech cadgets come onthe acting is alright except aaron moten akan maximus cannot act to save his life he always looks like he is on something trying to keep his eyes open there would have been so many more deserving actor for that rolei am aware that when a series is hyped over the top people are not really allowed to say different opinions but for me this show just doesnt work as much as even some worse media based on video games even welcome to raccoon city does more for me than this and the guy who plays leon s kennedy is absolutely awful"
"let me get this out of the way by just saying wow the set design and attention to detail is amazing and they really outdone themselves now regarding the three main characters i think its paced fantastically for me the tone with being goofy and weird but then serious is a really good way to pace a show especially when thats fallouts aesthetic i dont believe there was a single episode except maybe the vault  plotline which really didnt need to happen now for the important part is it faithful to the source materialwell
quickfire about things that dont make sense compared to the games
shady sands is not located in the la
the boneyard does not have the  ncr citizens it boasted about in fallout 
the master antagonist of fallout  who tracked down vaults is never mentioned in this show at all his hq was in la and its never explained why vault  or vault  were not discovered by him
the brotherhood of steel becoming the most powerful faction in the region with seemingly no explanationthis one could be a mistake or actually tremendously bad for the canon in one of the episodes its explained that in  began the fall of shady sands then a arrow pointing to a nuclear explosion nv takes place in  so if shady sands was destroyed in  it de canonizes nv completely however its shown that their is a year below each of the events in shady sands timeline but not one under the explosion they could easily fix this mistake great show overall but it has a lot of lore problems regarding the ncr"
i am a long time fan of the franchise and i can thoroughly say that as the creators explained it wanting to keep it in the continuity of the series but create its own story it does it fabulously even the first episode as well crafted there were things from the lore that was pulled that fallout fans would know if you have played the games previously even ella purnell does a brilliant job of displaying the naïve innocence that is common in so many vault dwellers the fact that we finally got an origin story for dog meat that is both believable and convincing is great as well i will say there are things that caught my eye as being off but it was mostly cars that didnt look like corvegas doing all of them would have been way expensive or the fact that the ghoul makeup should have been a tiny bit more zombie esque even with events but im not nitpicking thats minor things
i have never played this game in my life but actually throughly enjoyed this show the aesthetic and easy to follow storyline allows it to be enjoyed by everyone some things were difficult to understand im guessing specific parts of the game but honestly i could grasp the basics and connect to the charactersella purnells acting is in another league i actually cried in the last episode purely because of her sad eyes if somebody who has no connection to the game wants to rewatch it i think its undoubtedly a show that all fans of the game should watch i thought it would be a sweeping interest to me but i been recommending it to all those around me
as a big fan of the game i was afraid that the adaptation to a show would be a disappointment full of political correctness but much to my surprise i really enjoyed the show and there is great recognition of settings and characters gadgets products stores etc depicted in the game is also depicted in the show and very nicelythere are some downsides the main ones are the character maximus the shallow depiction of the brotherhood of steele and the somewhat lengthy description of vaultech before the disaster maximus is extremely annoying both the character and the guy who plays him hopefully he will not be in season  which i hope will be madeotherwise regarding the cast the main character lucy works well but the ghoul played by goggins is great
when i first heard that the game was going to be adapted into liveaction i was disappointed in the news and dreading the result after watching this series i am so glad to say that i was wrong i cant complain at all really it would be nitpicking to do so i believe the show is so well done that it could be watched by anyone who has never played the game you can dive right in and get hooked on this amazing worldi love the way that the film gives you different perspectives of the world and doesnt follow just one persons point of view the lead character lucy is a great representation of a player who plays fallout for the first time due to how naive and innocent she is at the beginning and true to the game shes met with very hard decisions that evolve her character  out of  for me
if you have played the fallout games  which this is based on  it is actually pretty solid if not an excellent adoption it has a lot of intricacies mutants ghouls factions wacky dialogue a lot of if not all the aspect that made the game great in the first placethe main characters and their stories are surprisingly well done very entertainingseeing benjamin linus aka michael emerson on screen again  it had me almost jump out of the chair in euphoria he was a character in lost and there was something tremendously nostalgic having him appearthe game is about exploring the wasteland in an interesting setting going on an adventure dangers adoption to circumstances survival this show certainly felt like an adventure  with a well ironed out source material and screenwriting well done 
"i am noticing the degrading quality of current way of story telling and making films in this industry which employs a disgusting technique to conduct systematic attacks on a normal persons psycheone of the most subtle technique is to relax the audience first by showing a calm and safe scene or environmentthen out of nowehere attack their sense with extremely discomforting scenarios like animal abuse or extreme violence mistrust dropping a atomic bomb on a nice summer day family gathering other kind wanting to shock and attack the open mind tactics
and any type of relationship is reduced to animalistic sex nothing more empty meaningless there sole purpose is shock value not creating complex but deeper bonds just sex  love but it will turn into hate the next moment because people engaged never knew one another to begin withrelax the audience and shock them especially with unneccesaary violence mistrust and lack of true connectionthis show is no exception for employing such disgusting tactics to assault human sensibility and psyche our minds when open begin to trust and take in and ready to really open up to receive more information thats why they create scenes that build such trust of audience and then bombard them with abusive elementsif people are unaware of this they just absorb this as normal and even appreciate it while subconsciously they will be programmed to on a celluar level because body remembers to never truly trust and relax into the beneficial nature of reality and human naturethey just want the audience live in subtle mistrust and anxiety and most relationships they show on tv nowadays do not have redeeming long lasting deeper bond qualities it is often disconnected empty build mistrust and shock value orientedi noticed plenty of all that in this seriesnothing deep incredibly shallow and empty and unneccesarily violentit does not make the world any one bit betteri could not even finish first episode as i recognized what is so rampant in current trend of film making in this onei pass this as its energy is really yucky"
its mostly a really good show it adapted the source insanely well both in aestethic and feel anyone whos played the games will probably love this by default as its not just easter egg based references but actually manages to recreate the atmosphere nearly perfectlyvisually its a  adaptation the music is mostly from the games which is the best decision they could have made and most of the actors are great in their rolesso why not a  take away the nostalgia and the already existing world to build on and the plot itself is mid at best its on par with some of the ingame lore youll get from playing the games the action pieces are somewhat lacking at times imo and while the acting is good some of the characters are just  bland and uninteresting and spend an awful lot of time just staring at stuff in confusiongiven the stakes set up and the asumed danger around every corner of the wasteland the amont of time spend just standing around in confusion just does not fit and took me out of it many times througout the show especially maximus but other characters as wellits fine to get calm moments but the show got plenty as is and it just doesnt seem right that every character seems to need a moment of deep thought which is not interesting to look at from a cinematic perspective either if you do it  times each episode in order to decide basicly anythingi get what they tried doing but it just doesnt work imo
skeptical was i beginning this series oh yepso pleasantly surprised watching a bit what an understatement it blew me awaythis so exceeds cant use exceeded yet only to episode  my expectations it is unfathomably well done mhoits the best science fiction drama with a bit of subtle humor to a tv series in simply decades and the soundtrack has me reliving the s when i was a baby to nearly  years oldagain mho simply the best better than all the rest science fiction television wannabes if i can steal from tina turner it is simply again the bestwell done netflixyou caught me so off guard with this series
where do i start 🤔 if youre a fan of the game you will really enjoy it if you never heard of fallout and its your first time watching it you might enjoy it im a fan and i definitely enjoyed this show instead of focusing on one characters they gave you  stories and add a concept of big companies are willing to do to win like dropping a bomb on the worldloved the tropes of the fallout world from the weapons vaults pipboys ghouls fearl ghouls brother hood of steel just brings you back in time i can honestly say i definitely enjoyed watching this show i hope they get a season 
this is actually an incredibly good show with a good solid storyline that keeps viewers entertained and engaged now with that said i really kind of hate shows and movies with the whole retro future type thing it really kind of annoys my senses im pretty much all future futuristic all the time still what they did with this show is nice its enough gore to keep people satisfied with some what real world challengesif the world was post apocalypticpost war kind of a way the writers did an excellent job telling fallouts story and the actors played theyre parts brilliantly there was no cheeky over acting and the roles that some of the actors had were done pretty well they had dark comedy and enough guts and mayhem to have a good melody its not jump out of your seats action with huge expensive explosionthat i like too its just good cinema
i know some people have given this show super low reviews while i do understand some of their sentiments most are just someone who is upset it isnt exactly  perfectly fallout from every single fallout gamei thought this show captured the feel of fallout very well the scenery is fallout sure some things have been changed slightly but everything just feels like fallout from one of the various games or a few at the same time there are tons of easter eggs in the series too and im sure i missed a ton morethe lead character played the vault dweller perfectly i know its a woman but you can choose to be a woman in the game and yes she is unbelievably capable but that is explained in the first episode it almost seems as if shes leveled up while in the vault vs after leaving the vault at least thats the way i took itthe producers directors actors and everyone seems to have studied fallout its hard to make a game to tv adaption as well as this was done and i remember my fair share of tries over the years this was so well done and im absolutely impressed by how much they incorporated from the game so spot on even dogmeat is in the gamei cant decide who i like more lucy mclean or cooper howard both characters embody fallout so well i might need season  to help me decide
"i dont understand why people lie in these reviewsthere are multiple top rated reviews saying stuff like one of the best video game adaptations ever and then say stuff like i particularly liked the mutant bandit guy
though this one is probably a real person considering no bot would have list of best prn actresses which he regularly updatesor another guy who think nuclear bombs work same way in real life as in fallout and vault tec vaults were actually a good thing rather than twisted experimentstruth be told im sad reading these reviews as a guy who spent around  hours playing fallout games and around  hours reading and listening to fallout lore and stories on wiki and youtube respectfullywhy are most of you lying about playing the fallout games why not just say you liked the series and not mention anything about the game "
let me regale you with tales of the epic journey that is the fallout tv series step into the postapocalyptic world where every decision shapes your destiny from the radioactive ruins of vault  to the bustling streets of diamond city every frame oozes with the gritty charm of the fallout universebut what truly sets this series apart is the mesmerizing performance of walton goggins as the ghoul with his haunting gaze and impeccable delivery he breathes life into the iconic character capturing the essence of the wastelands enigmatic inhabitants whether hes striking fear into the hearts of raiders or forging unlikely alliances goggins commands the screen with an intensity that leaves you craving for morebut fear not fellow wasteland wanderers for the brilliance of the fallout tv series extends far beyond its stellar cast with its intricate storytelling jawdropping visuals and pulsepounding action sequences each episode is a testament to the unparalleled craftsmanship of the creatorsso grab your pipboy gear up and embark on an unforgettable adventure through the irradiated ruins of civilization the fallout tv series is an absolute triumph a mustwatch for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike prepare to be immersed like never before in the world of fallout where every choice matters and the journey is as treacherous as it is exhilarating
predictable script and pointlessly obscene violence alongside a heavily guardiansofthegalaxified musical fight scenewhen the main characters proposed husband steps into frame all pouty and slightly rough it was as if they werent at all trying to hide that something bad was going to happen then follows a ridiculous scene where horrendously violent acts such as the barrel of a gun being inserted into a mans mouth before the raider shooting at others through the hole in his head go alongside comic relief characters saying funny things while more slowmo fighting occurs in the backgroundfollowing the atmosphere of the games the soundtrack was always going to be a big part of this and i understand that the mix of violence and quirky humour was a big part of the games in a liveaction format i dont think this comes across in the same way and the scene ive mostly referred to seemed marvelised and when i see filmstv following trends it really takes me out of the moment and discourages me from watching further
following in the big boots of the last of us and twisted metal this continues the tradition of amazing adaptations that are easily digestible and fun for newcomers alike my wife especially knows nothing about any video games and i am a fan of them all so when we both love an adaptation i believe that is the sign of a perfect product my brother and i were able to geek out about all of the tiny references they manage to stuff into every scene and my wife was just interested in the story and new and exciting locations and imagery the show offers we especially love the cinematography the shots are so skillfully planned and executed thank you for another great and we cannot wait to find out where this show goes
brilliant series binged all  episodes and im still hungry for morei loved the characters the intrigue the storyline the sets the action the special effects the actors the script the twistsi loved the ending the beginning and everything that happened in the middlei loved the soundtrack the paradoxical music and the paradoxical societiesi loved the level of gore the humour found in it and the shock value when it was neededi loved the creatures the monsters and the back stories i loved how fleshed out everyones character wasi loved that  episodes flashed past even though it accounted for hours of my lifei loved the fight for survival even down to the small things like thirst hunger and betrayali loved the progression from innocence through to adulthoodi feel completely satisfied with season  and season  cannot come fast enough amazing television bravo im tempted to give my telly a standing ovationi now have two favourite game to tv adaptations this and the last of us
every episode is better than the previous i have never experienced a better interpretation of a video game ever this is show is flawlessif the festa could write a handbook on how they wrote this show i would demand that every other studio in the world could follow their notes on how to make it more perfect their project of course game of thrones invincible all of it it doesnt matter the show does it all i do hope that they eventually make a skyrim tv series i think that would be fantastic todd howard is an amazing executive producer and i hope that he makes more things in the future  out of 
im not a gamer and had never hears of fallout until this seriesi have to say i loved it the visual effects are amazing the acting is great the soundtrack is simply fantastic a great storyline with twists and turns the ghoul is brilliantly acted and portrayedive just heard series  is confirmed which a fab newsi very very rarely binge a series  boredom kicks in  but i did this in two days and was left still wanting moretheres the right balance of true grim darkness and dark humour without making a mockery of the series or diminishing the toneim not sure ill be racing to be a gamer but ive certainly enjoyed this series
its usually pretty hard to make a show or a movie based off a game but they did a really good job with this one i loved the fallout games so its cool see the things from the games come to life in this show i also like that they didnt just focus on the woman leaving the vault there are actually  main characters that you follow and learn more about the story is very engaging and the characters are interestingmy only issues with the show are that it can be a bit cheesy sometimes but thankfully not too much the lighting is not great either and reminds me of a teen show from the disney channel and the main actress reminds me of someone who came straight out of a disney show as welli also wish they made the ghoul look more ghoulish ive only seen a few episodes so far and im hoping to see more ghouls as the story progressesupdate i finished season one and i can honestly say it gets even better as the season goes on the cheesy situations go away after the third episode i also started out really disliking the ghoul but by the end of the series i really started to empathize with him
the main character is super annoying clearly as she is meant to be she is sheltered from the real world and its horrors living a fairytale until her life is uprootedas she ventures across the wasteland in search of her goal she learns what it takes to survive outside of the vaultthe details from the game are nicely crafted into a showthe gore is fairly graphic the show not shying away from its mother influencemy only complaints would be on the graphics which are painfully average at certain scenesi would highly recommend the watch if you are a fan of gore drama exhilirating fights and monsters
"first off i have played the games newvegas being my favoritei like the the very start when the bombs dropped but im having problems with the rest
goggins as the ghoul is 🔥 lucy is oki hate everything with the brotherhood the whole operation isnt lore accurate and the whole storyline could and should be eliminated from the show make them an outlying force with very limited interaction whats been written here is junkthe pacing is garbage and some editorial choices are bafflingi basically liked the wasteland roadtrip vibe and the vault storythe show looks great the soundtrack is great though a tad overusedoverall tolerable i wont rewatch and i wont beg for season  i might watch season  but i can take it or leave it"
as a veteran of fallout  and  i was very pleasantly surprised by this adaptation upon first viewing my initial impression was a very solid six but at the time of writing this review that has grown to an eight an intelligently set and presented main story which is also elegantly and wittily served sharp criticism of run amok capitalism and profitmotivated existence typical fallout toilet humor perfect background music striking postapocalyptic locations great cast  although not completely without flaws occasional banality and cheapness this is certainly one of the best screen adaptations of a video game
how it has taken this long for an excellent game adaptation is mind boggling fallout smashed it out of the park really captures the ruthlessness of the wastelands juxtaposed with the naivety of the vault inhabitants walton goggins as the ghoul is such a stellar casting and he delivers every second hes on frame fallout was ripe for the picking but after so many failures see halo witcher every resident evil etc etc this is a massive breathe of fresh air and i hope it paves the way for more high quality adaptations in the future well done amazon mgm and all the cast and crew on a brilliant first season
having enjoyed fallout   new vegas and  i was curious about this show but not hopeful there are so many ways they could have messed it up instead its almost perfect the people who worked on it have clearly played the game and know what makes it fun the details are spot on from the peeling paint in ruined houses to the leather armor of the raiders from the fifties crooner music to what a player actually says while fighting a yao guaithey also made the right choice in not trying to adapt a story from the game but making a new story in the world of the game and the characters are a lot better i shouldnt be surprised that professional actors can bring a character to life better than game coders  and yet some adaptations fail at thisthe show is great in ways that are easy to take for granted they didnt have to make it with the offbeat humor of repo man the casual brutality of the boys or the eyepopping scruffiness of terry gilliam but they did from dialogue to set design the little things are full of creativitymy only complaint is that the plot feels forced less what would really happen and more what has to happen to get the story where they already decided its going and i would have liked to see more random wasteland encounters and less politics because thats how i play the gamethis is the best video game adaptation so far and will probably remain the best video game adaptation for a long time to come im excited about what they might do with a higher budget in season 
i cried seriously tears of joy my husband calls me the ice queen cause i never cry well once but thats another story literally game of thrones like  in years ago but back to my fallout obsession omg love this show im a huge fallout geek like  achievement completion in all games on all platforms ive played well over  hours for each game i have  scale fallout weapons displayed on my wall framing my in tv and i have a fallout shrine so believe me when i say this is completely fun and a great show some props could be a little better quality power armor looks a little floppy or cheaply made in certain scenes but it is well worth the great  hour experience binged it all i cant wait to see season  in new vegas yaaaas the truth is the game was rigged from the start because hey in new vegas you never know thank you jonathan nolan
hats off bouquet of flowers rounds of applause and everything else to the creators of fallout thank you for bringing one of my favorite video game series to life you all created the perfect iteration of fallout and we love you for it the amount of detail included from the gamew was ao appreciated excellent multiple story lines and writing gorgeous cinematography home run acting from everyone involved and the feeling the entire  episodes that the showrunners knew what they were doing and delivered it ten fold ella purnell was incredible as lucy and portrayed the comedic naivety strength and relatability for people who do not know of fallout aaron moten as maximus was great and walton goggins as cooperthe ghoul is a remider that he is one of the best actors on the planet thank you so much and cannot wait for season  and beyond 👏
i binge watched the series in  days and had an absolute blastthe humor the games have is here the characters are on spot the world is well built and the series are perfectly true to its original sourceone striking thing for me in games was the music choice i was really satisfied that the series also used the same themespeople that did not played any of the games might find themselves a bit lost because although the references are explained they are done in a fast mode regardless i believe it is a must watch series for everyone and might make the fans returning them once again
i really enjoyed the games but i regret that ive seen this showthe thing thats really good about this is the accuracy of the environment and the props its really well made and the music and mood but seriously the script is as it was written by a teenager its incredibly stupid the plot makes no sense the characters are really uninteresting and doesnt make any sensethe t suite is cringy the way the wearers speech becomes slowed down is just embarrassingit feels like they had an entire world  the world of fallaout  to get ideas from and they had all this money to create the setting why cant they spend some money on some descent script im truly disappointed
the series was captivating from the outset growing increasingly compelling up to the thrilling conclusion of the first season its incredibly addictiveive heard numerous people mention bingewatching it in just one or two days because they couldnt pull themselves away as a veteran of the games i found that the series faithfully caters to longtime fans while also excelling as a highquality tv show in its own right the balance is struck beautifully and im eagerly anticipating the next seasonthe characters are both flawed and fascinating feeling instantly familiar to those of us familiar with the games i wholeheartedly recommend this showits important to remember that this series is intended for fans of all the fallout games not just those who prefer new vegas every fan has their favorite and the series doesnt favor just onethe acting is outstanding the casting is spoton and the effects are decent though i expect they will be even better in season  which is thankfully already confirmedthe storyline aligns well with the narratives typical of the games i have mixed feelings about the inclusion of nudity it seemed unnecessary and out of place as if added just for the sake of inclusion in one episodethis season is rich with fallout lore hinting at the depth still to explore in future seasons with so much lore available its clear that it would take several seasons to even scratch the surfacehaving watched all eight episodes my only grievance is wishing there were at least a couple more in this season those new to fallout might find some aspects baffling but thats to be expected im patiently waiting for season 
i was fired from my job and it was worth it just kidding lol but seriously this show is amazing wow i was almost feeling like i was in the game when i was watching the tv show i was like nope dont do that or this is going to happen i told you so you didnt listen to me lol like the tv screen can hear me and she was going to heed my advice and change the outcome what good show and i binged the whole season and could not stop this show was so good that i was on steam gaming today looking at buying all the games and playing them again like i did on console that i no longer have be warned because this tv show is very dark it shows a side of humanity that no one wants to see and that we hope will never come to pass
never played the game loved the series second time a round going lost is allso my favourite someone from there is always a major plus cant wait for second season lots of things happening really saw my self as an naive vault person hopefully will be a hit like the last of us personally prefer fallout better if would have to choose casting done well yellowjackets another one of my favourites really happy that prime had a huge hit in their hands guessing and understood this is a major hit dont seem like they spended billions on production and marketing like the last of us so have to think that as well
well folks i firstly have to say that this is an amazing st season it is  episodes that all feel worthy the cast are great the story is good the fallout injections of lore are fabulous and there are some funny elements to this that if youve played the game should put a smile on your faceif you havent played the game is this still a worthy watch yes i think this could potentially be a good primer with a caveat that ill talk about laterthe gore feels very appropriate the game itself has always involved that kind of gross detail it was a stark reality to match the stark wasteland the bloody mess perk springs to mindthere are some fun little easter eggs in this st season that somewhat hark back to the nature of the game if you are eagle eyed youll spot themthere were some issues that dug in my ribs but they arent so much a critique of the entertainment i received but more a direction that bethesda have for many people they didnt play fallout  and  where a lot of the original lore for this huge universe is derivedthe new california republic is a hotbutton for fallout fans and i believe that how they were covered in this season is problematic to a degree moldaver doesnt make sense we are to believe that she is a ghoul she doesnt look like one this is a perversion of how ghoul mechanics work and sticks in your side she didnt emerge from a cryo pod so she is an anomaly that i dont like if she was true to form she would have been president instead of tandi what this smacks of is bethesda and todds somewhat petty grievance with the obsidian black isle and interplay fallout of the past and this gave them the opportunity to solve a thorn in their side by rewriting historywhat i did like is the handling of vaulttec i loved all of the vaults vault   and  all make sense as does vault  chefs kissi always liked the enclave so i am happy that somehow they have returned but many fans will have a problem with this because they were wiped out in no uncertain terms im also disappointed we didnt see any super mutants or deathclaws the only hint of deathclaws is right at the end of the final episode of season  where the former overseer in his power armour puts his foot right by a deathclaw skull as he is making his way to new vegasthe brotherhood is somewhat questionable it doesnt ring quite true the west coast brotherhood should be quite different to the east coast but it can be explained awaythe caveat i mentioned further up is this a good primer well it depends i think that some things have been changed to stretch to fit in some degrees there has been some artistic licence that doesnt quite hit right there has also been some historical rewriting that im less than happy about which will confuse or pit new fallout fans against existing onesthat said i think they did a great job and im down for a second season new vegas should be funcould we get ron perlman back to say the line just say the line ron please
rating as a longtime fan of the fallout video game series i approached the fallout tv show with a mix of excitement and trepidation would it live up to the rich postapocalyptic world that had been so carefully crafted over the years im thrilled to report that not only did the show meet my expectationsit exceeded themthe creators of the fallout tv show have done something remarkable theyve captured the essence of the original games with such fidelity that it feels like stepping into the screen the attention to detail in the lore is meticulous preserving the series history and expanding upon it in ways that feel both fresh and familiarone of the most striking aspects of the show is how it encapsulates the s aesthetica core element of the games identity the eras influence is woven throughout the narrative not just as a visual motif but as a thematic undercurrent that echoes the games commentary on american culture the shows title vise versa cleverly hints at the intertwining of past and future a theme that resonates deeply with fans like myselfin conclusion this show really does prove that it can show potential to the original amazing show and im eager for more
cant help but fanboy out at this show the prewar and vault set pieces are straight out of the games with that retrofuturistic blend of awesome that makes this universe so compelling the show has solid attention to detail in so many awesome ways also i like the die hard nod with lucy mcleans name coupled with her badasseryseeing the training camp for the brotherhood of steel and the realistic way their culture is put to film is awesome im one episode in and hooked cant wait to see where this show goes ill throw in more as i binge the hell out of it based off of epsidode  though sits at a  for shows
the best thing about this show is that theyve managed to capture the feeling of booting up a new fallout game the world has such a unique feeling and tone  upbeat yet dark nostalgic yet futuristic comedic yet strangely mournful  and boy have they delivered with this doubly so when a sizable portion of the audience was preprepared to hate it and have clearly flipped upon viewinghonestly if you enjoy fallout as a game and even if you dont then its worth watching at least the first episode the plot is pretty simplistic but thats fine when the world and the characters are both done so well
no spoilers just raving reviewi think a lot of people didnt have very high expectations for this show and im seeing now that they are eating their wordseverything about this show is  entertainment the scenery is stunning the characters are complex and likable and the story is just so interesting they did an excellent job of keeping true to the game i will watch over and overi am extremely impressed with the production value as well it is clear that they have done their research and made this show with the fans of the games in mind hopefully we will see many more seasons to come
i have not played the games did not even know what this was abouti have to say however that i am generally a fan of scifi futuristic and dystopian storiesthis series totally surprised me with how well it is constructed from story and direction to music and acting i found some elements in its direction particularly original and i have watched a lot of series and movieswalton goggins totally nails it as well as ella purnell who is both stunning and talented i had already noticed her in yellowjackets but this is a much bigger role and we see her clearly refinednot much more to say if you are fan of dystopian sceneries and do not mind a little bit of splatter then this is a must watch
its exactly what i wanted a game to look like on the screen its fun its not for kids so im glad i didnt just watch it with the family its very adult content which is to be expectedthis show is what a fallout world would look like its harsh with all the environments like the wasteland philly and every other part of fallout universe its grimy and thats what i was looking for that being said it also is quirky and goofy in some aspects as is the actual games so it all makes sensei would recommend this for anyone who loves the games but im sure they have already watched it for everyone else its a darkly fun scifi romp around a wastelands im glad we got to see before the war
this series is breaking bad levels of awesome it has some nice nods to the games excellent humour great use of bullet time that doesnt become an overused gimmick and a phenomenal plot that twists and turns and fits in really well with the gamesthe sound cgi costumes set design and music are all impeccable and really bring the fallout world from the games to life it was so much better than i expected it to bethe storyline is unpredictable quirky and funny and builds to an epic finalei cannot wait for season  and will definitely watch this through a second time really highly recommended
the first season of the fallout tv series beautifully leverages the rich universe of the games offering a captivating narrative that surpasses the main quests of bethesdas original games without doubt with meticulous attention to detail the sets immerse viewers in a postapocalyptic world without relying too heavily on cgi the infusion of welltimed humor adds depth to the story making it not just a faithful adaptation but also a highly enjoyable experience in essence it sets a new standard for video game adaptations proving that the transition from console to screen can be a resounding success
all i can say is wow what a great adaptation of the fallout world with the fallout games particularly fallout new vegas being my favourite game of all time when news broke of the show being released i was excited but nervousbut let me clear this upthis was wonderful to watch from a fan i applaud the team behind the show and welcome season  with open arms everything from the sounds the pip boy makes to the stimpak sounds to the heavy footed sounds of the bos it just got better and better walter goggins in it was excellent too truly a masterpiece and i feel proud that a game i love now has an excellent show to accompany it
"the main reason is because basing a scifi drama on a weak plotted video game is just really dumb and egotistically disrespectful of entire generations of people who do not nor would they ever play or enjoy mindless video games trying to transfer the plotless nothingness of video games into an involved tv drama is a real oxymoron and ultimately doomed to failwe humans love the theater movies and tv because we love the human melodrama this gorefest gave us none of thatanother reason fallout scores low is the lack of compelling characters for the viewer to care about while all the characters were somewhat interesting in their own way with a special kudos to goggins multifaceted ghoul arias overthinking depressed brother norm and dickeys hardened ma june store proprietor nevertheless over this eightepisode slog and all the neverending mayhem  the lack of real story and some really poor dialogue you want to have sex what use my cock shaking my head and rolling my eyes
it just put the characters in spinning circles and brief cameos we viewers had little to no empathy with any of them besides that what with the endless wholesale slaughter we knew that they would be dead soon anywaysi feel that although the production crew and special effects people really went above and beyond with the postapocalyptic sets cgv desert scenes costumes and makeup to successfully create their dystopian world still all this effort and skill cant make up for what lacks in a coherent script and cohesive direction i got the distinct impression that this was a for gen z and millennials only tv program and i felt truly excluded this is not the spirit of good scifi ask h g wells and other imaginative writers well told scifi stories should be enjoyable by all age groups this elaborate video game was not stars out of "
such a perfect well made show im in the of watching it for the second time and it still feels like im watching it for the first time as im finding new things that i never caught the first time round im looking forward to season  and hopefully a  and  tbh they nailed the fallout world vibes it makes me want to jump back into the games theres never a boring scene either every episode keeps me invested im a fan of fallout but ive only ever played fallout  so theres bits of the lore that i dont know about but this show makes me want to go back and play the older games and learn about everything and just fall in love with the universe even more
fallout  season  is bombastic series that does justice to the original source as a fan of some of the bethesda games i have to say it bring the bethesda storytelling magic into this series where one could question the ethical dilemma with their final action and doesnt shy away from a tragic and convincing backgroundella purnell does a great job portraying the main character as a naive person who doesnt know real world and i have to say walton goggins playing the ghoul is the main course of this fine dining seriesi love that this series brings the irony approach to the story and directing where we could see a contrast reality between two world and one could questions the theme of post apocalypse just as the first episode talking about the end and ends with the beginning absolutely love the show very recommended
ive played all the fallout videogames from start to finish since fallout  was released in the s and i can honestly say this faithfully captures the essence of the franchise this series is not just entertaining its thought provoking to be honest i was shocked at how good it was i was half expecting a rings of power or wheel of time type debacle but instead we may have the best videogame to tv  film adaptation everthe writing is excellent and the way the main three protagonists evolve given the revelations regarding their backstory is greati think the complainers will say things like diversity this and inclusion that in the casting but forget that focus on the story for once and you will thoroughly enjoy it
and there we go exactly what i and many others have been saying for years when doing a show or movie or whatever on an already existing ip you should not be doing your own thing you should do the ip you just acquired may sound simple but oh man how many times in recent memory have we seen fantastic ips completely butchered by showrunners doing their own thingthe fallout series does exactly what a show like this should do as a hardcore fan since fo i can happily say that the fallout show delivers some eyewatering moments of the true fallout experience excessive violence bleak futuristic sceneries blended with easy humor sceneries costumes and characters looks fantastic the story is pretty good it goes a hilariously iptypical route that we´ve already been down on but that doesn´t bother me its all very well done and the final is just soo good the cast does a fantastic job all the way and as a fallout fan i don´t think i could ask for more than this i really look forward to the next season
really enjoyed this  it actually starts a little slow  they take a while to let the story develop and to let the characters grow  but about  episodes in it really comes together thoroughly enjoyed it and clearly theres more to come and thats about the jest of it without saying too much but there are a few plot twists in there  and im looking forward to the next season only wish this one was a few episodes longer really enjoyed this  it actually starts a little slow  they take a while to let the story develop and to let the characters grow  but about  episodes in it really comes together thoroughly enjoyed it and clearly theres more to come and thats about the jest of it without saying too much but there are a few plot twists in there  and im looking forward to the next season only wish this one was a few episodes longer

there hasnt been a good tv show in decades this is what im talking about real film production right here breathtaking great attacking phenomenal nowadays the premise of a show will have so much hope but the actors are terrible vise versa this is a masterpiece and maybe our standards are too low these days bring back good shows what a great step in the right direction cant wait for season  lets just hope it doesnt take too long due to the current mental focus span we have these days i am only on episode  but seriously blown away by how its so good already and finally something for me to watch and actually enjoy
i just finished all episodes oh man it left me craving for more fallout is definately a great fan service with spoton visuals lore and easter eggs it does a good job of presenting the world and characters after which the story really kicks in i would argue that people who give bad reviews becaue of the plot have only watched first few episodes those episodes are for world building but its also good tv in generalfallout has very seemless mix of violence action humor and drama story telling goes in two timelines which often breaks the pace of many other shows but not in fallout you can feel that the showrunners care for their product there is a feeling they have already planned plotarch over several seasons pacing is excellent for compared to any other show action is only used when it serves the plot there arent forced action scenes just for the sake of it characters are given the time to mature theres plenty of shades in main ones as they change during the season lucy is a spoton protagonist she brings humor and humane touch to the show but shes also decisive smart and vulnerable great character and ella purnell delivers the ghoul obviously is cool as a cucumber but he also has depthplot is interesting and story is told in an interesting and gripping way mysteries are solved piece by piece its also refreshing that nothing is spoon fed and theres no forced political message viewers can figure stuff out themselves it does a rare job of presenting the world and characters in an interesting way you really care what happens to them for those who are unfamiliar with the franchise the pacing is just right to understand whats this all about for the fans its constant eye and ear candy
i love how it takes place in the fallout universe thats already established yet offers something fresh at every turn every prop battle conversation feels right out of the games even the special system is referenced theres many easter eggs for those that have played the games the plot is solid and twisted and you really atart to care about the characters and you dont have to know anything about the universe to understand and enjoy the show though it does make it more enjoyable you can tell this show was made by fans my only issue is is the sex and nudity the games dont have any nudity but does have some sexual jokes i really wanted to enjoy this show with my son who plays the games
this series is a phenomenal adaptation of the games i wanted to atleast make this series last me a week or two but it was too good not to binge if you love the fallout games like me you will love this series it has made me want to dive back into the gamesi honestly had low expectations coming in given there are not a lot of great video game adaptations to live action but this blew my mind with how good it was honestly i do not have a bad word to say about it the acting performances were great the story and writing were great the sets and costumes were great and the call backs to the video games were great i feel like this show actually deserves awards
this adaptation for me tows the line well between staying true to its orgins and creating something newstylistically it definitely leans more towards fallout  and  but in terms of the plot lore and established locations factions and various creatures brands and companies it takes from all the fallout gamesin terms of dialogue plot and characters the writing is decent with a great mixture of humour and darkness but its definitely aided by already established lore and a world crafted by nearly  decades of games the greatest asset of the show though is walton goggins absolute masterclass portrayal of movie starturnedghoul cooper howard goggins like in every role he plays immerses himself in the character whilst bringing his unique voice cadence humour and expressiveness to his characteroverall this show is a wonderful adaptation with enough to draw in people unfamiliar with the video game series but importantly also enough for the majority of fans of the games to really buy into it im excited to see what the second season brings
i really enjoyed this adaptation of fallout its relatable dark humorous and entertaining i was hooked just after one episode the story line is very well thought out and full of twists and turns this post apocalyptic world is so different and interesting it keeps you coming back for more the final episode of the first season has you reeling for the next one in my opinion it will absolutely requires a second season and maybe even a third since the  vaults are interlinked and so are so many characters stories i can not wait to see if they continue this series as i see its potential
as a dabbler in the fallout games having only played fallout  in its entirety and then some yet experiencing the likes of fallout  and new vegas briefly i went into this one with low expectations and tickle me pink as i found myself not only liking it but finding it to be pretty great overall from the acting to the setting and even the old school music soundtrack which is a staple of the fallout series is spot on thru and thru the plot is evenly paced focusing on  main characters along with various subcharacters and even with all of the time jumping it does from the past to present i felt like it was so tightly wounded that when all the main characters converge in the finale there was such a satisfying payoff what begins as a simple rescue mission ends in a culmination of various revelations that change the characters worlds as they know it i was also fearing that the show would suffer the plague known as the girl boss where insert mary sue here whos immediately overpowered and invincible isnt faced with many challenges or hurdles to overcome and rest assured dear viewer that isnt the case here when it comes to lucy the vault dweller shes naive and vulnerable at the start but the character development on her is very well fleshed out and she becomes quite the sturdy gal by the season finale this can be said about most of the main characters too walton goggins is especially delightful yet tragic to watch as the ghoul lastly i appreciated all of cool references to the game series such as the weapons to radiation equipment like rads items and even the vault tec gear like the pip boy they also nailed the look and feel of not only most of the games setting but the brotherhood of steel power suit and mannerisms as well i look forward to season two especially after that great tease in the finales credits to where theyre headed next
i gave this show a chance after i saw multiple videos popping up on youtube channels i watch occasionally claiming that the show was actually good i didnt really watch through those videos as i didnt want to have the story spoiled and go in as unbiased as possible my last fallout game was fallout  which was way over  years ago so i have some experience with the source material but its not recenti watched through the first episode and was mildly entertained the brutality and gore somewhat reflects what you see in the games as well with heads and limbs exploding or being severely injured theres also several slow motion scenes similar to what the games do when you do the autoaim functionality and target specific body partsthe world also looks like fallout as far as i can tell you have the postapocalyptic wastelands with shabby settlements trying to survive you have the raiders brotherhood of steel and vaults the outfits and backgrounds are accuratethe problems start when you look at the writing and characters though a whole lot of it doesnt really make any sense and it only works if you as the viewer as well as the characters arent actually asking very relevant questions as soon as your mind starts working though and questions pop up about certain aspects the story completely falls apart there are multiple factions and there are conflicts among them why these conflicts exist though  youll get a shrug from me because i couldnt figure it out  especially in the last episode when the big showdown starts the problem is also that way to many character in that one faction just go along with killing random people even though they are supposed to be kind of honorable and so on it just doesnt make any sensethe season also has an open end leaving a lot of questions on the table for season  on one hand it can be good to have an overarching storyline throughout the seasons on the other hand the ending of season  on its own is unsatisfying so you either watch season  or youre left with a mess and that just doesnt deserve a high rating in my opinionfinally something that also bothered me is that the pacing of the episodes was wildly jumping around at times it slows to a snail pace with obvious filler content and then at other times it jumps around all over the place and a rapid pace especially in the last episode there was one character suddenly popping up in the middle of the battle zone and i was like wait how did you get there unnoticed it just feels off in many aspects resulting in sometimes being boring and then at others slightly overwhelmed with the events happening there definitely is a lack of consistency here
 cant wait for season two season one exceeded my expectations and unlike many new interpretations of deep folk lore this delivered and painted an excellent picture to be enjoyed the characters were well thought out and fit their respective roles incredibly many details that all would see but deep fans would notice and incredibly enjoy the season came together beautifully and set the tone and pace smoothly as someone who is a deep fan and wasnt entirely sure how this would come together i am entirely pleased and look forward to the next season i just hope they dont make us wait too long after that cliffhanger thank you
as the title says i cant wait for season two ive never played the games but this show is really making me want to now i loveee the characters they have the perfect amount for flaws and redeeming qualities to actually make them realistic and likeable lucys naivety had me worried especially on the bridge scene where maximus his shot by one of the cannibals in the last few episodes there is a bunch of flashbacks to the ghoul cooper howards past with his wife being the one to actually suggest nuclear fallout  and with him presumably getting blacklisted from hollywood after bugging barbs pipboyalthough barb being the one to suggest the bombing suggests that she is pretty high up in vaulttech so why would she let the nukes drop when cooper and janey were at the party not safe waiting in a bunker even if she had divorced cooper wouldnt she want to keep track of janey
"phewfor the diehard game fans it is very close to the iterations  to  plus all the mechs factions apocalypse now very strong cast
if you binge it like i didhave lotsa tea breaks
goggins playing his usual character very sympathetic portrayal and gruesome scenes not for the faintheartedshades of westerworld ghouls etcwhen i first played the gamei played as a female character which was more interesting  the bethesda launch was somewhat clunky graphics wise but this then birthed the modding community of the time
skyrim wouldnt have beem modded as well if it wasnt for fallout as they shared the same coding
its funny very dark violent as another reviewer has stated but stick
with it if you have the stomach for it"
i have been playing fallout since its inception i recently started gaming on a gaming laptop now so ive been porting games i had on my xbox and playstation platforms to it  and fallout  and  are the most recent things i installed im almost finished with a replay of fallout  on it and so this show couldnt have come at a better timethey got so many things just right its not over the top but it is not at all subtle the look the feel the atmosphere even the music everything they did they nailed it im simply amazed at all the tiny little details that are here that often arent even in your field of view  you simply catch a glimpse of something out of the corner of your eye and you pause rewind a bit and check it out and yes it was what you thought it was even those tiny little things they managed to get in herei get it many people whining because it didnt follow the games and such for me thats a bonus thats what i would want otherwise im simply seeing something ive already played through countless times and know like the back of my handno this is fresh but it follows the natural flow of what i would expect in this post apocalyptic world it is the world ive come to love over years and years of gaming through totally new eyes that caught everythingactors seem to be doing just fine so far and they are introducing them and letting the viewer get to know them in bits and pieces as the story growsnormally with an adaptation like this i can find something that bugs me ive been bug free so far this is simply a purely enjoyable ride with amazing humor i dont know how many times ive laughed out loud at something that was just so unexpected but was exactly what youd expect from the world if you follow that twisted phrasing its dark it has plenty of unexpected moments and it is absolutely  enjoyable everyone involved should be very proud of the product theyve made
fallout the tv show is a terrific adaptation of the the fallout game world and story it introduces an entirely new storyline like most of the games did and it stays true to the style of the original games after the utter disappointment of halo and the mediocre stock of the last of us this show is a real delight gory well paced and well written with the right amount of humour ella purnell and walton goggins really shine in their portrayals of the vault dweller and the ghoul respectively i cannot recommend this show enough to both the fallout fans and newcomers alike  for me well done
ive waited years for this as a huge fallout fan and they certainly didnt disappoint there was only one spot where i was thinking it had wishy washy cgi and im sure everyone will agree that otherwise its fantastic the story was strong and engaging the characters were super entertaining and had depth if youre a fallout fan there is tons to look at and be reminded of the games you grew up on and love i honestly dont know how i can do anything other than praise them for making a show that added to the world instead of doing it damage i look forward to seeing what they come up with next kudos to everyone who worked on this the actors were incredible
based on ep im a fallout fan so that probably make me biased although the harshest critics so far seem to be fallout fansthe quality and attention to detail is astounding it feels like the game has come alive but does not feel fake it balances scifi humour horror violence and social commentary with easethe first episode was slower than i was expecting but this showed a confidence in storytelling and world building happy to keep watching and see where the story goeslots of little details for fans of the game the blink or youll miss appearance of a junk gun being a great example i had to pause and yes theyd faithful replicated that odd weapon
i dont play video games so the trailer had me expecting an dystopian thriller with a satirical edge perhaps along the lines of robocop and the sheer number of  reviews right here calling it phenomenal clever mindblowing etc sure had me stokedi was not expecting slapstickbe warned fallout is the dumb  dumber of apocalyptic series in fact thats far too kind fallout is the dumb  dumber to of apocalyptic series it is all gags relentlessly and about  in  landthe characters use bottlecaps for currency love jello cake enjoy having their codpieces polished and sometimes have greatuncles who are amphibiansclever rememberthe attempts at satire are so nonstop the jokes so neverending that it makes rick  morty feels like a drama im not being hyperbolic episode  of fallout starts out like a thriller with layers of dark comedy but thriller and dark are dropped entirely by episode two its just zany goofy lowstakes gore and potty humor after thatyou had your finger hacked off asks a crazed robotdoctor there ive given you a brand new finger now im going to harvest your organs that scene actually happensi do enjoy idiotic tv as much as the next guy i just prefer to know what im buying into ahead of time this show is complete idiocy by design and thats fine my review is only to warn you that this is nothing in the vein of say the last of us or silo there is no drama there is no darkness and there are no thrills to be hadjust jokes one after the other infinitelyon the technical side a major fight between an iron man and a zombie gunslinger in episode two is filmed with the skill of godzilla vs megalon by the lesser of the nolan brothers apparently if they were aiming for monty python i guess they nailed itso  stars since this is probably intended for people who laugh at farts and theyre obviously thrilled about it
they must have had a blast making this series can you imagine after years of designing the games you get to see it all come to life to walk through the sets and see all the details as an artist myself i would have loved to have been a part of this so awesomebig fan can you tell have played the games multiple times and i am beyond thrilled with this series and walter goggins come on so greatjust thinking on all the games and all the locations this series could go on and on and never get old each season could be a new location and new storylineive been so disappointed in most of the game adaptations but not this time
the fallout tv series brings the popular video game to life with a thrilling and truetogame world the show features detailed settings of the game interesting new characters story and plenty of action it mixes tough choices with humor just like the game fans of fallout games and new viewers will find a lot to enjoy and hopefully looking forward to a potential second seasonanyway very recommend to watchim pretty sure after watching you will want to fallout games againand hope the bethesda softworks will develop next generation game even with more extended features more advanced graphics and gameplay
some time ago ive played fallout  a lot and i have to say that this tv series is really well put together they picked the right cast the acting is top notch the scenery is made like its so real and makes me feel that im truly there yes im also fantasizing about it is that wrong what about the timing for this to come out in these serious world threats makes it even more real the story is good but its not something we havent seen before dont get me wrong im not a fanboy even my uncle who never played a fallout game strongly likes this series so gamer or no gamer this is made for everyone who likes this genre so far these episodes are really enjoyable and i hope they will continue to be like this or even surpass this level of entertainment if there is a gamer out there who played a fallout game and who complains about this tv series that gamer is just plain nuts
i really loved the work they have put in the script quality of costumes and cgi are top notch when you consider it is especially a tv seriesthey are mostly loyal to the seriesmy critiques are in the video game series china really attacked the us not the companies that bombed themselves in order to win massive money but this turn is also interesting that is quite finebrother of steels power armour like t would not get destroyed so easilythough the ghoul character looks interesting as a sharp shooter and cowboy he would have no chance against power armour so that was a bit cheese and ghouls are not bulletproof after alli do not understand why the main character and the guy from bos brother of steel do not loot at all they would eventually die without any guns considering how hazardous and dangerous the environment was in the gamesncr ranger helmets are only used by rangers not farmers and they were not used by public but by elite soldiers indeed i did not like that nerfreduction of the reputation of those guys but probably from the ending we will be seeing a fallout new vegas type road for the script i believeexpected super mutants to happen in shelter  but i guess because of the budget they had to use the monstercreature from the seawhen shelter company and other companies were discussing the possibilities when they dropped a nuke and the life afterwards like imagine the super mutants it was a comical joke since the life was good before nukes and they would not expect people to become super mutants due to radiation so it is not consistentexpected enclave to interfere to be honest the scientist who had escaped so flawlessly but they did not act somehow in the series enclave and bos are enemies and they did fight each otherpeople were so clean but in the game considering how restrictive to reach to clean water people were in dirt mostlymost people were savages due to the difficulty the effects of the atomic bomb broughtthere were chickens and cows which should have mutatedalso lots of greenery but we all know that it should have been mostly dried out trees or desert it was also a bit odd to see them in fallout  because it almost is basically impossible after the nukei think those are the only flaws the rest were amazing indeed they really nailed it amazing acting and cgi costumes and environment indeed
unlike most of the reviewers i never played any of the fallout games im aware of them and know the basic premise but have no deep understanding of the lore i feel like that may have made it more enjoyable for me kinda like when you havent read a book a movie is based off you have nothing to compare it to the show was great very entertaining good acting good writing excellent cgi and the pacing was perfect they did a good job at building a foundation for the world and its warring factions would highly recommend to someone who knows very little about the game im looking forward to the coming seasons
honestly even from the trailer there is hope this adaptation wont totally suck and boy did it deliver the world building the moral dilemmas the companions and the set and costume designs damn this is one of the most faithful adaptations to a video game ip ive seen yet the postapocalyptic landscape looks fantastic with a ton of familiar locations characters music and the story it keeps you engaged as it slowly unravels the main conspiracythis is a love letter to the franchise and is one of the best video game adaptations if not the best ive seen yet not only was it able to keep the vibe the feel and the aesthetic of the series perfectly intact it managed to create a cohesive plot with multiple perspectives the essence of fallout has a satirical lens to it the world is incredibly violent and dangerous but the inhabitants all deal with it differently some often with a morbid sense of humor there are plenty of moral choices to make and even though you dont get to make them yourself you get to see different perspectives and how each character makes the choice based on their own unique experienceslets go back to the character and set designs because the show absolutely nailed it the vaults had its retro aesthetic with a distinct futuristic look the first town was filled with garbage goons and makeshift shops the brotherhood of steel had its iconic power armor and advanced weaponry the ghouls with its fantastic makeup design and the absolute carnage and impact of various weapons the show managed to capture the style so remarkably consistent across many different locations and factionswhen the production is this faithful to the source material its hard to find any flaws because the positives overwhelmingly shadow the negatives you could argue certain characters are not your cup of tea but they still act cohesively based on their past experiences you could argue someone who hasnt played the video games might be left a bit confused or miss out on the familiar locations but the show does a great job showing you the lore by switching between the past and the present you can even argue the plot relies too much on being at the right place at the right time but that is always a flaw when you have a world this massive while following multiple charactersall in all this was an awesome adaptation which definitely got me revisiting the games again much like how cyberpunk edgerunners got me to finally play the game there are more stories to tell enemies to fight and locations to see we will see what happens next
not a gamer dont care how this compares blah blahhowever for over  decades i have been a fan of scifi movies books short stories and television this show is a wonderful progression of what classic scifi is all about it is beautiful to look at the castingacting is stellar the story is interesting and keeps you thinking like all good scifi it also says something about human nature lastly even though it has amazing effects the viewer is not over whelmed with all types of chaos and nonsense see the last few avenger movies on the screen this is very storyactor driven and the effects and simulated s supertech is such a wonderful visual featurewatch this it one of the best shows i have seen in a while
the fallout setting is supposed to be a somewhat tongue in cheek s america that just never ended so well up to the date of the nuclear war in  appliances cars homes clothing etc are like they have been stuck in time for  years the s music is still there as is the mom and pop culturethe intent is to ironically contrast that saccharine existence with the harshness of the apocalypse that arriveswell  this series kind of tanks that the casting is like a commercial for benneton or a un diversity program and not s america none of the hair styles fit none of the accents fit none of the word choices fit its like the series just ran over to the nearest mall found a bunch of kids and their parents and asked them to pretend to be in the fallout setting even the humour is typically straight from the millennial handbag with a ton of sarcasm and double entendresthis incongruity with the setting continues with the casting where brotherhood of steel recruits called aspirants some of whom have been training with the brotherhood as foot soldiers for most of their childhood look like they havent done a push up in their lives they dont look like recruits with years of physical training they look like their only battles were with controllers in their hands the notable use of a waifish almost skeletal actor to play the best aspirant in the pile the one chosen for promotion when that actor looks like they would struggle breaking bread or holding a coffee for any extended length of time is a good example they clearly cared more about that persons demographic makeup than they did whether they actually looked like what the role demandedthe main character from the vault is effectively a mary sue in the first episode she spouts her vault resume to convince the leadership of the vault that shes a good candidate for marriage to a man in another vault something they do to help the bloodlines shes literally good at everything she does from hand to hand to shooting to science to people to bravery to intelligence  her only flaw is being naive and that gets cured out of her quick so her one real flaw is more or less gone by the end of the first episodetheres a lot of nods to items people and places in the game but this is where it gets messy the absolute and utter retcon of the lore in at least four of the games by this series is well unforgivable an entire faction probably the most positive and interesting one is completely wiped off the earth it just doesnt existi watched long enough to learn that and then shut it off it was ok and moderately entertaining to that point with the caveats listed above but if you want me to swallow your casting nonsense and utter disregard for the setting at the same time thats just not going to happenive given it four stars out of deference to the games but this show isnt really all that good at all theres a lot of fans who will clearly vote it up because dogmeat is in it or the junk jet or a cool cowboy ghoul but the core jobs of making a compelling story the writing the casting and the sets only see one stand out the sets you really need all threethe retcon though unforgiveable the show runner should honestly be ashamed after saying time and time again that his show was canon that was  a lie
i dont really write many reviews but fallout blew me away i wasnt sure how well it could be adapted since the main character in the games is whoever you want them to be but this was amazingalong with the boys invincible reacher and now fallout amazon is the best streaming service for tv shows anything they touch seems to turn to gold whether your a fan of the games or not youll enjoy the show it perfectly captures the feel of the world of fallout like the game the show also ignores the main quest for all the side quests and thats when its at its bestwalton goggins and ella purnell steal the show as the ghoul and lucy you can really tell they are enjoying what they are doing the action is really well done its extremely violent and gory like the games i also like how they logically managed to incorporate stimpaksthe games way of healing into the show it was really well done i cant wait to see what they do with season 
fallout masterfully translates the beloved postapocalyptic universe of the game into a riveting television spectacle set against the backdrop of a nuclear ravaged world the series not only captures the grim aesthetics and expansive lore fans adore but elevates it with a deep narrative and complex charactersevery episode is a meticulously crafted piece of art the directors and writers have gone to great lengths to remain faithful to the original material while injecting fresh innovative storylines and character arcs that expand the franchises mythology the result is a richly layered world filled with morally ambiguous choices intense drama and a constant underlying threat that keeps viewers on the edge of their seatsthe casting is a triumph with each actor embodying their characters essence perfectly bringing to life the series iconic figures with vigor and authenticity the standout performances are complemented by uncompromising production values from the hauntingly beautiful cinematography and detailed set designs to the atmospheric score of the game itself bringing tension and emotion to the wastelandfallout is not just a series its an immersive experience the creators have achieved a delicate balance of action suspense and storytelling that hooks you from the first scene and doesnt let go whether youre a longtime fan of the games or a newcomer to the universe the series offers something for everyonea testament to its universal appeal and craftsmanshipit is a masterclass in adaptation a series that not only meets the high expectations of its source material but surpasses them it stands as a beacon of how to bring video game narratives to the screen and with the westworld creator at the helm i cant wait to see how the next season pushes the boundaries even further and deepen the already rich tapestry of this world
the story here is not only pretty fantastic but it seems to be serving as an overarking narative linking together every game as opposed to watering down the importance of the individual stories of each game this adds texture and depth that i didnt realise was missing despite the thousands of hours spent captivated of the sandbox worlds and immersive gaming experiences of multiple titles if this is going to be the model for the tv series overall its quite geniusthere are some areas i feel that could have used more detail howeverwhen you play the games as important as the stories are the vast majority of game play is traversing a perilous wasteland where hazards are almost frequently upon the player at times we see a character in an area when we return we see that they have arrived at a new area more detail battling or escaping any of the many irradiated fauna or array of unsavory factions rather than simply arriving would have made this closer to the gaming experience or even perhaps running into a friendly faction as the wanderer works for multiple factions be that either of the lead characters or bothalso it would have been nice to see workstations in use when the were opportunities to do so as they are integral to gamesthese additions would have made a near perfect game adaptation which we will undoubtedly see more of with the recent successesthe attention to detail elsewhere was imbecilethis could well be in the running for at least nominations at next years awards run
this show is soo good i think that they would win some acting awards i loved walton goggings acting definitely in him as cooper howards flashbacks ghoul is definitely my favorite loved they show three different povs love how they reveals it all definitely getting a s i think that cooper howardthe ghoul definitely the main character of s never seen a show has so much awesome cinematography and if you are very comfortable with violence this would be a good show for you its a lot of different storyline than the games and i think the con is that episode  and  is okay but other stuff are great
you know one thing i will never get is the selfimportant attitude of fans from all the many toxic features todays global media communication suffers from one of the main source of the toxicity is the fanbase of any franchise ever i am tired of people not having the ability to enjoy whatever they want to enjoy i am tired of people not being able to have baselevel healthy discussions about literally anything today i am tired of studios taking advantages from catering fanbases with all kinds of honeypotting practices and the audience not having the minimal intelligence to see that and pull out their head from the bubble they live in we may think they the studios creators give any damn about distributing quality contents from their hands to live up to any expectations set by high standards of a franchise or to just simply make enjoyable products to the audience as you may know for now as a grown up that it is always about the money and nothing else especially in later timeswarcraft the beginning not so bad actually quite good for the effort could have been better and should have been continued prince of persia not good not bad somewhere in between forgettable mario bros never talk about it ever mortal kombat any of them not really  one for the nostalgia still we are not talking about quality entertainment assassins creed no the last of us give me a break episode  was probably the only good from the season but overall disjointed and underdeveloped on the most important parts street fighter same as for mortal kombat any uwe boll movies hell nahhere comes the show fallout based on one of my favorite franchises that i adore dearly simply because of its unique worldbuilding i cant get from any other franchises when the vaultboy appears on the screen of your pipboy smiling gives you a thumbs up how great you are as a player in the middle of a bloody gory most brutal shootouthacknslash combat against random raiders in the middle of the most depressing dystopian future while some upbeat oldie is playing on the radio giving you one of the most unique grotesque satire filled with darkhumor in its coolest formsand you know what the show simply did the impossible and giving you the vibe you would always expect from a fallout story the tone dark yet humorous vibe the absurdity its randomness the multilayered philosophical questions on the works of humanity society group mentality the evolution of different worldviews with allkinds of possibilities the brutality goriness the depressing conclusions of high efforts with minimal payoffsthe overall substance of the show simply described looks like this they put  individuals into a meeting room asked every one of them to describe what fallout means to them collected the answers poured them mixed them together and made a show based on that with high understanding of the franchise and moviemaking in general and thank god they asked the right people had the right artists to execute these visions because damn it is written and acted overseerdamn good audiovisually narrated on the highest level to ever achieve on a seriesi am shocked honestly how good this turned out to be everyone was praising the last of us as something groundbreaking and best adaptation to a game but come on it wasnt that good at all way off base especially compared to thisthe right team right people at the right time with the right visions everything works amazingly here god bless the team behind fallout and god bless america
yes one of those rare shows that we picked up on the day of release watched it in a couple of days enjoyed it thoroughlywatching this reminded me a lot of westworldi havent played the games  didnt know anything about them but that doesnt matter you dont need to knowi like the way fallout plays history action in say  to  years into the future its clever and believable scifi the imagery is strong and themedthe action is good  very good i liked the storylines of the central characters which developed and delivered the overarching stories are compelling good scifi its got its own sense of humour tooa weakness is that fallout is a little predictable also we see quite a lot of the vaults and vault dwellers but we dont see enough of the other tribes maybe season  will give us moreoverall  fallout season  is a strong opening
"so is showgood enough for new to lorehave not seen all atm as a topic but for  first episodes
as an old fallout game player and i mean fallout  and fallout  in late s this is truly tingeling all my gamer memories from the fallout one to four and vegas too so many inside jokes and references to all game that just made me think how someone who doesnt know anything about the game feels of the showbecause i think show is a very good but i do know that game lorehopefully people who havent played the game willl enjoy show as much as i but i can understand if its difficult to understand whitout playing games"
i guess reviews for the show are written by diehard fans or maybe people now ready to eatup whatever content they can get that looks good i mean it the show does look great it gets postapocalyptic aesthetics to the t and is filled with little details that are capable to tell a story of their own in a game this would be a real achievement and it was even though i never got into fallout series i can admit that it had high detalization of the world throughout at least in the main series games that i did trybut even for a game its not enough you need a good story and good gameplay there too i never liked the gameplay part of the series it just did not click with me unlike the elder scrolls but tv shows dont need to bother with that tv show creators job is much easier then rightin my opinion these tv show creators fail at their job i often complain about series that have too much talking without using visual to tell the story this one is the reverse there is too little of talking or at least of talking that would develop character world of move plot along some reviewers did notice this as well pointing out that it feels like screenwriters were writing for a game and for tvif this was a short movie this might have been fine but for tv show  not so much for me it was boring only the first part of the st episode was somewhat interesting to me it was a cliche but still a good starting point for a story a sheltered society gets raided and that forces a character or characters to go outside of that society and learn about the world but then we switch to part of that outside world and its not as interestingits not just brotherhood of steel but the outside world in general the creators are trying too hard to make it look uncivilized or militaristic or sterile or just weird and as result it all feels forced as if they had a list of things to show and they progressed through the story by checking items off that listat the least i think they should have used just  main plotline with the girl leaving shelter it could have become a travelshow with fishoutofthewater theme and each episode could have explored all the weirdness of this strange world while the girl was moving forward you know a bit like the th kingdom back from  but postnuclear alas we have what we have as is i would rather rewatch silo it was not a perfect show but it was much more interesting to me
first of all huge fan of the fallout series i was worried that the show wasnt going to be all that this is exactly how a show based off a video game should be made this is the best tvmovie based off a video game yet last of us was good but this whole show has been phenomenal from start to end the attention to detal is fantastic hats off to everyone involved in making this my girlfriend has never played and has never heard of fallout the show does a great job in captivating audiences that know nothing about the franchisei love that they use music used in the games and for trailers for the games i love everything about this show
really worried about this series first of all i absolutely love the games and with all of the past rubbish attempts to adapt a game i feared for thisbut i didnt need to worry mr nolan has done a fantastic job the characters are great the action is good the settings are just as good as i hoped they would be but under all that and for all of those who have never played the games there is a really good story for those who know the games it brings it all to life and for those that dont it will show you why you should play the gamesella purnell is perfect as the nieve vault dweller that has never known the outside of her nice safe underground home that keeps them safe from the radioactive surface following nuclear apocalypse  years ago but the need arrives to go outside and her world views and expectations are shattered and a superb journey and story beginfully recommend this and as i have an idea of what is coming for the next season it is only going to get better as well
when you take something long established and very well loved and adapt it for the screen it needs to be near perfect or those little imperfections start to grate on the fans of the original mediumi was so apprehensive when i heard they were making a fallout tv show could they really capture those post apocalyptic visuals could they really capture the humour that runs through this dark and deadly world i mean reallyapparently yes is the resounding answer jaw dropping visuals and laugh out loud moments amongst all the flying gooey bits its an absolute blast and i loved every minute of it
star trek battlestar galactica game of thrones falloutok dr who if we had  faces the point is its that good we all knew walton goggins was gonna what he does since the shield we know hes been doing it every single time how this man is not buried under the weight of multiple oscars and emmys is a question for all of hollywood what we did not see coming is ella purnell ella carushes it here as lucy with one lip snarl she conveys fear and confidence in the same well lip snarl she goes from okey dokey newlywed to okey dokey survivalist to okey dokey stone cold killer the lucy mclean she portrays could successfully sell me everything from toothpaste and hair conditioner to armor piercing bullets to santa clausnever played the game and do not give two fs to ever do so this series is all it needs to be the world building character development editing music props wardrobe everything are all fantastic
i was sceptical at first as it is hard to capture gameplay on the tv although this show was fantastic you felt like you were immersed right into the world of fallout with some recognisable landmarks the story is its own entity and doesnt follow any of the games story lines which in a way i love it gives the writers the ability to have free reign and introduce new characters into the mix the storyline was great it kept me wanting more and i sadly binge watched it all im hoping for a season  as this will be one of my highly anticipated watches i recommend this show to anyone even if you arent a fallout game player
"i went into this highly skeptical i played the games when i was younger and i didnt want to watch an adaptation that would tarnish my memories of the wasteland this series exceeded all my hopes and expectations it reminded me why i love the universe of fallout theres something so charming about postwar optimism resonating amidst nuclear apocalypsewhat they do well
they found the best actress to play their vaultee she captures the look and idiosyncrasies of a s cartoon character and her enthusiastic okie dokie never fails to bring levity to an otherwise grim situationthe series revives our favorite character from the game dogmeat a wasteland mutt who could singlehandedly carry the show if he had tothe music selection preserves those special feelings from games  and  where youre feeling like nothingnot even a swarm of radioactive roachescan stand between you and your destinywhat people seem to dislike
other reviewers complain that the tone is inconsistent which seems a bit inflexible fallout is known for merging genres and maintaining a happygolucky vault dwelling attitude amidst the grotesqueries of radiation and rampant violence its dark humor its not for everyone but i dont see this as a fault in the writinggenrepeople complain that this world is inconsistent with the world of the videogame i dont see this as an issue either as the creators are working in a different media entirely i never expected this work to be canon with the game franchises universe it is a love letter to the game and its fanbase i couldnt be happier with what theyve given us"
the history of video game adaptations in hollywood is certainly dubious lazy productions and general disdain for the source material has led to decades of one of the worlds most complex art forms being undervalued and underrepresented in filmbut with recent series like fallout and the last of us it seems like the tide may be shifting it could have something to do with the video game industry surpassing all other entertainment sectors in revenue by a huge marginwhatever the reason is for this new renaissance of video game adaptations im here for itfallout in particular is an impressive showing of what can happen when filmmakers understand the source material while the last of us is certainly a highquality show with tremendous acting and a professional production it very closely follows an existing story that has already been told with a worldclass deftness in a different mediumall they really needed to do was follow the path already set for themthis is not the case with fallout which dares to be creative enough to give the fandom a brandnew story in the revered franchise and its good enough to go right into the head canon next to all the games all of which ive playedthe brutality of the wasteland the comedic tone the environmental storytelling the cutesy juxtapositions against the harsh despair the distinctive art style and everything else fallout is represented here with a true masterstroke of direction and set designin particular lucy our fishoutofwater vaultdweller from vault  and the ghoul our prewar cowboyturnedghoul bountyhunter are story standouts these two actors carry every scene on their backs like its effortless i expected walter goggins to put in a good performance as he always doesbut ella purnell was a surprise scenestealer for me i wasnt sold on her from the trailers but her weirdness her impeccable timing and her wideeyed naivety giving way to hints of darkness immediately ingratiated me to her characteri can no longer imagine anyone else as lucywhat is perhaps even more impressive about the fallout series is the cinematography the props and the set designs the attention to detail to ensure this series fits into the lore with a proper respect is beyond commendable its legendary a lot of money was spent to faithfully recreate the wasteland and it shows if youve played the video game i cant see how youll be disappointed with this aspect of the showof course its not all perfect but what isthere are some pacing issues in episodes  and  some of the comedy is very leftfield and offbeat which may turnoff some viewers the brotherhood storyline is also a bit of a missed opportunity especially given the rich history of the organization plus the monster cgi featuring creatures like radroaches and gulpers feels pretty bgrade in some areasthese minor grievances werent enough to detract from the overall brilliance of the seriesno to the contrary fallout season  is a masterpiece its a testament to what can be achieved with an adaptation if the source material is given the proper veneration and admirationamazon prime has a certified hit on their hands and they have made a legion of fans very happy lets hope they keep this momentum heading into season while it isnt flawless the fallout series is about as perfect as can be with this kind of translation i never thought it could be possible butits a rare 
i was excited for the show to come out though i had limited expectations ive only played new vegas and fallout  loved boththe show to me seems a bitlight hearted one review called this the disney version of fallout and i think thats a perfect comparison there wasnt much danger when traveling outside and the people inside seemed like campy people from the s like a leave it to beaver castthe show also bounced around far too much and i dont feel that that they handled that all too well often i had to ask myself did i miss somethingtwo last pointsthere was zero explanation as to why moldaver was still alive shes a key character kinda feels like that should have been touched on and at the beginning the raiders were radioactive but werent scanned
just finished the series and this is from the perspective of some one that grew up playing fallout in the s that still has a metal fallout poster on his walloverall i thought it was pretty good the series started with a bang slowed down with some cheesy scenes like the sentry systems mini gun completely missing for about  rounds or the best mercenary in the west not being able to shoot a girl before an inexperienced man wearing power armour can tackle her to the ground but it all came together in the end with the last episode was easily a the world and set designs were very well done  a lot of it true to the lore even with little things like iguana on a stick or junk items picked up in lockers in the gamethat said there were many times throughout especially the early episodes where i thought it was a little too colorful and not gritty enough almost disneyfied they captured a lot of the gorecombat quirks a good amount of the unruliness hopelessness a lot of the bethesda humour and a glimpse of the old school interplayblack isle twisted humour in certain scenesat times it did feel a little a little too  with a pip boy with the studio checking off every box in the current hollywood trope checklistcriticisms aside id still suggest it as a good series to check out as a purist theres a lot missing but as a standalone tv show its a solid watch with a unique story set in the fallout worldif youre on the fence see it through the ending episode negated nearly all of my complaints looking forward to season 
the writers and directors of the show really get the essence of the fallout franchise from the clueless and naivete vault dweller to the religious zealot of the brotherhood of steel the use of the fallout music and vats system limbs being shot off give you a feel of playing the game the creators bring a realism form video game to live tv when watching the show i could not help but sing along which brings me back great memories of playing the games the shows fun quirky humor has me rolling but also can have its serious moments having me on the edge of my seats wanting more all and all the director and writes do a wonderful job and show is fun to watch
a lot of people i saw have complained about the contrast between the show and some of the game characters and i think the most important thing to note is that this show is not an adaptation of any fallout game the basic plot of the lead follows some of fallout  the brotherhood follows a bit of fallout  but i was delighted that they didnt risk messing any previous characters or plots up and instead chose their own additionin terms of the fallout world this show seems almost entirely emerged into it the show runners worked closely with the game creators and it shows so when people criticize the relevance to the game they are criticizing the game creators as wellthe show isnt perfect nor could it be nothing with as passionate as a fan base as fallout could fully satisfy the masses but so far it has done an incredible job ive heard talks of a season  either continuing these characters or becoming ahs anthology style but either way i am as happy as i can be with a video game adaptation
im two episodes in and im already obsessed the story line is great the acting is great the videography is beautifully done the music just like the game while only being a fre episodes in i still feel compelled to tell others to watch this immediately this could also come from a selfish place as i dont want them to cancel this show and i want a second season again already in love this this so you all know what to do watch this rate this and then make a second third and even fourth season happen do it for the people do it for the surface dwellers do it for the vault dwellers do it for me okay that is all
first i dont consider myself a gamer and my only prior experience with this franchise is from having played a bit of fallout shelter a very basic and simple spinoff on mobile my partner has played several of the real fallout gamesbut much like the last of us this series stands on its own without any familiarity or investment in the video games the characters are complex and welldeveloped and the world building is absolutely astounding any fan of scifi nuclear apocalypses andor dystopias will probably have a lot of fun with it and unlike the last of us fallout is filled to the brim with morbid and edgy humor along with a generous helping of kitschthe primary setting is the american wastelands hundreds of years after a nuclear apocalypse which occurred in a futuristic atompunk s that earlier era is also featured in numerous flashbacks as more is revealed about vaulttec the enigmatic corporation which created the vaults still occupied by the descendants of the original inhabitantsin that wasteland setting the main characters are introduced and eventually intersect sometimes repeatedly with each other as they all desperately chase the same valuable object for very different reasons and with none of them even knowing why its valuable
ill start it by saying i am a fan of the games and when i first saw the trailer i had my doubts many current day live adaptions have been abysmal in the last few years rings of power the witcher resident evil however this show finally breaks that moldthe show is good the main character lucy actually undergoes a decent character arc she is over trusting and kind to fault something you cant be in the hostile wasteland however when she does try to take matters in her own hands it can equally drastically backfire causing her to constantly doubt what is the right thing to do she is in no way a mary sue she gets bruised bloodied stabbed captured and again clearly is very naive as to how the world should work with dramatic consequences to her actionsthe world of fallout looks amazing from the designs of the retro style cozy vaults to desolate irradiated wasteland it very much captures the feel of the games the creatures also look great the irritated monsters are terrifying be they ghouls radroaches or giant abominations there are also plenty of easter eggs or winks to games for those who have played them and i personally loved how the story was split between the past of how the vaults came to existhistory of vault tech just before the great war and then current day survivors in the post apocalyptic wastelandis the show perfect no which is why its not a  but its not bad either again as someone who played the games i really enjoyed this series i really dont understand the negativity because this is leaps and bounds better that netflixs treatment of the witcher or what rings of power did to lotr but hey not everything is for everybody
so like the title says i am  episode in i have played  and new vegas so i know the lore and design and overall gameplay with all that said i dont see any reason this show is below a  after  episode yeah we got box checking roles and yeah we got unnecessary sex and yeah we got a character that doesnt make sense in regards to the game but other than that it all looks great between the nuka cola machine and the sugar bombs to grognak and pipboys im liking it even a raider shot jet or was it psycho in this episode thats about as close as you can get showing a character shoot drugs from the game onscreen nonstop homage to the gamesyes like i menationed earlier the above ones i mentioned are lows for the show and yes i see others say the steel armor looks fake i agree in a way but i need to see it used in combat and how its portrayed before i make a decision it looks pretty close to fallout s armor i seen someone mention new vegas not seeing anything like that here actually the ncr and the legion would be great to have on a big screen sprinkling in bos and enclavetheres a easter egg in the game i just dont get the low reviews from so called gamers of this unless it completely changes i think its ok give me a deathclaw and a mirelurk and some energy weapons and ok throw in some radiation and boomskiesst edit starting episode  im not sure what creature that was in  but it wasnt anything like a mirelurk unless it was a mirelurk king maybe a made up one not sure no idea how it died either maybe the human was poison idk im dropping a point for that and no weapons being used really where was the laser gun and that giant rifle squire was given in the bagnd edit  episodes left for season  and we get an ncr power armor spotting so this is supposedly somewhat in new vegas territory cool no change in ratingfinal edit so the mirelurk i called it is an enemy from fallout  called a grouper i think ahh started that game couple weeks ago and havent made it that far to kill one yet season  is basically an intro to the fallout game series which i dont mind its good to get the non game players caught up on the design and plot the problem with this is theres little action and little enemiescharacters we see we get a lot of fallout lore between nuka cola robco dogmeat etc but very few enemies maybe saving the budget for season  idk but we need ghouls super mutants raiders rad scorpions etc we got none of that in season  and those enemies are in all the games staples least the recent platform ones  is a valid rating
so you take the vast imaginative world of fallout you take whatever billions of dollars of budget practically any actor or actress you want out there and you come up with this its so bad its shameful cardboard conversations acting so dull it killed any interest i had and i forced myself to see through the edit of predictable scenes that is the first episode if it wasnt for the sex and violence i wouldve thought that this was aimed at children fallout is cheesy and fun this is like a sitcom with laugh track everything is so over explained obvious the cringe i get from thinking that someone put thought barely effort and money into this hurts me after a while of watching such a waste  minutes of bad slow mo fight scene with cute music is not doing it for me anymore not after seeing it for the th time nolan listed cliches in this series and also the main character who did the casting someones intern nephew i find it hard to believe that someone so bad at acting is the star of this show when there are so many talented people out there
ive been playing the fallout series since i was  ive never been too much into it but enough to know lore the series has been great yes it was a little confusing until everything locked into place but i couldnt stand the sexual scenes yes fallout does hint to stuff like that but its not pornagraphic like some of those scenes were there is never full nudity in the games either unless you get mods for it i wish that it was more like the games and would have faded with the sexual scenes instead of full on show them no the show wasnt perfect but it was never going to be and the people complaining about them basically ruining new vegas it doesnt the story line is lore accurate and is supposed to take place after new vegas im not too sure how long after but it is it would be worth watching over and over again if there was either no full on sex scenes or you could be allowed to skip them i thought the show was great but it really could have done without all the sexual stuff and full on nudity i hope the next season has less nudity than what it had great plot line i wish that it would have had more feral ghouls there wasnt really any hordes of ghouls like there are in the games hopefully better and more things will be in store for the next season
overall the show is great and at the end we are left wanting more but i feel the show started very strong then several episodes were just kind of mediocre then the last  were really good i am definitely looking forward to the next season the visuals are fantastic the plot is pretty darn good albeit slightly messy and the actors are top notch walton goggins is just absolutely amazing and we wouldnt expect any less of him there are some cool innovative quirky aspects to the show that make it unique also they dont hold back on the violence and gore at all give it a shot and stick with it the end is worth it
im an avid player of both fallout and the last of us and so far both adaptations have been done right to say the leastboth series have nailed the environment the feel and the important narratives involved in the gamesfallout is stunning reminiscent and a treat for gamers with the references to the vault the wastelands cogsworth my favorite pipboys nuka cola and so much moreaction sequences are choreographed with incredible details and the costumes are perfectionalso the casting was surprising in the best way matt berry as cogsworth is a slamdunkbethesda and naughty dog keep it coming
fallout as a show is something i have been waiting for and now that it is here its amazing i totally thought this would be a flop but they nailed it they made the show just as the game a colourful environment with much brutality and its just like the game the first episode got me hookedstory wise i enjoy it while it is another concept we still got characters and i am just amazed with how the brotherhood of steel is portrayed just righton to the acting and the feeling in just  minutes of the first episode they make you feel tied to the characters and i dont want to spoil but the first  minutes got me feeling emotionalthis show is amazing
ok so i am a fallout fan boy and i have played the games since the first one came out and i was very excited about these series ofc i kept my hopes low but oohhh my goodness i was in for a surprise this show really captured the essence of the game and truly it did a great job actors were fantastic the script was superp and the cinematic visualization was phenomenal i give this serie  out of  starsthe ghoul and lucy are characters i will not forget as the actors did really good job and stayed true to the gamesalso all other characters really did seem they were just picked up out from random fallout game down to every little aspectgreat story great actors beautiful fxthanks for the best show i have seen in years
having played all of the fallout games i found myself wanting to participate in the show explore collect shoot stuff watching was great good stories seeing all the paraphernalia and familiar items wish there was a way to interact with the show maybe they will come up with an expansion pack that follows the shows storyline acting is great costumes are great backgrounds are great it was different to see what would have been npcs being acted out by real people i kept looking for easter eggs im guessing there were some but i didnt see any looking forward to more episodes and other shows based on video games skyrim next
really good and respects source materialinsightful commentary on human nature episode sixseven was particularly good with its prewar depiction of the fallout universe and the society norms and governing powers the lore around the corporations involved in vaulttec was exactly as you would imagineone thing is for sure you will need to play the games again after this usually tv shows based on games takes you further away from your imagination with a game but this show has made me feel even more immersedalso shoutout to props and detail in every episode it just feels like it was all put together by people who really love falloutthis show is a winner
so the problem with the reviews is that almost all are people who played the video game i did not and watched this as a stand alone series it was so lamesuch a cool idea as a story but had no substance at all if you want to watch an underground bunker story i recommend cloverfield lanei literally turned it off after  minutes so maybe i didnt give it a chance but the acting sucked the cgi was horrible why are they wearing matching suits anyway and why are so many games being made into movies except the legend of zelda ocarina of time which is definitely the best game of all time give it a go if you are not a gamer be forewarned this is a little lameedit i got through  episodes i thought all this hype surely meant it would be good i would rather watch paint dry why anyone rates this above a  is beyond me this show is absolutely awful in my personal opinion
when i first heard they were going to do a tvseries adaptation of one of my favorite computer games i was very excited but also a bit unsure if they would manage to pull it off its such a big undertaking since the fallout games and the universe where they take place is a culture in it self turns out i didnt need to worry cuz theyve done a tremendous work the attention to details in the falloutworld is spot on everything is there the architecture the quirky music the scenery the strange food the monsters you name it d im enjoying every minute of itat the time of writing im halfway trough the season so ive no idea how it ends but regardless im already hoping for a season  d i want to see more of this
this show nailed fallout in every bit the vault  the dwellers  the wasteland and the show started as you might start any fallout game a pre war intro skip  years vault dwellers then the protagonist goes out to the open world to look for good old dad again loli doubted the power armors were going to look stupid but it was done perfectly even the ghoul guy looked amazing and i loved the addition of the classic music this is the trademark for fallout generallymaximus represents all fallout fans once you get into the power armor best feeling everwaiting for season  already
this is easily the best video game adaptation ever but also a really fun show captures the essence of the fallout universe the actors are great and the character development was a lot of fun to watch it unfold quirky characters and situations i could see some of my play through styles in all of the main characters the evil one morally ambiguous and the saintthis show rekindled my love for fallout and i just reinstalled fallout  on my xbox and am finally going to take on all the dlc contentonly one complaint is that some of the armour and guns looked a bit fake at times but what can you do
fallout should go done as one of the best if not the best game adaptions to screen bingeworthy confection that even those unfamiliar with the game should enjoy the aesthetics are the future envisioned as if from a s perspectivegoggins and purnell shine in their respective roles with purnell bringing a surprising comedic naivete to her performance goggins is just perfection in what is essentially playing two characters though same personfallout has some interesting cameos through the season prime went all out on this show the production values are top notch movie level the humor is dark and well timed but id say the best thing that amazon did with fallout is really capture the feel atmosphere and spirit of the original game im excited for more season and full expect there to be more
from everything ive heard  read the show is pretty loyal to the game which i love its wonderful when a piece of media is true to the source material it makes it even better for the fans who made it popular enough to become a showmovie so cheers to yallnow as someone who never played the games and doesnt know a darn thing about it this was a hell of a fun ride i stayed up til am watchingl love walton coggins casting he is so perfect in everything he puts his name on but i also enjoyed every single second of this show im so glad i took a risk on something that isnt usually up my aisle  
this show is seriously awesome it offers everything fallout is about i grew up playing the games religiously and i couldnt be more happier with this adaptation it exceeded my expectations for the ones who are giving it  thats insane you can watch something like this and leave that type of review sorry your predictions were wrong basement dwellers yall dont need to try and bomb the ratings in spitei hope to see many more seasons of this show and i cant wait to see what else jonathan nolan has lined up thank you prime for a great adaptation on such an amazing video game and overall story
it is absolutely perfect as a lifelong fallout fan this checked every single box and i could not ask for a better adaptation of the fallout universe on screen every single thing on this show is perfect the writers really took the time to make sure they checked every box from the vaults to the wasteland to the pipboys they left no detail overlooked and that made this show amazing not to mention the actual plot line was fantastic i could go on for days about that but the rest of the show was amazing i could immerse myself in this universe and would not ask for anything better i cannot wait for season two
fallout is set in a clumsily puttogether postnuclear apocalypse world based on the computer game of the same namewhile it boasts some impressive sets the convoluted plot brings out mediocre at best from the actors who merely go through the motions of the drab storyline that is as bleak as the apocalyptic world itselfit appears that creating a tv series based on a popular computer game has become a common trend similar to how computer games used to be developed from tv shows or movies honestly they neednt have bothered watching your kids playing the game over their shoulders is more entertaining unless youre a diehard fan of the game this is one to miss
im a big fan of the games and the show capture the essence of this world very well but there are some elements that dont make any sensethe biggest problem is the last universe i dont know if its the writers politics opinion getting in the way or what but i remember watching the first episode with a friend and trying to come up with the worst ending this show could have just for laughs and everything that we said would be the most stupid thing ever happened in the last episodeits really dissapointing cause i was really enjoying everything before the whole thing is actually explained
"i started watching the video game saga as a fan i finished it as a fan of the film saga spectacular both for those who can understand the many quotes and for those who are approaching the world of fallout for the first time without having ever heard of it speaking
lets talk about what we see on stage each episode seems like a film more than an episode of a tv series formidable direction spatial photography that gives the viewer that sense of wonder that only in fallout games a postapocalyptic world can give we cannot leave out the special effects that leave the viewer more and more surprised episode after episode but what really moved me was the attention to detail nothing was out of place nothing was put at random every object character and directorial choice follows always a logical thread faithful to the narrative universe in which the events take place in each episode we note the constant participation of the team of developers of the video game saga with whom it was possible to bring a perfect and healthy fan service while remaining true to themselves without distorting the productreally well done cant wait for the next seasons hoping there will be many more "
if you have been a fallout video game fan you will more than likely love this show they did a great job of bringing the game to life the environments the characters the plot line the music and many other things i am sure i am forgetting feel like they were pulled right out of the gamemy wife also loved fallout too and she knows very little about the game other than the hours she did not see me while playing it she said the story the acting the music the set and costume design were all amazingwe both loved that they took the time to develop the characters in the beginning instead of jumping into the story it gives a more emotional connection to the characters as the story developsoverall i would say this was very well done and cannot wait to see any upcoming seasons if you havent watched it yet i highly recommend it
have been a fan of the fallout universe since before it was even fallout it was influencedborrowed heavily from a game in the late s called wastelandi am someone who loved the lord of the rings movies and hated rings of power some movies respect the ip intellectual property they are based on and some diredctorswritersshowrunners think theyre smarter than the original author or the audience that made it popular in the first placewell all i can say is  not here while introducing new characters and a new part of the world they catch the flavor of the fallout post apocalyptic world in everything whether its the vaulttec themes the actual music from the game or literal flavor items like cram instead of spam or the deviled eggsso as a longtime fan i am very very well pleasednow the acting  absolutely love it the main characters have heart and go back and forth between human and shock a bit of gore to surprising kindness in this harsh world i mean what more needs be said about walton goggins of course hes a scene stealer but hes also unpredictable and you never know what hes going to pull im very much reminded of his character boyd crowder in justifiedi do have to admit aaron motens character is definitely giving me flashbacks from the star wars sequel trilogy where john boyega played something of a fish out of waterwant to be neophyte goodguy type though i have to admit i like motens character a lot better the writing is infinitely better and i cant blame boyega for the horrible writing he had to deal withand itd be very unkind not to mention ella purnells lucy who really is something of the face of the franchise and with those huge lovely eyes of hers one can understand why but her character is bright and inquisitive and learns quickly from her mistakes somehow keeps her sense of humor and yet the writers and directors have shied away from the popular trend of making every female a mary sue and instead having respected women by giving her room to grow  ditto all the main characters honestly even three episodes in its plain to seesecondary characters and story arcs arent forgotten either they really give this world depth just bc lucy leaves the vault doesnt mean the audience doestldr the producersactorswritersdirectors have avoided the mistakes that beset so many productions these days they take their time building up both the world the sets and the story letting the characters develop and letting the audience learn about the world right along with the charactersif they keep up this level of development they surely deserve many seasons to come
so i have played the game a bit but mainly just loved the art and world building of fallout since its inceptionand when i heard amazon was making a tv showi had my doubts especially as hype and overhype grew but man did this show deliverit had some fan service but never detracted from the story and the story was great the acting was on point i thought maybe it might be a little goofy or weird but man did they make it all workit even had high emotional moments that i was not expecting nor was i prepared forthe formula used here could make so many other tv shows be greatly improved meaning build a story impactful characters that embodies what made the franchise great but doing it in a manner that is original the fact that my wife lik d it priced that the show built e great show that catered to more than just a gamer niche and that is how shows need to be builtbased on my individual episode scores i had a lot of s but collectively as a show its a  and i rarely rank anything a 
i wasnt expecting much from the series when i first saw the trailers but in short it delivered it is a story that doesnt rely much on you knowing the lore and is a great introduction to the franchise great cinematography and direction amazing acting surprisingly good original music great story and fan service it is a mature series like others from amazon and it doesnt shy away from showing some graphic content so its up to par with the games if youve played any of the games youll feel right at home in this great series that has already set up season  with an amazing teaser that will get fans waiting for whenever the next season comes out as a fan of the games and of good television i give it  pretty biased
with how the witcher and other highly praised games have been televised into shows i didnt have high hopes for fallout i havent played the games but so many of my friends have and everyone was afraid to get hyped up only to be let down i saw the trailer and wasnt really that interested but boy did that trailer not kiss and tell after i got some hype recommendations from friends i decided to give fallout a chance and from episode  i was in the acting the music the props the storytelling the camera angles and details its just chefs kiss the showrunners have managed to tell a story with humor and suspense and this amazing world has come to life in the most brilliant way i take my hat off to everyone involved and cant wait for season 
"overall up untilthe th episode i was willing to ignore the flaws and holes and felt it was a decent  star show then the last episode and a half happens and i couldnt handle the stupidity of the writing and flawsfirst the positives
aesthetic is great really feels like an apocalyptic worldwalton goggims is amazing as the cowboy and the ghoul he does an amazing job his is also the best storyline and i wanted moteella purnell also put in a solid performance as sarah especially when she was playing the innocent woman from the shelter however the horrible writing in the last  episodes even wastes hernow for the badmaximus is a terrible character and the actor who plays him is terrible hated him and his storylinecringe writing if you can shut your brain off and not think about the plot it can be quite enjoyable i was able to do thus for  episodes but it was too much once you get to the end last episode is by far the worst and think about the rest of the series it is a clown show none of what happens makes any sense their plans are stupid way too many coincidences and writing conveniences its a cast world yet characters continually run into each other certain storylines go nowherethis show was not horrible but not good wither a total mixed bag the horrific writing ultimately makes it unrecommendable by me the shame is with a tighter plot and better writing this could have been great by the way i have never played the games"
i am astonished at how the writers producers cast and crew brought this show to life not only do they portray and perfectly match the feeling of the game but they have created an original story thats interesting colorful and executed meticulously to keep the audience interestedthe story acting concepts artistic direction visuals and a persistence to creating something unique and interesting are all there i will definitely watch this a second time and i hope that there is a season  tv should always be this goodi am a fallout fan but i know that even if i never heard of the games this would become one of my favourite shows of all time a huge congratulations to the creators you have proven to the world that game adaptations can be well made if care is taken with the scripts acting staging directing and producing bravo to the whole team
this was an unexpectedly good series and it certainly portrays the greedy and twisted human nature well willing to sacrifice all kinds and the entire world for blind dreams i really liked the ghouls and the intrigue in the bunkers the blind role of the brotherhood is as significant as the inquisition what the directors didnt consider is the fact that malinois dogs if they lose their owner or handler lose their sense of purpose and dont join just anyone they meet everything else was well executed congratulations and big ups im eagerly awaiting the next part   a big massacre 
am not sure how to put it  its different from everything i have seen and at the same time it as some very familiar places although stephen king is not related to this it reminded me a lot of the black tower the books the way i saw it in my imagination at the same time it is a very political series  far more political than the black tower and so true  we watch this very sci fi serie and we can relate to everything that is wrong in this world and with capitalist  in this after apocalypse world the main characters are nor good our bad they are all very different among them and loved to se the interconnection between such a variety of people and believes  it leaves you with a taste of sweetness and bitterness 
as a long fan of the video game series  i truly respect and love this adaption of the series dont usually binge watch shows but i just had to with this and i am not dissapointed quite on the contrary  the characters are great each with own struggles in the world yet they all see through their differences and focus on the mission  fallout  fans will definetly enjoy the journey of lucy and relate to how it starts and unfolds some episodes in the middle may be a slight drag at times but that quickly gets outshined by the lore  at this moment i recommend this show and await season  try it 
the people leaving negative reviews on thisgood grief you must hate everything this show is fun gory hilarious and completely engagingthe characters are great the settings immersive and the storyline is compelling i love that they gave a backstory to the vaulttec character as someone who really enjoyed playing fallout  this was a total treat and if i may be so bold probably the best video game adaptation to dateand thats coming from someone who really loved the last of ussit back snack on some cram and sugar bombs pop the top on a nuka cola and enjoy this fun showbravo
my three sons now in their s all played the game and all have watched the show and endorsed ita baby boomer i am on episode five and am thoroughly enjoying it perhaps my favorite part is watching walter gogginsthere are a few weak points like the guy who plays maximus as others have said hes not an especially good actor nor is he a sympathetic character the campiness is presented at face value and the costumes set design soundtrack and overall direction are superb in my opinionyou dont have to be a fan of the game or even that aware of it  i watched it from time to time when my sons were playing  but if you are into scifi and good series with character arcs give this show a try
this show is absolutely amazing one of the best video game adaptations of all time great story great cast great action scenes its actually funny and not annoying the violence is incredible you can tell they put some budget in there the visuals are incredible soundtrack is as any fallout soundtrack is 🔥 walton goggins is great at his role kinda reminds me of john marston from red dead redemption  if he was scorched by radiation having the creator of the games most of them todd howard himself as a producer was a great idea they really did an amazing job bringing fallout to the small screen and also to all those who put  and  🖕
we made it through three episodes before giving up the story was a simple quest that we have seen in various iterations a million times it is just a gamer plot which is fair enough considering the source but its boring and the various plot holes are bigger than santa monicaacting is generally fine especially walton goggins fantastic makeup its the best part of the show but they dont have that much to do this plot mediocre scripts and humor that far more often than not falls flatthe cgi scenery of la the theme building at lax randys donuts is pretty spectacular but the set pieces in various camps and towns is more often done on the cheap and looks it
i never thought it possible that they could do a tv show based on the fallout games but here we arethe show is set after all the games of which i have played them all id say this story is more of a cross between fallout  and fallout  and is closer to them two timelineswe follow vault  which has yet to open and access the wasteland of the united states vault  is situated in la which hasnt featured in the games beforeeverything in the show is very familiar with the games and i instantly recognised the style and the colours the settings and the musicafter a really good opening in  when disaster strikes we shift to the year  over  years in the future and nearly  years after the finale of fallout without giving much away lucy from vault  is thrust out into the open on a quest yo find her father we also follow a soldier of the brotherhood of steel an initiatescribe called maximus as well as a ghoul  radiated human  called cooper howardthere are other familiar sects and groups from the games who populate the world the tv show is setthe overall vibe of the show is quirky but dystopian and violent expect gore and blood and some mild sex scenesthe cinematography is excellent and this is a fast paced show that does not get bogged down in exposition nor melodrama yet the depth of the games is there if you know the games you might not get all the details or history of prior events but the games were all seperate stories as well with very little character crossover and the tv show follows this ideologyim not sure why there is some low reviews maybe female and black leads is too much for some most reviews are good and i totally agree its an  out of  could be a  even this is a good adaptation of the games and the games core settingthe violence and dystopian anarchic setting may put people off but within all of this is hope and human character
this show is beautiful the design the makeup and costumes high attention to detail i agree it doesnt accurately follow the fallout game series but who cares theyve taken a good concept and run in a different direction the show taken on its own merits does not disappoint i see a lot of comments discussing how the show isnt dark and gritty it doesnt need to be we all know whst to expect from a post apocalyptic movie in my opinion this is more balanced and still suitably intense enough while maintaining a nice ease i thoroughly enjoy the mix and varied perspective on the post apocalyptic world bring on more
as a fan of fallout games i really enjoyed this television adaptation incredible set design amazing cast and story the opening few minutes left me with chills the background to the characters took a couple of episodes to develop as with all good stories a good balance for gamers and first time viewers although there might be a few pauses to explain the relationships of the characters if you are watching with someone who has had no exposure to the game as the episodes continued the show became more with purpose and suspense as for the people that refuse to watch another episode after the first one i suggest if you want to dump on something find a toilet looking forward to another season
i loved fallout  they really hit the spot with the whole fallout vibe going into the show s music violence but not too serious etc i loved the main character lucy thought she was great loved coop  the ghoul he was immense every episode i really enjoyed nostalgic for me but also unique and new and i just thought theyve done an amazing job id say its watchable even if you havnt played it is everything the last of us wasnt the plot was anything but predictable and left you guessing which is a rarity with all the predictable crap you mostly see nowadays absolute smash hit in my eyes and i cant wait for the next season so fun to watch all round
i dont usually write reviews but this show was just too incredible for me not to ive never played the fallout games but that didnt really make a different in how enthralled i was the show was so well done from the action to the comedic moments to the underlying plot that kept me and still has me on the edge of my seative loved ella purnell after watching her yellowjackets and she killed it as lucy walton goggins had the most standout performance of the season to me though he seamlessly played two characters and id be lying if i said i wasnt obsessed with the ghoulim now strongly considering playing the fallout games as i cant stop thinking about all the lore that lies behind such a massive game series ive watched the show once then watched some reactions to it and i am definitely going to watch it again
pretty gory and gruesome i loved that also liked that it began by showing the apocalyptic event that shaped this dystopian future i havent played the game so i cant make comparisons to it it seems like video game adaptations are becoming quite popular nowadays last of us halo and twisted metal good thing is you dont need to be familiar with the gamei love postapocalyptic shows so this was right up my alley i was almost always gonna like this i like the type of futuristic it is its like the cartoon the jetsons but dystopian i always find it ironic how futuristic dystopias sometimes incorporate really old music from the s into their soundtracksthis show is subtly yet notsosubtly geared towards adults despite its lightheartedness humor and fun its easy to forget the gruesome aspects like oh a decapitated head it maintains a childlike happy vibe largely due to the main characters naivety and optimism shes like a ray of sunshine too pure for the dystopian world she inhabits watching her character development as she learns the harsh realities is quite engaging however she remains fundamentally good throughoutall the main characters are compelling maximus despite his duality is a fascinating character to follow the ghoul initially cool adds emotional depth to the scifi drama and conspiracy through his backstory maximus story also adds complexity i do wish we could have seen more of the ghouls adventures but it seems like well get that in the next season the first season mainly focuses on lucy and maximusthe premise of the show revolving around a nuclear apocalypse and the conspiracies behind it feels believable for a scifi setting the contrast between the kind loving nature of the vault and the violence and moral ambiguity on the surface provides an interesting balance while i personally wouldve loved darker themes the shows lighter tone isnt necessarily a flaw its just a matter of my personal preference overall its a fun series and i thoroughly enjoyed watching it
as all of the other fallout game fans have indicated this series is an incredible recreation of everyting in the games  the characters the s vibe the music the costumes the props the gritty survive at all costs nature of the wasteland contrasting with the safe and organized valutswhat impressed me most was that my wife who is not a gamer doesnt like science fiction or historical settings and knew nothing about fallout really enjoyed the series although the violence was a bit much at times this says a lot about how well the characters dialogue and plot were created and evolved through the seriescongratulations to amazon on investing in this series and delivering on everyones expectationscant wait for season 
i was so excited about this series because fallout games are familiar to me unfortunately i am kinda disappointed i dont feel the vibe of fallout series because everything seems like a comedy colors lights characters dialogues we have lots of blood and violence at the beginning but its not enough to feel the postapocalyptic vibe characters are annoying maybe except for the ghoul hes a badass and the only positive thing about this imo and jokes are lowbrow i dont complain about acting because actors are really good i only complain about poor script and lack of bitter postapocalyptic world sadly we got average comedy rather than fallout
i have never been into gaming and i absolutely love this show bravo falloutthis is the type series you can lose yourself intohas a fast pace  super special effects and a character development that is flawlessim in my mid s and i saw many of my favorite actors from other series i enjoy lost and justified to name a couple so i was really thrilled to see how it was going to develop and wow was i happy i didi seldom leave a review as they want you to write a small book to have it posted to imdb but in this instance i felt that it deserved my timeif youre looking for a fun watch with great special effects then i would recommend this series hands downi was drawn into it immediately after just  episode and it only got better episode after episode
fallout tv show is surprisingly good  a genuinely fun and well told post apocalypse story that doesnt take itself too seriously its got tons of style and is actually very funny had me laughing out loud on a good few occasionsthe story is jam packed with tons of great ideas interesting scifi concepts and corporate  cold war politics a variety of great characters and interesting factions the sets and props and cinematography are fantastic and of course the music is very charming and funso yeah all round a really fun funny and enjoyable rendition of the fallout video game universe i really enjoyed series  and am looking forward to season  i hope the level of quality on display here continues give it a watch 
i have been playing fallout since it started on pc and moved to consoles i love this show people complaining about bad writing either love to complain or have never played the games the plot and writing is just like the games i had to restrain myself from grabbing my controller i hope they do another season there are more easter eggs and nods to the games than i can count it feels like the game it looks like the game and it sounds like the game the show uses most of the music from the games plus some that fits very well i found myself wanting more than the eight episodes we got
as a fan of the games i think its great i also think if your a fan of tv boxsets your in for a treat it does have its flaws its post apocalyptic usa with green trees but who who cares its a good show with great characters i was surprised how they handled ella purnells character she wasnt a girl boss like most shows do now she was awesome as a vault dweller who used her initiative to survive like the game walton goggins stole the show as the ghoul the filli episode was awesome the bos was ok but i cant wait to see what series  brings the vegas strip at the end made me want to start playing new vegas again i thought it was great that the showrunners chose a completely different path to the game good effort and a solid start to a series i hope sticks around for a long time deathclaws are coming
the fallout series triumphantly transitions from game console to television screen masterfully retaining the essence of its source material while introducing an original compelling storyline the shows creators have woven a postapocalyptic tapestry that is as vibrant as it is vast with characters that are as deeply complex as they are endearing throughout the season the narrative keeps you on the edge of your seat with its perfectly paced twists and the clever integration of easter eggs that delight both newcomers and longtime fans of the video gameeach episode feels like a meticulous homage to the beloved franchise yet it stands confidently on its own with a distinct voice and vision the fallout series is not just a nostalgic rehash but a fresh bold exploration of a dystopian world the cliffhangers and the suspenseful finale left me eagerly awaiting the next season this show is a mustwatch for anyone who appreciates rich storytelling and character development wrapped in a thrilling speculative setting
i wanted to say this series far exceeded my expectations though this statement may not be fairwhen they announced this show i was annoyed as i could not picture a world where this show was anything but a terrible low quality poorly written cash grab i loved the games but gaming adaptations basically never workthen the reviews started coming and they were positive okay i thought its probably still average just not the trash everyone feared it would bebut dammit its actually amazing the writing and tone are just perfect the sets and costumes are incredible the cast is awesome and the acting is great ella purnell is especially just so so goodill say it this is the best gaming adaptation better than the last of us whose cinematic game lent itself more easily to an adaptation more than that it is the best show of the year so farbig fan
i dont do reviews but being such a fan of the series since the original fallout game tactics bos all the way through to  the fact they are touching or hinting at touching on one of the best in the series in the next season has so many fan waiting with anticipationso many other game to series have failed but i had to come on and say i love everything about this series while it intriduces a few new elements the nods to everything fallout and even a live vault tec phone number is amazing characters were brilliant casting was wonderful and with each episode i wanted more i got it binged watched the entire season in a day it was so goodi am a fan to be certain but that doesnt detract from the near perfect execution cant wait for more
i am not a fan of this video game or any other this is a dystopian fantasy series and i am a scifi consumer to analyze it from the perspective of the minimum necessary to interest an adult audience is pointless this is a product for uncritical spiritsthere is a lot of blood but the action scenes are poorly choreographed with no sense of pacing or continuity its all just a bunch of gags about exploding heads shattered legs and explosive gunfire but lacking in narrativethe director sorry jonathan has no sense of story flow and splashes fades to black here and there because the script is full of holes and the stories dont string togetherthe plot wanders between supposed comedy and bloody space thriller without deciding on either optionthe premise of the young girl leaving the shelter to find her father who has been kidnapped is as absurd as the very fact that headbusting neanderthals have kidnapped her fathera disappointing failure for adults who love speculative fiction science fiction and dystopias
i am so thrilled this show was as good as it was it nailed almost everything i hoped it would it excells not just as a fallout show but as a series of television by itself just blast from begining to endthey nailed the feel of the games the humourous tone is interwoven with mystery suspense action and character drama the sets are incredible and the world feels so tactile there are clever nods to the games but they never feel like cheap fanservice the original story is simple but very effective it allows first time viewers and fans of the games alike to get attached to the characters and settingin summary its just so easy to like fallout it has a charm unique to the franchise and it feels like every department was working at their a game an incredible achievement in video game adaptations
"even if you have never played any of the games fallout stands as one of the greatest video game adaptions ever put to the small screen
ambitious epic well acted nuanced and hysterically whimsical one of the only shows out that not only respects its source material but also respects an audience who just wants to see something amazingreminiscent of old spaghetti westerns the good the bad and the ugly for example its ambitious in scope while providing a story that isnt complex while making the stakes all the more important a modern sifi masterpiece that will only get better after watching over and over again"

i think at the beginning i should immediately admit that i am not particularly familiar with the legendary computer game but in general terms i had an idea about this universe before watching it i played fallout shelter and the fallout board game but i couldnt even imagine what this project would be aboutfirstly i cant help but note the gorgeous soundtracks that warm the ears and heart excellent musical accompaniment which many have loved since the games the music perfectly emphasizes the atmosphere and relieves stresssecondly it is impossible not to mention the actors who played in this series not super famous but quite talented ella purnell lucy did an excellent job in one of the main roles walton goggins ghoul played a very unusual and interesting role i was very impressed by the image and storyline of his character it was extremely unexpected to see kyle maclachlan hank and its very nice that michael emerson wilzig also appeared and played a small but significant role for the plot his appearance was especially nice because i really liked him after the tv series lostthirdly speaking briefly and about everything at once it is worth noting the cruelty of some scenes the presence of black humor good special effects excellent pacing of the story and plotfourthly apparently something needs to be said about the plot the viewer was provided with several storylines of the main characters which managed to develop well we also have a mystery shrouded in darkness and one goal which is pursued by different characters with their own motives i wont say any details but i managed to watch  episodes in a row in one sitting and got a great impression i expect to continue for another  seasons and will look forward to the continuation of the series and if you like films im very glad that this project did not fail and im sure many will have the same pleasure after watching it as i didfifthly yes there are some questions about the plot and about some of the characters actions but where would we go without that the series is incredible and there is nothing ingenious or inventive here but it is a quality product made to last my respect to the entire film crew out of 
at first i thought it was going to be a goofy show based on a video game and i started watching with low expectations i was pleasantly surprised when i realized this show has an intricate story with great character developmentthe story is interesting and with each episode reveals another layer of this fallout world and makes you want to keep watching i think the cast is fantastic the main girl is my favorite character she does a great job in selling you her rosy point of view on life i really like maximus and the ghoul as well i look forward to learning more about the ghoul and his origins i cant wait for season two
first off the show feels identical to loading up a new fallout game for the first time and playing it except youre not in control the story so far is great with plenty of sub plots to wonder about ive seen alot of hate from hardcore fans most of which is speculation because they feel like the writers arent sticking true to the lore but they havent even given them the chance to finish telling the story they overlook the fact that this show takes place years in the future of the last game in chronological order overall a good show that would make any non fan possibly want to play the games probably the best video game adaptation made
have played all the fallout games many times over my initial thought was it seemed to not be like the video games there was never a case where  vaults are set in such close proximity as in the show but i get this was how they chose to open the story line so overlook that because with vault tec having over  vaults in the us maybe they did have  vaults grouped closely in the la areathe show does a good job of skipping back in time to show how things originated as the series progresses the story keeps your interest ended up binge watching and now my only disappointment is having to wait for a new season but will probably rewatch soon because it really is quite good
as a longtime fan of fallout this was a mere paintjob of fallout over countless modernday ideals that would not exist in such a worldif you were expecting something more like waterworld or mad max solid shows that understood grit in a harsh world from the turn of the century you will be dissapointedthere are no physical requirements for the brotherhood of steel they allow their initiates to have guts in a world of scarcity everything is the modern dei buzz with a coat of paint over it the bones and soul of this world is not fallout its our world with a holographic overlayi dont think writers can even imagine worlds unlike our own anymore unlike the elite tech companies and creative bubbles of the east and west coast over  years of radiation scarcity military cult purity tests ignorance and losswe are still in the modern day with modern messages only an inch beneath the shallow surface of this world
i feel this was a very acceptable adaptation of the fallout universe to tv obviously adapting a rpg to film can be difficult but it was done well i would say if youre one to nitpick lore details you will find issues with the series but if youre not detail oriented or care that jet was found in a sealed vault in fo you will probably enjoy the show the worst part is probably some stiff acting from some secondary characters the leads do well the action is great as well i look forward to seeing the second season im supremely confident that some grips will be addressed and improved on im glad to see this adaptation done well the sets and props look fantastic as well
fallout is a testament to the fact that video game adaptations can indeed deliver mature compelling content on par with acclaimed television series like hbos the last of us another game adaptationthe series has the ability to appeal to both gaming enthusiasts  newcomers alike even if youve never picked up a controller the richly developed characters  intricately woven plotlines will draw you in effortlessly the series doesnt rely solely on its gaming roots to carry it forward instead it stands confidently on its own merits offering a fresh  immersive experience for all viewersthe casting choices are spoton breathing life into characters that fans of the fallout franchise have come to love  new viewers can instantly connect with ella purnells portrayal of lucy maclean is nothing short of captivating bringing depth  resilience to the character as she navigates the harsh realities of the wasteland aaron moten as maximus a squire of the brotherhood of steel delivers a performance filled with both strength  vulnerability showcasing the complexities of survival in a world ravaged by nuclear fallout walton goggins as the ghoulcooper howard is a scenestealer infusing the series with charisma  mystery that would keep viewers on the edge of their seatsits a shining example of how a game adaptation can not only do justice to its source material but also transcend it carving out its own place in the pantheon of great televisionin conclusion if youre looking for a riveting series that seamlessly blends action drama thoughtprovoking themes look no further than amazon primes fallout and as for the next potential game adaptation i couldnt agree more a series based on bioshock would be an absolute dream come true heres hoping that someone out there is listening  ready to bring rapture to life on the small screen
okey dokey where to begin if youre a hardcore fan this will not let you downthis series has definitely been worth the wait and does not fall into the trap of many game adaptions in which they try to take a modern and popular take on the games thereby making them almost unrecognizable from the original mediathe fallout series was clearly made by fans and for fansit has just the right amount of campy cheesy humour along with over the top gore as well as faction wars and involvement to appease even the most diehard of fans with hundreds of easter eggs it has clearly been influenced by all of the fallout genre and not just fo as many fans were afraidso grab a nuka cola assume the position and enjoy
of course i would like to listen more of the s music overall but there are  main stories one about lucy one about howard cooper one about maximus and one about her brother so even every episode is  hour long it isn´t gettijng boring because they can switch between these  stories and all  are very good written i would have like when they would have introduced more side characters but i am happy with the series like it is my personal opinion is that the epised who are made by nolan are even a little more like the game i think because nolan knows the game and he had more recordnicebale music between the other episodes they are only at the beginning and the ending a nice exception is the last episode where the music is fitting but like i said i can recommend this series for everyone
i was sceptical coming into this as a long standing fan its new and interesting having their own standalone adventure rather than trying to recreate any preexisting game everything looks great the first episode sucks you in and makes you want to keep watching all the characters are believable for the world they inhabit the cgi isnt terrible believable brahmin yao guai and power armor show clearly took a lot of visual reference from fallout a fun experience start to finishyou can enjoy this fun romp into the fallout universe regardless of if you have played any games preexisting knowledge not required
very rarely im impressed like this and for sure didnt expect to be with this after not so serious trailer but man oh man i was totally wrong the detailes implemented from the game were so authentic and so vast inumerable acting is superb from all the side roles to the main roles directing is top notch very good plot with great background and little twists especially valut tec background thank you for that i literally did a straight  hours marathon that says it all they really did justice to fallout games and even more cant wait for the next season i hope it stays on same quality level
the series is a technical masterpiece and rich in details capturing the essence of the acclaimed fallout franchise the original soundtrack and classic old songs immerse you in the immensity of the wastes until brutal violence or a dash of dark humor bring you back to the postapocalyptic desolation of the american west the work has incredible photography a captivating story a great plot intertwining the  protagonists and great performances  especially that of the necrotic played by walton goggins war never changes but fallout has just changed the level of video game film adaptations 👍
this shows has very predictable low tier writing and completly retcons the story for an arguably worse version to fit a new vision for the series i wish for a destruction of bethesda offices and for the director to publicly apologise for the mutulation of this series the characters are bland and stale and the plot feels lazy and stretched out this show has no innovation and will not be remembered within next  months this is a massive letdown and has not reached any expectations it has went below them i wish in the future shows such as this are not allowed by law and their creators publicly shamed and inprisoned
"by a selfproclaimed og fan of the series watched it in one day and i can most certainly say it deserves to be canon it has some flaws but would it be fallout if it didnt the acting   the story   the visuals   lore accuracy   fallout feel  i have no idea how any other video game adaptation can top this
stays true to the original while also not forgetting the new onesspoilerswarning for ncr fanboys  its gone reduced to atoms
warning for bos fanboys  they are not the goodytwoshoes like fallout 
warning for vaulttec fanboys  a very very big surprise is waiting for you"
wow what a ride into a dystopian nightmare that is all too beautiful to take your eyes off for even a moment this is what films were meant to be this one happens to be broken out into  episodes even better cannot say enough about the casting actors were fantastic walton goggins just had his greatest performance a cillian murphypeaky blinders type role should receive awards for this the soundtrack the soundtrack haunting dreamlike perfect i have watched many shows in  years i have witnessed all of amazons best i dare say this is amazons finest production of all time watch it now
 the mediocre and bad reviews i doubt they even watched the entire show the reviews are full of cliché wanna be critic buzzwords i would bet they used chatgptthe show is full of wonderful set design hilariously fun violent action and interesting characters great acting great dialogue great directing plus a story that is full of surprises engaging and becomes more and more intriguing as the story moves forwardi never played the game but i knew what it looked like they nailed the look feel and humor its full of great cameos and no one is safei finished it in three days highly recommend
the fallout series is ten times better than the halo series like i love both of the games but the fallout series became more accurate and the storyline was amazing it did gave me a mad max saga vibe but this show definitely needs a season  to continue the story i knew i be hooked to this show when i saw the teaser happy that they finally made a show about this gameit does make me wanting to play all of the fallout games again honestly recommended to give this show a shot yall wouldnt be disappointed especially if yall like the fallout game as wellhope season  comes soon
this is great so far i love how it incorporates the game i played ipad very creative and catches my interest i only have one issue so far and thats lucy leaving the vault this chick has been underground her entire life she leaves and has absolutely no noticeable astonishment or reaction to sand trees sky wind ocean etc maybe im being picky but after  years underground weird maybe if they had scripted some excitement or reaction her journey outside would be a little more monumental im also trying to figure out why all these people living above ground dont seem to have mutations otherwise really enjoying the show and will certainly keep watching it sometimes you just have to go with the flow
i was a huge fan of the fallout  and  video games i also loved the later games although the gloominess made the them difficult for me to play for extended periods while i dont remember a lot of the details of the games this series felt like a spoton adaptation of the spirit and aesthetics of the gamesthe production quality is first rate the acting writing sets and visual effects are superb one thing i loved in particular is how they solved the problem i had with the later fallout games breaking up the gloom they did this by alternating between gloomy scenes and vibrant ones not only did this make the gloom manageable it helped to emphasize the contrast among the different worlds very well done
masterpiece dont miss it i give solid  background song music awesomethe background music top notch and best game adaptionthe dilogue okiea docky really loved the diloguescreen playworld exploration people mind set wasteland experience everything is awesome perfect web seriesiam really loved the heroine character she such a beautiful women her expression loveablecharacter developement good first time i see no negatives have this seariseghoul character design really good more important given the searise comparatively protagonisti am started watching second time the searisereagionl language dubbing also awesome the local bad words really enjoyable 😂
fallout is based on a video game that i have not played and know nothing about so i am probably not the target audience for this show however i do like scifi and the premises sounded interesting and it is taking place in a postapocalyptic worldthe show is decently done and visually it looks good the budget must be substantial the acting is decent and the show is a mixture of three themes the s cowboys and futureesque it is interesting to see these mixed together but at the same time they dont really properly mix but just coexist mostly separatelythe storytelling is very much from the school of video games in the way that the characters are sort of introduced separately then a lot of information is listed and then they go on a quest it didnt particularly appeal to me nor capture my attention as a person who does not play a lot of video games though the last of us was able to do this very successfully for nongamers in my opinionthe characters are flat the main character lucy is kind of annoying and unrelatable with her completely unrealistic naivite and blind optimism she doesnt really feel like a whole character but just some form of male fantasy maximus is even worse hes so flat and without any character trades that he doesnt even manage to be annoying the ghoul has charisma and is interesting but doesnt get enough screentime to hold up the show on his ownthere are no interpersonal relationships formed really in the first episodes of the show its just three separate characters occasionally meeting but mostly just interacting and fighting with various npcs which is very boring to me as a nongamer so it is very difficult to keep the attentionfinally for me the absolute worst part is the soundtrack it feels very forced deliberate and pretencious s songs are forced onto scenes where most of the time they make no sense preventing me from falling into the story then the songs suddenly stop and the feel of the scene instantly changes because it never fitted with the s music to begin with making the storytelling very discontinuous especially in relation to the feel of the story and emotions conveyed in each scenes the futureesque music that is used for fighting scenes and exciting storypoints is very slow and depressing and does the opposite of making me engaged in this story so overall the soundtrack is just very annoying andor boring to me overbearing to the point that it rips my attention away from the story an exception of this is johnny cash obviously as johnny cash is almost always a good choice from what i hear though this is a fundamental part of the falloutverse and the music has so much of a presence and its own character peraps too independent from the tv show that i am sure some people will love iti admit this is written after only watching three episodes so maybe it does get better i just cant watch more of this show to find outoverall this is not a bad show it was just not for me which is ok and is probably more catered to fans of fallout and video games in general
never played the game so knew nothing about this show watched it in  days gripped from the first episode to the last if i hadnt have had to sleep i would have done it in  sittingthe story is outstanding the actors are pitch perfect and the production is better than anything i have seen in a very long timei usually avoid shows with graphic violence and horror but this was not gratuitous but rather something that pushed the story forwardthis is my first review of any show and it was so good that i am actually taking the time to write thismoremore and more pleasei hope season  will keep up the amazing work
best j nolan work since westworld s and those are some big words havent played the games myself but the world building here is top notch everything feels real in its own way and all the pieces start piecing together with the right tempoif i had to say one thing the first few episodes are quite slow they have something but the fall short compared to the rest but hey better to have some slow first episodes than bad last oneson the acting side of things the ghoul is one of the best ive seen this year both in the flashbacks and ghouls scenes theres no character that feels out a must watch for sure
i usually dont leave reviews but this show really deserves it this is the only adaptation of a video game that actually did it right and preserved the games feel i appreciate that they didnt just took the storyline from one of the games but made their own main plot within the universe of fallout if you played the games you will feel that the show fits right in and could easily be an expansion and unlike some other bookgame adaptations if you didnt play the games it is still quite clear to understand what is going onthe acting was great i feel like most of the charachters would fit perfectly within the game world there is quite a lot of game anecdotes within the show just enough to bring the feeling of nostalgia so all in all 
its as if all the best parts of the last of us the witcher and westworld got together and made a super baby that i could not stop watching i couldnt find a single thing negative to say about this show if i tried walton goggins absolutely killed it in this and all the main cast just blew me away awesome writing awesome acting awesome cinematography and awesome directing tend to make for an awesome show and fallout certainly did not disappoint so if you havent seen it please do yourself a huge favor and give it a watch youd be doing yourself a disservice if you miss this one phenomenal show
like most of the series nowadays the script is bland and full of cliches like the fact that there is an army that somehow moves huge airships with little explanation on how they get the fuel or ressources the characters always find their way into each other by coincidence with little to no explanation to how they did lots of plot holes and things that dont make sense the story is too silly at times and undercooked i dont mind the violence but at times it feels too gratuitous i will say that the visuals and the music and cinematic artistry is triple a quality i still had a great time watching it but the story is underwhelming at best regardless the show all around is high quality and tight technically
"for these days  age its a perfect show full episodes with no fillers great choice of music with s oldies giving the atmosphere with every scene is interesting contributing to the general plot  feel of the showthe main characters are all good gogginsas always is spectacularwatch for those justified cameos from a few boyds friends
i hadnt played the game but i can sure feel the vibe the game gives to the show as a post apocalyptic agesame as a lot of those shows theres a few flashback scenes but in the show there all great  mysteriouswell done amazon for this i think it may better than the last of us"
before i watched it  i thought it will be a shallow and just a casual low budget series that is made to promote the games as someone who played all of its games even though they are good i believe its very hard to turn that universe to cinema they did not just nail it but this is seriously the best prime video exclusive series of all time after their ridiculous lord of the rings and wheel of times adaptations im glad that this turned out to be very wellall episodes are full with misteries and it never let viewer get bored characters are hard to relate at first but it you connect them very fast as you keep watching
this series plays like the classic postapocalyptic story a boy and his dog only in reverse at some point the trope of subterranean bourgeois overlords in an irradiated wasteland populated by mutants became twisted by the legacy of that successful story into what we see today the journey from there to here would be an interesting subject to discuss at greater length suffice it to say that this series is several steps back in a few different directions at the same time without being in any way offensive to aficionados of the genrea few creative choices that may have been technical difficulties mar this production repeatedly there are shots taken with what must be a wideangle lens that fail to find any focus on their subject the entire screen remains in a blurry unfocused haze despite a wellframed and obvious subject this may have something to do with the cameras used to film series like this since the same thing happens in shogunalthough in shogun it happens often enough to acquire some arguable significance here it just seems incredibly lazy i assume that lobbyists from the wideangle lens industry would only let management let up in last years strikes on the condition that more of their products be forced upon people who dont know or care about their effective useaside from these brief moments of wtf this show looks almost perfect with a darker filter and more emphasis on violence this could be a  unfortunately it takes the road more often traveled of pulling punches in a world defined by brutality i guess i just want rob zombies fallout presented by eli roth this is fine until thenedit i added  stars when i saw just how many people are dogwhistling to their fellow fascists in the reviews here congratulations guys you found another dumb thing to be offended over what next youll say that the xmen arent a metaphor
gone are the days of uwe bollthe recent adaptation of the last of us is the gold standard against which all game adaptations will be measured and while there are many out there its generally the animestyle the gather appreciation since the animated genre is more malleable to provide the kind of elements generally required while liveaction lives and dies on the strength of the story characters and actingfallout shines in the direction department jonathan nolan and lisa joy join forced with bethesda game designer todd howard nolans name alone would gather respect but next to a bethesda game designer the hopes from this adaptation are high and it doesnt disappointthe story draws on all the right elements of the franchise and builds deeply within the postapocalyptic fallout world the story is really well thought out and brings enough background that the detailedoriented viewers who havent enjoyed the games also have a good shot at immersing themselves in the storythe only thing that feels shaky is the acting its not consistent all around and while overall the cast does a good job its not just that obviously some actors do a better job than others its also that nobody is consistent in their craftits a fairly minor issue but i can see the potential for it to get tiresome overall though its an amazing series that makes the subscription to prime video worth it all by itself
not a fallout player i dont care for the game this is a tv series ruined by the soundtrack this series isnt a disaster dont get me wrong i recognize the value and greatness of oldies music but people who like this kind of music dont share a taste for splatter gore there are things that just dont add up and this is one of them the show is aimed at the present generation who as much as they appreciate the oldies they have their different tastes above them at least i find the music to be boring strident and out of place apart from having to lower the volume every time the music is presented resulting in noise something that is not fair its a misuse of something as valuable as the music of bygone good all timesi like the westernstyle narrative the story is fine and many elements of dark humor and horrific scenes some episodes that lack substance can be annoying at times and there comes the happy everything is gone be all right music again and again and again i have been following jonathan nolan since his brother sir christopher nolan adapted jonathans short story memento mori into the film memento  also favorites like person of interest the dark knight interstellar and westworld from the latter seems to come the character of walton goggins as the ghoul if it hadnt been for the inconvenience of the soundtrack i would have given it a  for the excellent cinematography but there is an  for every time i have to mute it in each episode
as a gamer i was very excited to see how this adaptation would be to watch however i wasnt too skeptical and afraid the show would be bad when i saw that jonathan and lisa were involved i have  hours in fallout new vegas best fallout game in my opinion and  hours in fallout  so to see that they have done so fantastic job of taking the things from the games and making them an exact copy was just awesome i will probably get back into a new game of new vegas soon😂 the story is of course not from the games but i think that is a good idea to get a completely new story in this universe is great i like that they have backstories for the characters and that we got some answers on who started it all the ending of episode  well i got goosebumps and a big smile on my face👍 cant wait for season  and hopefully even more seasons😁
fallout the tv series is like diving headfirst into a postapocalyptic buffet of entertainment with more twists than a mutant radscorpions tail and characters as colorful as a vaulttec jumpsuit this show is a nuclear blast of fun from the witty dialogue to the explosive action scenes its like finding a stash of bottle caps in a deserted wastelandunexpectedly delightful so grab your pipboy settle into your favorite nukacola chair and prepare for a bingewatch experience thats more addictive than jetfallout the tv series is like finding a stash of perfectly preserved prewar snacks in a postapocalyptic wastelandunexpectedly delightful the shows mix of retrofuturistic charm quirky characters and radioactive drama will have you glued to your screen faster than you can say nukacola its a blast from the past with a radioactive twist that will leave you craving for more
ive played all the fallout games including its predecessor wasteland and this show almost brings a tear to this old gamers eyes a faithful adaption in everyway bundled with an interesting story filled with intrigue all the characters are flawed on various levels but youd expect that in a postapocalyptic world no one is really likeable but they are at least relatable as they each show us what could be the ugliest parts of ourselvesthe set pieces are top notch and oftentimes look just like the games they spared no expense here actors were cast well and it was good to see some old names like ponch from chips make an appearancewe dont get shows this good often which is a shame and when we do we feel spoiled hopefully this isnt a one hit wonder and the next season if there is one will be just as good
name a game or book adaptation that followed you cant so dont hate on this for being a little off creative direction can make a story better than the game it can also be the oppositewhen it comes to this the visuals are amazing and on par with the games the acting is good to awesome nothing too horrible on delivery the game match story match upwell it is lacking details for the game enthusiasts it is worth your time even if you are not a fan of the games or game storylines in general plenty of action twists dystopia themes and drama romance and a pinch of humori have played the games i appreciate the production team for making this the best video game adaptation i have seen to date thank you for delivering quality entertainment that can be enjoyed by nongamers and gamers alikekeep up the good work and looking forward to season 
having never played the game i am scoring and reviewing this solely on the merits of the tv show and compared to other shows for example halo into the badlands shadows and bones it tries too hard to look and feel dystopian to maintain suspension of disbeliefevery opportunity is used to play some old ss music could not more feel like someone got a free jukebox and insists that it be used in every scene even when the music has zero bearing on the scenes and does nothing to evoke the feelings the director undoubtedly intended to invokei might give it a chance to see how it develops but based on just the first two episodes its a hard storyline to follow and any and all cohesion between the different storylines to allow nonfalloutgamers to get seemed to have gotten lost in translation with too much time spent on trying to force feed you the rather poorly presented misery of the world instead of using that time to let the dystopianness reveal itself through solid storytelling
this is an amazing tv show whether you played the games or not immaculate casting led to incredible performances backed up by an excellent script and spoton pacing cherry on top is the production level which is through the roofjust like the last of us this also captures the essence of the original material while also making it work flawlessly in a different medium but again just like in tlou you dont need to have played the games to appreciate the immense effort and quality behind this tv show because it stands on its own as a genuine work of art that will value every moment of your time you choose to dedicate to it highly recommended
as a dinosaur fallout gamer who spent almost  decades playing nearly every game in this universe i am very much pleased with this adaptation the producers showed utmost respect to us gamers including even the tiniest details from the game universe which is quite a challenging task considering a vast gaming universe and endless loreacting scenario cgi soundtrack and everything else i can think of are top notch in this show this show expands the fallout canon beyond fallout  which makes it an essential part of the canon and a must see for all fallout gamers as for the rest who are not familiar with the game its a great way to enter the fallout universe and considering how well the scenario is written im sure they wont be disappointed as wellafter an intense binge watching im already waiting eagerly for the second season kudos to the entire fallout team
ive played all the fallout games and have thousands of hours between nv and  when the show was first announced i rolled my eyes i didnt think it would do the games justice or respect it but then i saw who was writing it and who was acting in it walton goggins so fast forward a couple days agothe show has great writing acting and directing the characters are engaging and likeable maximus lucy the ghoul the setting and its visuals are extremely faithful and accurate to the games at a certain point i almost took a screenshot because i thought i was playing a fallout gamethe show is closer to   and new vegas because of where it is set i badly felt like replaying new vegas while watching the show im one of the biggest fanboys of that game youll find where it mixes in the modern games is the look of the vaults the terminal ui and the general look of buildinghouse interiorsthis show has better writing than any of the recent modern fallout games it simply does as far main stories and side quests go  things i ignore in favor of exploring and discovering the stories in the environmentwhat the show does better than the games is the depiction of ghouls things id just make swiss cheese instead of giving a second thought but in the show they show how dark and sad it is when ghouls are about to go feral they were truly scarybos is actually menacing and dark compared to the games knights wearing power armor have an ominous and awesome presence in the beginning it reminded me of the sith in star wars take the armor off and maybe things arent what they seem in the games they are very very boring and mediocre save for some personalities here and therethe vault story was told just as excellently as the games many vaultsthe intro of the show is better than the intro of any game besides new vegas intro which is badass for which it probably goes side to side with itwalton goggins character is incredible even in the prewar hes one of the best actors of all time i know this from having watched justified  times or moremy only criticism or thing i would change in the show is how a certain city came to its ruin it could have come to ruin in a more better written more respectable way but i suppose a lot of things happen in the games that arent exactly described as respectfulyou dont need to play the games to enjoy the show but you will get far more enjoyment if you have played all of them especially   and nv you get the references know all the enemies yao guai gulper feral ghouls etc recognize the propganda i like looking at items in the games so i felt rewarded when i recognized the salty prospector saloons beans in the showits the attention to detail that make fallout greati like that the show is canon because its the closest thing well get to a new vegas sequel but hopefully the next game can also go back to the west coast and we can explore what the show left us

lets do a review of a tv show give me an engaging title at the top first off this series is  episodes and i really wanted it to go for another two or so the cons were the clearly forced mixed race couple unnecessary lesbian relationship and a knock off of john boyega from star wars which seemed contrived once again the pros were that i loved the storyline alternative usa history political satire albeit i missed the horses from the video game  im told mutant horses would consume enormous special effects costs so theyre skipped in this series the protagonist is a female vault dweller whos dad gets kidnapped and she goes off to rescue him production was top quality sets etc actors also were great walton goggins shines as the ghoul and was a perfect match for the roletv series review fallout  a captivating journey through an alternate postapocalyptic americathe highly anticipated fallout tv series based on the popular video game franchise has finally arrived while the shows eightepisode run left fans craving more it managed to deliver a compelling narrative impressive production values and outstanding performancesone of the series greatest strengths lies in its engaging storyline which follows a female vault dweller on a mission to rescue her kidnapped father the shows writers have done an excellent job of adapting the games lore and creating a fresh yet familiar narrative that keeps viewers hooked the alternative history of the united states combined with clever political satire adds depth to the worldbuilding and provides a thoughtprovoking backdrop for the characters adventureshowever the show is not without its flaws some viewers may find the inclusion of a mixedrace couple and a lesbian relationship to be forced and unnecessary while representation is important these elements can sometimes feel like they were added to check boxes rather than serving the story organically additionally the presence of a character who bears a striking resemblance to john boyega from the star wars franchise may come across as contrived to somedespite these minor drawbacks fallout excels in its production quality the sets costumes and visual effects are topnotch immersing the audience in the postapocalyptic world while fans of the video game may miss the presence of mutant horses the decision to omit them due to high special effects costs is understandablethe acting in the series is another highlight with the cast delivering strong performances across the board walton goggins in particular shines as the ghoul character bringing the perfect blend of humor grit and humanity to the role his portrayal is a testament to the shows casting directors who have assembled a talented ensemble to bring the fallout universe to lifein conclusion fallout is a mustwatch for fans of the video game series and newcomers alike while it may have its shortcomings the shows engaging storyline impressive production values and outstanding performances more than make up for them as viewers eagerly await news of a potential second season they can revel in the fact that the fallout tv series has successfully captured the essence of the beloved franchise"
from the get go this is the fallout i loved playing as a kid its fun and stays true to the random and obscure events that happen in the game  i think the writers have done a great job of creating a story worthy of the fallout series i for one cannot wait for the next seasonthe acting is great and i think the casting is spot on  especially cooper walton who really nails the role to a t and i am exited to see what s has in store hopefully more of the samei am not well versed on the aspects of film making but i thought the cinematography was very well done especially in the final episodesi may be bias but my favourite parts were seeing the brotherhood in action and the flashback revelations
i havent played the games so i might be highly critical on its accuracy however as a general viewer this was a refreshing unique and excellent tv show for a changethe shows keeps you engaged by simply not revealing too much too quick the story is well paced across its run time with a good character arc that builds up evenly between its charactersin addition also loved the fact that each characters discovery helps reveal the hidden gems of the plot with a catchy conclusion to the finale of season  i personally cant wait for season i am more than happy to recommend this tv show to anyone and if you reading this review its worth giving this show a try
absolutely loved it great adaptation with enough throwbacks to the games to keep me interested cant wait for season  the action was great the ghoul was an awesome character that you would find loving and hating at the same time lucy was an interesting character and maximus added good humor the rich vault tech history made it interesting and the plot twists are there to keep you wanting to watch throughly enjoyed this adaptation some minor issues are easily overlooked with well written story and phenomenal acting of the main characters wish tv shows still ran  episodes a season only downside is waiting for season 
i used to watch my son play the game and it seemed quite entertaining i love quirky movies and television shows that most people do not enjoy i fell asleep three times in two nights watching this program i kept trying on night three but it hasnt kept my interest im supposed to write six hundred characters but i dont find the need to denigrate any this tv show the fallout tv show was just not my cup of tea enjoy it if you wish i just found it flat and boring i guess ive never made a review before because i find this character limit absolutely pointless too i guess this is my last review
as a lover of the games i was hesitant about this series but it doesnt disappoint absoloutely worth the watch for lovers of the game and those who never played it alike it covers all details both pre and post the bombs falling which allows the viewers to understand the history of the games but enjoy the series without having played a single minute of the game weather a fusion core or bottle caps are your choice a trade is worth it to watch this series and eagerly await the nd series when we this will be enjoy the eliquor grab a stimpak avoid the jet and settle in for the lessons of a lifetime after the bombs fall
this is seriously good the world is true to the original a non blacknwhite fallout mess we all love its funny its grim but it also adds more to the original games story which is good this is actually in my opinion why some fans dont like it because it adds to the original stories and thats why its good in my humble opinionin addition the visuals are great quite true to bethesda games rather than original  and actors are doing a great work and the character development keeps you involved with actual charactersif i would be asked whats bad about it maybe it could be more dark humor in it like killing kids as in the original but hey its  and we are living in a softer world the authors still got a pregnant woman shooting machine gun its somethinggo watch it youll love it meanwhile im going to play fallout  for th time
i really enjoyed season  i found it to be such a fun watch everything just felt entertaining and i was left wanting more after each episode you bet ill be faithfully waiting for the next season and just excited for future easter eggs and new places the songs at the end of each episode was a great touch while you look at the art of the show and games everyone casted has been great they just all seem to fit in perfectly great set design and a great adaptation of the games the costumes look great the makeup and effects perfect i cant wait to see what other great stuff comes from this series
ive been trying to write this for days but now that im supposed to be preparing for my exam tomorrow i felt it was about the right timewhen i first saw the trailer back in december knowing that one of the nolans was making the series i was almost certain it would be awesome at least i was hoping and luckily my expectations were metthe last of us lost the battle for me last of us hasnt been in the number  spot on the best game adaptation podium as much as it has been for most of the audience but fallout has definitely knocked it off the top spot everyone was amazed at how good the last of us was as a video game adaptation but i wasnt impressed i found it pretty average i didnt feel it was much more better than the walking dead  seasons even if it wasnt about zombiesthe stories and subplots of the fallout are well suited to presenting a post apocalyptic world normally i dont tend to be particularly interested in anything visual stunning because it can age badly over the years but it has to be said this world created is really visually stuning beautiful and well constructed the s sets and soundtrack are stunning reminding me of the series lost where the songs downtown or make your own kind of music are played when they hit the cliffhanger the characters are alive the black humour is sufficient and fineabout naive lucy ella purnell sometimes its hard to decide whether shes funny or annoying but ill stick with funny shes a welldeveloped character really like someone who has grown up in a shell and is now confronted with the horrors of the world that the world is a dark and full of terrorsthe actor who played maximus aaron moten unfortunately didnt show his acting talent during the  episodes somehow i didnt like his character so much he is less developed not as well as the other charactersobviously in the series its walton goggins playing the cooper howardghoult character who totally steals the show its hard to decide if hes a hero antihero or a villain the flashbacks are very fasinating and the way we learn more and more of his backstory from his past is well dosed reaching the catharsis and necessary cliffhanger in the last episode which makes us look forward to the next season of the series an another nolan quote that has already come to mind is you either die a hero or live long enough to become the villainas a big twin peaks and dune lynch fan i was very pleased with kyle maclachlans performance especially the dale cooper thumbs up from arrakis to the wastelandlets hope that the next seasons of the series do not go the way of the witcher series
the trailers gave me hope but actually watching the series it was felt like another quest well done it really felt like i was in the wastelands trying to make make sense of of what is happening the series had some of its own ideas in making the story work but it actually made sense and worked i really liked the main characters  especially the the way they acted and the choices that they made the first time you play a fallout game  you try to be as good as you can but players will know that doesnt last long and thats what makes it interesting it makes you think it makes you choose i hope that people will give this show a shot because it was all i could hope it would be
this show sets the bar for what gamers want to see in a show about their favorite gamefallout has been stunning to look at the story is constantly intriguing the characters are complex and developed theyve kept the lore of the previous games without taking liberties with themthere are some important and iconic fallout beasts and weapons that do not make an appearance but i feel confident those will appear in later seasonsfallout is something i am going to watch a dozen times between season  and season  which i suspect will come out in  if they follow true bethesda lore and only release a new gameseason every  years
based on a video game never would have guessed this seems exactly like the kind of clever noise a few dozen upandcoming tv producers at amazon might come up with when their job is on the line bring me something violent and fun that will cost a lot of money and grab the attention of the unwashed masses preferably the unwashed gamer masses something like last of us but with zingers oneliners and more explosions maybe some cgi bugs a cute girl or two and how about a semifamous costar who always plays the semifamous costar make sure theres at least one lowly underdog we can hire a minority actor for but make them comedy relief with a heart robots and zombies if possibleif it were any fun at all fallout would be a lowstakes delight beautiful production design and game actors a pedigree and a budget but its all so instantly dumb badly written choppy and nonsensical fallouts attention span is shorter than the ads that precede it action comedy is hard to land both have to be tight  the filmmakers have to establish tone fallout insists on being taken seriously all the while slapping the audience with vaudevillelevel pratfalls and gags its more fun watching reallife fail vids than a team of artists trying to recreate them
"as a dedicated fallout fan as myself i would like to tell a story about how i encountered with this wonderfull fallout world in first place  when i was a kid back then my brother and i ve one shared computer soo we played in turns  soo in those not my turn times i was soo excited to wait my turn to play  soo while i waiting  i sometimes visit my uncles house which his house was near to my family house  my cousin who is couple of years older than me plays with his computer  i watched him or sometimes he let me to play it some of his games  i first experienced games like monkey island   might and magic   need for speed  and also he had previous gaming console which he had have amiga gaming console back then so i played street fighter   lotus racing game and soo many other kinds of arcade games with his machines then one day  i saw him to play one particular game the year was  i think  the game itself has soo many features and soo enriched in materials that game amazed me back then and still it is  this game name was fallout   it has well written dialogs and options that youve deciding into and leads to you the way that how you would like to go on it was up to your decisions  first time i saw its character creation sheet  i simply amazed in its wonderful features in it there is a pointing system that  there is some limitations so you decide that what kind of character you would like to dive into this world  game itself giving you this option is up to your desire  you can choose to be play as dumbest person and still finish the game and play as intelligent person and still finish the game its up to you that what kind of gaming style you would like to play  and also its features mostly based on text dialogs back then helped my to develop my english skills  i ve had a story that when i was in middle school  our english teacher asked us  how to say buy in english  i responded her to say  its barter d  well technically it goes into same direction but not as expected as the teacher thought  but still she was amazed that how this child knows to word barter but not knows the word buy  thats the one of the story ive on fallout can continue with soo many others  this game broadened my horizon  gave me soo many other point of views to look into my upcoming events in my life  the game itself has a incredible deep story about what could be happen if there
would be global nuclear war happens all around the world and what would be the outcome if such thing happens  of course it has soo many fictional things happens but its main idea is simple  the biggest weapon on humanity have is nuclear weapons right now and this weapon could lead back to humanity  its stil is one of the biggest threat for our earth and this game tells a story about that i wouldnt like to give more detailed information about fallout universe but the thing is i expected from this tv series is give the general idea of this universe and gives some of the fundamentals of
this universe  its still giving some information but there are some minor details like if the tv series could explained it  it would attract more people rather than only get attention of fallout fanssome of them like the people aint have any idea about fallout universe might not know that why the people lives like s style in s  why the computerized systems soo bulky  what was the enemy of the united states  who the hell was this reds  communists  is this tv series is refering into  those kind of minor things could give more relief to the viewers  that those are first time experiencing this universe but on other hand as a fallout fan as myself its a almost  tv series soo far but realistically cause of these minor things it goes down a little bit into   and there is also one other thing which is i believe to mentioned it  the story itself in tv series built in  epic story which i think that  with that story  the story is now focused on hope rather than it suppose to explain it the total desperation of humanity  now with that story weve known of  we know that if this thing the tv series is mentioned somehow might be happen in a right way  most of the problems of the humanity would resolve  i hope that the writers of this tv series find a way about to continue on this tv series as much hyped as possible  this fallout universe is the best fictional universe in my life  i hope that this tv series represent it well  in my personal thoughts i liked it soo far  thanks again for everyone for their contributions on this wonderfull project i would like to first thank tim cain  brian fargo  leonard boyarsky  chris taylor  feargus urquhart  chris avellone  mark morgan  todd howard and soo many other wonderfull developers  artists and other members to make this universe special i would like to thank each member of this tv series  that those people represent this universe as accurate as possible "
this show is amazing if you are open to it and let it keep entertaining you i do like the world of fallout and its setting and honestly they couldnt have done it any better every show considering its setting has its maximum potential and its amazing to see what theyve done here give it a chance likeable and diverse characters great acting jawdropping setpieces and an attention to detail you wont see so often you can tell this has been done by experienced and forward thinking directors i am very much in hope for season  and i think for sure this will get another season or two well done 
this show is interesting outstanding acting the visuals are awesome reminds me a little of silo and the pacing is nicefor me the only thing i dont like that i think devalues everything is the humor the humor is stupid and absurd it makes everything less dramatic less serious less intense i was hoping for this show to be more scary dark and intense like the last of us the stupidity the humor brings just really puts me off it feels like it ruins the execution of the scenes and plot its like they are making fun of themselves its a little exhausting to watch other than that i think its another excellent video game adaptationside note yes i have played the games favorites of mine and no i dont think the humor in the show is the same humor in the games the games felt more serious to me but thats just my experienceall in all you dont want to miss this one
let me start by saying lore is wrong blah blah blah who cares this series is so lovingly crafted by individuals who quite obviously cherish the fallout universe if you are seeing negative reviews over false lore do yourself a favor and ignore every wordive grown up on these games and was super apprehensive about the series being a flop this is a better adaption than i could have ever hoped for its a perfect balance of drama silliness and mindless brutal violence the  main characters are all brilliant but lucy is a different level the vault dwelling newbie to the wasteland adds such fun element to the series its as if i was watching a friend play the games for the first timeperfection go watch now
cant say enough great things about this show and other reviewers have stated the obvious but no one mentions the blasting god awful music that is playing whenever the scenes switch to the vault or lucys character often the music overrides the dialogue and lasts the duration of the song seriously there is absolutely no connection of the music with the scenes i get that the director wants to imply a long past era of when the vault was set up but that would be the early atomic age of the late s and early s sorry the music doesnt fit as most of the soundtrack dates from s to early s and is screeching too loud this works for boardwalk empire but not this show one can only guess that the producers went on the cheap and acquired free music that is part of the public domain rather than pony up and purchase some of the outstanding music of the correct time period
from video games to liveaction tv series in video games fallout allowing me to explore postapocalyptic landscapes and engage in captivating narratives these gaming sessions on the back day became cherished memories of my childhood as i navigated through the unique worlds presented in each installment of the fallout franchise the franchise underwent a notable transformation transitioning from its roots as a turnbased tactical rpg to a firstperson shooter open world rpg  the games feature a protagonist navigating a postapocalyptic world facing challenges to survivefallout universe encapsulates everything i adore  classic radio podcast s music on a pipboy encounters with random npcs providing quests desertpatrolling robots radiationresistant power armor lurking feral ghouls super mutants raiders various bizarre mutant creatures upgradable weapon and leveling up some skills perks theyre also multiple factions in fallout you can join or refuse playing the game mirrors the experience of watching a scifi bmoviethe fallout tv series continues from fallout  but its more like a spinoff story some includes references from previous titles in the fallout franchise featuring three main characters lucy the vault dweller maximus the brotherhood of steel and the ghouls along with cx each the character has their own story before and after the nuclear disaster strike everything in this tv series captures vibes similar to the video game with outstanding cinematography showcasing the haunting beauty of apocalyptic los angeles in every location the story so far has been amazing and enjoyable to watch especially with its inclusion of dark comedy executed skillfully akin to the humor seen in fallout franchise
adapting a video game is always tough but this series does it very well every scene looks amazing and seemingly stays true to the spirit of the gamethe first episode had me hooked lucy and ghoul introduced both great characters and the action after the wedding was awesome and thenevery scene in the vault was absolutely dreadful to get through once lucy leaves it watching freakin rico from hannah montana suspiciously and somberly walk around for  episodes was ridiculous the humor from lucys cousin  other leaders of the vault was awfulfinn i mean maximus was unbearably boring of a character they really forced a love connection between him and lucy and really just copied finns story from star warsscenes just went on way too long every flashback with walton coggins and his wife was just too long and rather boring the reveal that lucys dad was actually bad was very bad the acting from lucy was great but i really dont need  full mins of her sad face reacting to the news and her dad pleading in the cage that it wasnt truethe cameos just seemed mid as well why have fred armisen and not do anything funny in his scene matt berry could have been utilized better tooidk it just really annoyed me more than i enjoyed it giving it props for looking so good though and really enjoyed lucy as a character  the actress walton coggins of course always killing itif this tells me one thing bioshock series needs to happen
some of the symbolism in this story is brilliant the expansion of human nature into the grim and violent portrayals in characters we all know deep down how many of us would be killers  how many cowards and the bunker society is wonderful the naivity  the innocence and the denial so accurate the cowboy zombie fighting to keep his humanity and the mutant gulpers just great ideas im not a gamer and just watched this for entertainment and was gripped from the first minute to the last i might have ot try the game now please do a season twoi also really enjoyed the way the dog touched the human inside the goul flashbacks which can be so annoying or spoiling where not  they are just right giving the back story jas needed
the good the acting was solid the sets pull you in in a few of the scenes i could taste the dust and grime if you didnt know the lore the characters are able to fill you in without that annoying info dump thats so prevalent in film  tv these days the series adds to the lore of the games  has a few surprises for fans im not a fan of easter eggs being shoved in but the eggs on the show felt natural and not shoved in for memberberry bait like ready player nostalgia lucy is a decent fishoutofwater and not just a girl boss cooper howardthe ghoul has a lot of charismathe bad my opinion of maximus is mixed he came off as either insufferable or compelling hes definitely an upgrade from star wars finn the romance between lucy  maximus seems forced the humor is a bit cringe worthy at times but tolerablethe ugly id recommend this series keep in mind that the series central theme is nothing is as it seems
whether you play the games or not you can still walk away loving the show the aesthetics the lore the easter eggs and nods all just combine into an awesome show loved every second and couldnt wait to get right into the next episode each timethe first episode made my jaw drop half way through and i had to text some buddies to get them to watch too it was funny and tense the whole timei can honestly say i was disappointed that there were only  episodes i hope they come out with many more and if they do im excited to see where the series goes from herecooper is definitely my favorite character alongside dogmeat i cant wait for more
this one did for sure couldnt wait for the next episode played almost all the games in the last  year and was quite impressed with acting and storyline well done and awesome actors i feel the directors made a great depiction of the fallout word and the transitions between story lines appropriately some scenes seem a little drawn out and need more backstories i imagine this is the goal seeming vague is merely the story unfolding i really hope this series keeps moving forward and continues its unique and dark tone regardless i will be watching every episode on season  and forward fallout
excellent writing the different bits and pieces were connected to bring a satisfying ending very good character development mystery etc to be honest i didnt have high expectations but i felt a deep respect for the game its a wonderful dramaalso the motivations andor the situations of the various characters can be quite complicated definitely a very wellmade adaption with a great cast entire cast felt on point suitable amount of humor at the right moments gory and violent as hell intriguing storyline and so many fun easter eggs for fans they understood the assignmenti wasnt a fan of the ending but i enjoyed it overall
so glad they didnt go a bloodless disney route and stayed true to the game i played probably  hours of fallout  but even a person with  hours would love this and i love that it was dropped all at once binge weekend yeehawthe costumes the language the weirdness the culture many elements of this game were brought to the screen beautifully i so wish they make a fallout  but i fear i will not have the time like i did before truth is i play games now wishing they had a survivor mode okay im just filling in characters to get to the  minimum now almost there enjoy the show
everything from the set design costumes characters and story was chefs kiss it honestly felt like the actual game im hoping in future seasons well see more of the various factions and monsters throughout the wasteland was hoping to see a deathclaw or two also since this is about  years after fallout  the potential to hear about or see characters from it is hugemy only issue with the show and its teeny tiny is they never actually explained how moldova came to be in the future as it doesnt seem like she was associated with vaulttech and she is about the same age she was in  maybe i missed that part im not sure
the show was everything i hoped it wouldnt be the tone is too light the writing is predictable the characters are bland the world is too clean etc i know a lot of passionate people put a lot into this but it just feels like the only fallout they played was  i really wish i could like this show but honestly cant recommend it with its by the numbers writing style and tone deaf approach to a beloved seriesi really was hoping theyd capture what made    and new vegas great the soul crushing wasteland and atmosphere is not there its a comedy with some light drama thrown in at the end of the day
you dont need to have payed the games or really know anything about them the only thing game knowledge adds are some dang thats from the game so cool moments playing the game only adds to the experience but not knowing the games doesnt take anything away from the overall entertainment and quality fallout stands on its own as a top tier post apocalyptic action drama its like mad max fury road meets the road meets the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy this series of episodes is up ther with any beloved actionscifi trilogies and is better than some the creative team clearly took advantage of what i imagine was a very large budget nothing about his series feels like tv
follows the video games very well awesome story line and action packed costumes and props are great characters look just like in the game as well as costumes i have been looking forward to this for a long time and i havent been disappointed if your into constant action with gore and violence this is definitely for you the actors and actresses do a wonderful job and nothing feels fake or is bad acting the guns pipboy computers and power armor suits are awesome if you like this show you need to play the video game i looking forward to more episodes if you like video game based shows or are on the fence about watching it do it you wont regret it
i rarely write reviews but this absolutely deserves one im completely blown away by this series every episode has gone from strength to strength and finishing with an epic climax everything in this series was spot on for me theyve captured the essences of fallout perfectly ella purnell and walton goggins were brilliant and loved their charactersover the years weve had gaming adaptations that have been poor at best to the absolutely shockers to date halo resident evil welcome to racoon city and resident the series fallout has set the bar now and this is what a gaming true gaming adaptation looks like hats off to the whole cast and geniuses behind the story
im currently on episode  and when i started i was praying and hoping amazon did not ruin fallout but to my surprise i like it so far its falloutive played all fallout games and seeing all the gore the bos a yao guai giant cockroach and a ghoul in the first episodes makes me want to reinstall all of the fallout games and just play again even the bobbleheads made me smilethey couldve ruined fallout but they kept it fallout the weapons are there laser rifle automated turret the assaultron even codsworth well kindaamazon kept every detail according to the game and thats why the show is good did they follow the fallout storylines no but following trying to recreate the story exactly wouldve messed things up so its something new and i like it
fallout on amazon prime is what the gold standard of video game based cinema should be it delivers an incredibly entertaining experience for fans immersed in the captivating universe making it an ideal watch for both seasoned enthusiasts and newcomers alike sharing this journey with my girlfriend with a couple of nukacolas in hand heightened the experience as we marveled at the meticulous attention to detail that remained faithful to the source material each moment brimmed with excitement blending nostalgia with an original narrative that kept us engaged throughout it felt like a heartfelt homage to loyal fans while extending a warm invitation to newcomers welcoming them into the franchise with open arms whether youre a longtime devotee or just stepping into the wasteland fallout promises a satisfying and exhilarating experience that will leave you craving more
all i can say is wow i enjoyed it so much yes there were a few not very lore accurate moments but man this is done so well hyping myself up since  this exceeded my expectations amazon has been hitting it so well in the tv show scene its awesome the show made me want to play fallout  and new vegas again because there were so many homages all of the small details had me pausing the show every now and then just to check out the scene also dog meat i may do another closer watch through to try and apot a mysterious stranger that would be a really good hidden feature if its there war never changes
i am a fan of sci fi movies in general and i have enjoyed many from classicals like the expanse to unconventional like the boys i have never played fallout as i did not have the time to do it therefore i didnt know the story and the show got me hooked from the first minute to the last i cant even imagine how did amazon release all the episodes at once as the series have everything for addiction and more great characters fantastic mood retro futuristic steampunk sets up to the tiniest detail excellent script which always brings a surprise post nuclear world with a touch of western movies fine humor every piece fits without feeling too forced and leaves you wanting for more for me it was a very nice surprise and made me put fallout  and metro exodus on my bucket list
so lets start by stating that ive never played the games so im writing this as someone who is coming in cold to this world and these charactersi thought that i could watch walton goggins in anything but after half of one episode then had to revise that ideathese observations are mild spoilers for the first half hour but not for the seasonso the first five minutes where nobody in the house notices the intense flash of a nuclear bomb detonating was odd since it was pretty damned brightthen a raid where the victims were still reacting with surprise  minutes after it startedthen another few scenes in a training camp leading up to a completely baffling promotionfinally some poorly scripted cartoon like villains digging up gogginsmaybe theres a reason that this seemed so poorly written and directed that fans of the game might understand but it seemed like a very amateurish attempt to wring something from a bit of gore and a bit of lore that has completely escaped meshame because im a big fan of cartoon like gore and also science fictionmaybe this will do it for you but it certainly didnt do anything for me
the fallout tv adaptation is without a doubt the best ive ever seen the cast is exceptional the visual effects are stunning and the script is faithful to the games universe as a diehard fan i can safely say that this series has exceeded all my expectationsits true that if there was anything to criticize i would be the first to point it out but in this case there is simply nothing to complain about the series is perfect in every wayi cant wait for the next seasons which i hope will be even longer and more epic than the first i highly recommend fallout to everyone especially fans of the franchise its a mustwatch series that masterfully captures the essence of the game
ive been a fallout fan for half of my life first picking up fallout  not too long after launch and falling in love with the lore the universe the characters and the aesthetic from that first step out moment exiting the vault and the world below opening up down the hill from the scenic overlook this series has grabbed hold of me and not let go from new vegas to fallout  and fallout  from the ttrpg board gamesto fan films comics and podcasts there is nothing like fallout so how do you adapt it in a way that works how do you satisfy fans while also introducing the world of fallout to a whole new generation and nongamerslike this from the opening moments to the very last scene of a very very familiar place i love that were going in season i loved every moment of it the way in which they perfectly captured the layout and design of vaults to the game meta the dark humor it was beat of beat like watching someone play fallout  walton gogginsthat absolute unit of an actor was a power force in this eating up every single scene he was in nolan knew the assignment very clearly having a deep love of the games having played them himself the ensemble cast of this was so so well chosenthe music was perfectly on pointthey nailed the set design the world aesthetic the unique meta experience of the gamer the music slapped the opening and closing credits were uniquely artistic and stunning we get a huge teaser at the end of episode  in terms of where were going for season  im fully onboard cant wait to see what awaits usfor me this is one of the best video game adaptations i have ever seen thank you this has also relit the fires of the entire fallout fandomno small feat
when i first saw the fallout trailer i expected that it wouldnt be good because netflix had already ruined the witcher and video game adaptations took liberties with the source content in what seemed like an effort to completely ruin them instead fallout makes sure that the locations are familiar to people who have played every game that the characters themselves are appropriate that the history is respected and that every detail game players had become accustomed to appears in the series theres a hacking scene a scene where characters get massacred in the slowmotion gory style of fallout  and even the pipboy plays a big part in the story a video game adaptation could not be done any better than the way amazon adapted fallout i can only hope that the second and third seasons of the series are as good as the first one amazon doesnt have the best of luck in creating decent followups to stellar premieres
my whole family  girlfriend who is not usually into this kind of thing is absolutely gripped by fallout we have watched it right though and went straight back to the beginning again i have been a long standing fan and have played every game and it certainly doesnt missevery aspect matches with the game and has the same feeling the visuals are fantastic and the attention to detail is second to none even the cars have been made to match with the game lucy is great and you can get a real connection with her character same with the ghoul maximus im on the fence with but i believe he may be hiding a secret and that is why hes so odd we shall seegive it a watch you will not be disappointed bring on season  please
i havent played the games and i had a lot of questions during the first couple of episodes so i would therefore suggest that nongamers see a youtube video going over the vault lore before watching theres basically an alternate version of american history starting around  and in the future people will live in different metaphorical theme parks connected by a nuclear hellscape it helps to understand that vault  is a bit of an anomaly in that its connected to other vaults and the residents are not all plant monsters or brain robots also skip the trailer in the midcredits of the first episode it contains some spoilers for the early episodesproduction was topnotch as were the actors a allaroundthe brilliance of the show is a combination of how fallout the game is formatted and how the showrunners chose to commit it to film the game lends itself to storytelling because there is no main character its more about exploring the bizarre postapocalyptic dystopia the developers imagined and the kind of miniworlds within itthe vaults so you can do almost anything by asking what if there were a town where everyone was  what would that look like given that it would have been very easy for the writers to lazily coopt an existing storycharacters or maybe change the features of one of the core reoccurring game items for plot convenience but no they created new characters and appear to have done their due diligence to frame the story within the context of the preexisting world and now its canon to the game world well donesome people may find the gore and violence to be too much but i enjoyed all the punching shooting and explosions most of the jokes landed with me and i appreciate the dark cynical humor that the franchise is apparently known for i appreciate that the writers took the time to write characters who faced obstacles failed and evolved from their experiences to become stronger characters or character development if you willthere were certainly plot holes particularly towards the end but they were either forgivably minor or things that can be fixed in a future season there were no points during fallout that really grabbed me emotionally like in one piece or peacemaker which is fine i dont need to cry to enjoy a show but its not a serious show in that sense people die all the time but the main characters always feel safe and the minor characters feel like npcs when they goi cant speak for gamers but i had a great time with fallout enough so that if i had a game system id want to play it just to spend more time exploring that world ill probably end up watching it again in the next few months and then once more before season  drops its made by the same people as west world and fallout is almost as good as ww season  but ww also fell off a cliffha during the second season therefore i have to remain agnostic on fallouts future otherwise its a great little scifi show for people who dont mind swearing and gore
"im three episodes in and im loving the tv show so far it is just like the fallout games i love how they used every
every asset fro the game like i love it every episode of it the pip boys and power armor are so detailed as well as the vault im looking forward to the future of the fallout tv and fallout universe i was to excited to see this yesterday i was checking the amazon prime page  times every hour and it was worth it in the end because
they picked a great story line and actor for the show they are doing a fantastic thing and i hope there are more episodes to come in the future vault"
i bought an issue of a pc magazine once back then when magazines were a thing it came with a disk in which there were demos for several games and a full version of fallout  that was my first introduction to the fallout universe my english was not as good at the time as it is now and the gameplay seemed very hard as well but it was also very interesting and i am glad i didnt just throw it aside and forgot about it instead i found a very detailed and thorough walkthrough of the game and i started playing it obsessively while constantly referring to the walkthrough and trying to translate it this game and its walkthrough are a significant milestone in advancement of my english it has a very special place in my heart but not just for that reason but because it is one of the best games i have ever played now coming back to the present i was walking down the street the other day and there were many billboards advertising fallout as a new tv show that was kind of a surreal feeling to me how the games become such a mainstream thing in freaking turkey there are billboards advertising it so of course even though i had set my expectations to the minimum i had to check it outhaving become so cynical and skepticalseparate things folks about anything that comes out of entertainment industry i cannot stress this enough the show was ok so far but its just one season and it can go in any direction from here so keep that in mind this is only about season  the first positive thing that id like to mention about the show is the actors with few exceptions but i wont specify the bad ones i remember walton goggins from the hateful eight  he was great in that movie and hes really good in this one too ella purnells also good and very beautiful visual effects are acceptable for a tv show although the physics of a lot of things like vertibirds are kind of nonsensical but in fallout universe i dont mind those so they really made a decent start lets hope they keep this quality upnow the important part the story i think the premise of the show is the most realistic part about fallout universe you might think that a lot of things about corporations and capitalism have been taking into a level that is too far fetched if you think so you might be consuming a lot of mainstream media take this scene from the show where they weigh and throw puppies into incinerators if they are not above certain weight that seems unrealistically cruel right well what if i tell you that chicken and egg industry literally grinds  billion chicks a year they separate them depending on their genders males are thrown onto a conveyor belt and they shiver on their way to the grinder this is called chick culling and you cant make this  up also look at the current wars going on around the world there are literal companies that make weapons of war and then lobby politicians into escalating situations into wars i dont want to name these companies or countries because then this review will definitely get deleted all im saying is there is nothing farfetched about the shows premise about evil companies if anything real world is a lot uglier speaking about these companies there is also something meta about the show although its nothing as nefarious as the things mentioned above this franchise itself has become the symbol of company greed i highly recommend a youtube video named the fall of  from a yt channel called internet historian the video has currently over  million views and its not just fallout franchise they are still trying to milk their customers by selling the same game es v skyrim over and over again instead of coming up with new creative original stuffthese are my thoughts about season  and i hope they really go fully deep into that crazy fallout universe in the future where we can have episodes involving literal extraterrestrial aliens and even ghosts
"as a rabid fan of the games i am happy to report that this show absolutely nails the lore and essence of fallout right down to the obligatory shallow main plotin defense of the series the lore of this world has always been the draw rather than some big main quest there is always a cheap excuse to get you out of the vault then you forget about that reason for  hours while you make your own story so how do you make that experience into a good noninteractive story beats me but i think they did it as well as could be expectedthe good

i am huge scifi fan and this series is just fabulous the first seven minutes set the tone and once the characters were introduced and the plots setup up it rockedshock drama great fx great acting thrillsaplenty tons of humor amazing soundtrack what a blastthis genre has experience the void over the last few years this is setting a new quality standard for this type of series hugely watchable its as bingeworthy as anything ive seen in the last few years i hope everybody enjoys it as much as i did and im now going to watch it again which i never do but this is that goodbest dystopian series ever
i never was interested in the fallout series seemed like a genre i would never play gave the show a shot and after an episode was hooked now playing fallout  and enjoying seeing the connections between the game and show really like the storyline with the flashbacks between motivations for the ghoul the mystery was good and had a couple twists with some being predictable i would say the love story really didnt hook me and could be absent from s found maximus to be unlikeable unless he was with his squire i would have also liked some more motivations of the brotherhood but really came out of nowhere for me 
ive played fallout  since its release i go back time and time again i wander around the wasteland i befriend piper nick valentine cait preston i save abernathy farm you get the drift i started watching with high hopes loved lucy from the beginning couldnt take my eyes off the charismatic cooper but struggled to like maximus he seemed so weak the landscape amazing the vaults equally so power armor blue jumpsuits they captured the lore beautifully just what id really hoped for the series grew and grew i started to understand and appreciate maximus more thadeus too at times violent at times funny even sadly romantic the conclusion of s stunning surprising i found myself really moved by lucys mother for some reason was enough of her left to recognize her daughter her husband the man who betrayed her but what a finale to a wonderful adaptation bravo i look forward to lucy and coopers next adventure to find his family and wonder what maximus can do with the brotherhood
for those who played the video game i am not one of them im told by wikipedia that the tv series is true and canon whatever it means with the gamesand todd howard who directed various games in the series and ended up in charge of the franchising for bethesda refused several offers before meeting jonathan nolan an avid gamer of the series they say and deciding that his vision for the adaptation was the best possiblefor those who didnt know that the game even existed i am part of this group i can assure you that this is one of the funniest cleverest most spirited and entertaining tv series everella purnell is mesmerising too beautiful at least in this jumpsuit walton goggins is the coolest ghoul youll ever meet and the story although far from being original is super catchingenjoy
honesty this show is really really good no joke by far one of the best videogame adaptations to date i liked it more than the last of us and halo tv adaptationstwo game series im far more familiar with than fallout no im not a fan of fallout i played fo  back when it came out one time and that was it so this review isnt coming from a diehard fan of the fallout seriesi knew from the trailer that this adaptation would be a hit what i did not expect was how similar in ways fallout would be to the star wars st lucy and max in particular are practically rey  finn their dynamic and core character traits down to the bone but theyre like a more realized versions of those charactersits difficult discussing this show without going into spoilers it does carry on the legacy of those s pulp horrorscifi films you can render the entire show black  white with that fuzzy audio and itll be right at homethe characters are strong the wasteland shows how quickly motivations flip on a dime how much influence people in power have over others under their charge etc its all well done
i knew a little about the video game but ultimately wasnt sure what to expect after my boyfriend showed the tv show to me turns out to be one of the best tv shows ive seen in a while and actually holds my attention usually ill be scrolling through my phone while i put a show on but this show truly captivated me with a great and mysterious story line i love the casting choices for this tv show and love the growing relationship between the two main characters ill be on the edge of my seat till the next season i honestly can say i cant get enough of this show and would recommend  loved it
fallout does an amazing job of capturing the essence of the fallout games perfectly and the attention to detail is fantastic i felt fully immersed and part of the fallout universe which is so familiar to me yet had its own uniqueness to make it different from the games all the characters were cast perfectly and really were brought it to life within the fallout universe it has been adapted from a game to a tv show smoothly and seamlessly i truly cannot recommend it highly enough if you love the fallout games or even just postapocalypse games or tv shows then this is for you watch it asap
i was seriously intriguied when i saw that nolan an joy are directing this but what is this series about it feels like a super boring adaptation of a video game no characters to feel engaged with just blood and gore and unmeaningfull dialogue sorry but where is the fine craftswomanship from westworldthe main thing that kept me going was the backstory i loved the vault setting and the flashbacks but the wasteland was just pointless like an old western but with the violence of japanese horrormaybe i would appreciate if i played the video games but as an outsider this is just pointless
"to be honest i had low expectations and they completely blown my mind this is a great new story to the franchise which is why im rating it a  they only used the core narrative from the games and made a great new story all characters are well written i love the way each main character has the  different personalities that you can choose in the gamelucy good karma
maximus neutral
ghoul bad karmaalso as a fan of the videogames i could see all the easter eggs which were greatfinale was outstanding last scene blown my mind and i can´t wait for season  i just hope they bring us the th game soon enough"
im a massive fan of fallout and one of the things i really loved about the show is how it supports fans and yet is also good fun to watch for people who know nothing about itfor example i would start laughing over a sarcastic in game reference and my wife who knows nothing about fallout but also loved the show just looks over at me like i had gone mad having not played the game the dialogue added context for her but not humour kind of like the hidden adult content in childrens shows like shrek put in for the parents who are watchingthere are a couple of things that as someone who has played all the games and still plays  regularly you think umm like for example their adaptive take on ghouls but it doesnt really take anything away and is needed to support the storyalready looking forward to season 
i played fallout  and  fully some vegas at my friends house and i will say this show captured fallout perfectly not much more you can add in the show for a season  without overwhelming people i already know season  will be better mainly because the fallout universe has a lot of material to work with we could see super mutants or deathclaws as far as the story it was well done focusing on i think  different character developments while in the crazy universe of fallout they left good space to go in many different directions for season  i also enjoyed the many different emotions they took it the show mixed all human elements nicely comedy drama action slice of life im looking forward to season  thats how you make an adaptation
im not a huge gaming nerd so i didnt have a huge stake in this show being a perfect adaption but this is the most unique thing that has been on television in a very very long time of course all the actors are amazing and that we all love from different things the world building is vast and interesting and terrifying of course we all contemplate the end of the world and what happens after the world ends but this put a very interesting spin on it because it does kind of put in your face how much capitalism is tied into every single aspect of our lives and our deaths i hope there are many more seasons because there is so much to explore
as an avid fallout fan i was worried going into this but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the series is a must watch exceptional attention to detail and largely does resemble the fallout universe and hasnt been watered down for a larger audiencehowever i did find a plot hole la is referred to as the boneyard in fallout and from  the ncr new california republic has control over the entire boneyard and has made it their capital given this season is set in the year  it would be safe to say that there is a bit of a plot hole here if you know a bit too much about fallout than you probably should
i absolutely love this show ive never seen a video game adaptation that was with watching but this show changed thati played the games and this show does a great job with the story my wife who never played video games loved it since you dont have to have played to enjoy the showfrom dogmeat to ghouls the people and places are just like the game the t suits are perfectalso the vaults are spot on the s saccharine sweet mixed with the dark science experiments in the vault the main ghoul is also a really great character showing life before and after was brilliant the writer wove it in together
"i know it is not but it looks like a zach snyder vehiclemultiple locations without connectivity check
lack of character development check
no understanding of characters motivations check
irritating music or score always in the background check
lots of action yet still seems boring check
single thin female warrior who cannot act and you really to not care if she lives or die check
story pushed along by plot device instead of cohesive writing check
not sure who to root for checkthe only difference between this and rebel moon is that rebel moon took place entirely in a green screen warehouse here the actual backdrops are real"
im familiar with the games i never played them watching this series wants me to play them so i can be fully engulfed in the fallout world even more absolutely wonderfully done piece of cinema i binged it all in one sitting and i want morei have nothing negative to say i thought everything flowed really well from beginning to endlots of amazing actors playing their part incredibly welli cant possibly understand the negative reviews even if you dont agree that its not the video game  because its not everything was done to the highest qualityyou dont want to miss this
more than a decade ago i started playing a video game series that would change my life we all know it was falloutit was a dream of mine since then to see a fallout tv or movie adaptation but i never thought it would actually happen until it didwhen it was announced had a small picture in my head of what the show would look like but it definitely exceeded my expectationschristopher nolan being a gamer himself and todd howard being involved in the series is what made me have faith in this showand here i am today watching what i think is the best adaptation of a game ive ever seen along with last of usdefinitely worth it and now only expect the best for the next seasonshout out to aaron moten for his mad acting skills everyone was great but he is special and i hope he gets noticed more and hopefully we get to see more of him in more projects
im currently  episodes into series the opening scene captured my attention with the iconic fallout music i love how the fallout music is spread through the show every scene really brings you into the fallout world the vault scenes are authentic and beautiful its also fun seeing the in game items show up through out the show the raider with the jet was great the sand farmer drinking the emergency drinking water was hilarious great story so far and enjoying the mystery of whats ahead my wife is also enjoying the series and has never once played a fallout game great job on adapting game into a great tv series
i think whether youre a long time fan of fallout or just stumbling upon this by chance youll enjoy it ive been a huge fallout fan for over  years now and the atmosphere set pieces s tracks the ambient music all fantastic its serious when it needs to be dark and gritty but interlaced with just the right amount of that quintessential fallout universe absurdity the sets are my favorite part i think there is so much love care and detail in all of the scenes posters from the games models of furniture items junk all lovingly crafted after the ones in gamesand my favorite part they did an excellent job of pulling from all of the games i mean new vegas has several major nods huge win for me rockit launcher as seen in fo even a mr house cameo they even have a giddy up buttercup just hidden on scene i hope they take this momentum and run with it because theyve really captured the essence of fallout for this fan and im usually quite picky with adaptationsim excited to see more locations creatures people and factions from all of the games and see how it all comes together and im thrilled to see this universe get expanded and i hope it brings a new influx of players to fallout  the community is great
watched just the first episode and i am totally hooked i am a bit older generation and this really brought back some good memories long time ago i played fallout game a lot and movie representation is excellent reminder of good old timesstory is cool cgi are great cast is doing their job nicely and whole set up is exactly as it was in the game so far nothing is missingi am sure that this serial will bring a new wave of game lovers to reignite the flame for this game again people who are familiar with the game will love this and anyone else who is a lover for sf apocalyptic setup will be hooked for sure
why the f did they choose aaron moten to be a lead he sucks its an amazing game adaptation for sure but he ruined it mostly for me all the other actors nailed it great job everyone but him looking forward to the next one and hope they kill off his character id love to see more of the fallout shelters and life within of course life on the surface is a huge part and i hope they show megaton and the children of the atom in the next season i was disappointed but i understand they needed to do a huge info dump for those unaware of the game i was happy to hear that pinkofornia gave them the tax credit that not only should never have been imposed but was ultimately granted
im coming into this review after having watched the show as a newcomer to the fallout franchise i know extremely little about the video games but am familiar with how culturally relevant they are in the video game landscape both by fans and critics alike as a gamer myself i dont really find the fallout games to be my cup of teathat being said im sure there are some things a fallout fan might notice that i as a newbie may not pick up on initially but if you want my short and sweet opinion this show is very good probably one of the better video game adaptations out there though its far from perfect i love that video game adaptations are getting the proper love and respect they are long overdue for and obviously its going to be hard to translate everything from the game screen to the tv screen but for what it was worth this show is something i consider to be its own thing and something that i can recommendim aware this show takes place years after the games thus it has more liberties with its narrative while also being pigeon held by the game lore im not going to nitpick it for what it missed nor am i saying its bad because it played fast and loose with some plot elements from the games and thus its unworthy of viewingi love the aesthetic the theming the cinematography and everything technical wise i adore how they captured the postapocalyptic retro futuristic setting so well theres a sense of dread hopelessness and chaos roaming about in the wasteland and each area the characters visit is so rich with personality vibrancy and chemical fallout i especially loved that they captured the dark and morbid tone the games had with that witty comedy spliced in to really capture how the residents and vault dwellers deal with the oppressive environmentthe cast and acting are really good too ella purnell really captures the doe eyed naive vault dweller persona really well in her performance and she was just a bundle of joy to watch i also want to say i dont think shes a flawless character there are multiple times throughout the show where she is mortally wounded lost a finger gets caught and needs rescuing that it made sense even if she has some skills under her belt i like the idea that despite being this goody two shoes and seemingly equipped to handle the outside world the wasteland proves to be more than she can handle and she uses her wits and resourcefulness to escape situations which makes sense to me it helps also that lucy is a charming character shes resourceful cooperative and kind but shes overly trusting in over her head and witty in her own waywalton goggins is by far the best actor in this show as the ghoulcooper howard he not only feels like hes a character from that scifi s decade but looks the part also his segments were probably my favorite next to lucys hes cool but mysterious and brooding but comedic in his own moments i will say the ghouls arent supposed to be seen as zombies per se but i think the show makes it work regardless im not entirely sure how theyre supposed to behave so i could be wrong therei think the weakest of the protagonist trio is maximus played by aaron moten hes another timid black male lead which is honestly a trope im tired of seeing in these shows but even then he has his own personal charm to his character his hero worship of the brotherhood mixed in with his growing distrust of them once he learns the truth was really well handled even if i felt his scenes dragged on and felt mediocre at times acting wise hes a take it or leave it not particularly stunning nor bad just okay the acting felt a bit stiff at points i feel he should have been given better direction or been recast with someone a bit more convincing in my opinionmoises arias as norm was also really fun to watch its been a while since ive seen him in an acting role i will admit a lot of the male characters besides maybe lucys dad or the ghoulcooper are very meek submissive or timid but in norms case it makes the most sense with his character arc i personally loved that we get to see the internal vault politics the schemes and machinations behind the vaults existences and what happened to the other connected vaults was also something i looked forward to watching he may be sheepish but i loved how cunning and sly he could be when faced with the cultish tendencies of the group hes left withi like the callbacks easter eggs and the attention to detail when designing the costumes accessories and props for the show the armor suits and the pip boys especially are well done i love how they clearly respect the source material embrace the goofiness of the games themes and dont try to talk down to you like youre a child so to speak when delivering dialoguenow all that aside i need to air out some grievances here and there while i do like the story what i think bogged it down to a eight rating for me was that theres an obvious anticapitalist message towards the half end of the show where its implied the good guys were supposed to root for are not as morally grey as we think but were secretly one hundred percent good and im not sure how it works but thats what i got from it lucys mom is barely a character she exists only in flashbacks and feels more like a plot device than her own character the overall grander story and lore was a bit mishandled in that regardthe original game from what ive researched was about the consequences of war nuclear fallout humanitys capacity for evil and the ultimate adage of war never changes the message of this show nukes that games message no pun intended for this seemingly not so subtle evil corporation is bad and caused the end of the world plot frankly that kind of theme can be done well but i dont think it works for this games world and puts a black and white spin on a very nuanced and gray topic regarding humanity and the fact we didnt know who dropped the first bombs in the games lore making it ambiguous on purpose to highlight said theme it doesnt hit the same honestly i wished the writing had made it less obvious who we were supposed to like and dislikethere are a lot of female antagonists in this show which feels kind of weird to me im not implying they cant be evil but in times of war or postapocalyptic settings i would figure there would be more male antagonists or at the very least ones who are in leadership positions however most of the men as ive said before are very passive mopey timid servile goofy and nonthreatening as a whole i feel theres a bias in how the men and women are treated when given the antagonistvillain title the men are one note jerks or baddies and the women get more sympathetic motives or reasonable justification but thats more of a personal gripe for meoverall the show is amazing despite the critiques i highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see it be they a fallout fan newcomer or just someone looking for a fun action adventure dark comedy with gritty gore and wacky hijinks
if youre looking for a dark gritty post apocalyptic fallout show stay far far away right when you get pulled in by the gorgeous set design you immediately get pulled right back out by stiff acting or marvelesque comedy bits this is a theme park type show theres a ton of modern day messaging under a thin veneer of a post apocalyptic world that also pulls one out extremely easily bethesdas influence on this show is very apparent that fallout  assault rifle was tragic over a hundred years after the bombs fell and nobody has tried to rebuild in a serious way shady sands anyone stay far far away from this normie slop if you have any reverence for the source material
jonathan nolan and co put their blood sweat and tears into this everything has been brought to life to a degree i never thought possible it makes sense that jonathan and christopher nolan have worked together before because this tv series is absolutely the same quality that id expect from a movie under christopher nolans namefrom the set design to the costumes the props the scenery the characters the plot everything screams fallout in such an authentic wayas a someone whose childhood was fallout  and new vegas this feels like a love letter i finally know how harry potter and lotr fans felt back in the day
i really was looking forward to seeing the fallout show ive been playing since fallout  and ive enjoyed the world and setting since then i was excited to hear a tv show was in the works and have been optimistic about how it would be portrayed i was not disappointed honestly the most bang on adaptation ive personally ever seen most video game adaptations bastardize the material but not this everything feels and looks like fallout the sets costumes and everything in between the actors do an amazing job especially walton goggins which makes me want to watch more of his films now im that hooked on his performance im looking forward to season 
"i havent played the game but aware of the plotthis a is programme worth watching for many reasons
successful game adaptation mostly
good acting some great
a crazy yet believable dystopian future for humanity
it keeps you drawn in from episode one
nothing over the top with cgi which is a bonusi would highly recommend it i hope season  will eclipse season one and not be a filler like most seriesim not giving the plot away for this very reason there is no hype but facts butwatch it with an open mind discard the game plot and just watch the seriesit will be a bumpy ridebe helpful to your fellow humans okie dokey 😉"
something every fan worries about is how true to the video game the story will be portrayed in the television series we know how awful a production studio can perform when bringing a story from animation to live action we all are aware of the first airbender movie but also aware of the capabilities for greatness like resident evil or doom fallout will definitely be hailed as one of the great ones within the first five minutes you already feel as though your playing another one of their blockbuster video games the writers and director clearly understand the fallout universe to a strong degree if youre familiar with the storylines of previous fallout titles you will automatically feel very comfortable with this storyline and outcomes of scenarios and decisions made will feel very familiar to the true fallout nature were so accustomed to as fans i promise your desire for a true to canon universe told from the liveaction view of this series will be well satisfied in the first thirty minutes of the first episode so grab a snack and a drink and prepare to be sucked in
to be fair i was wanting to dislike this because i thought there was no way it could be good i mean no video game adaption so far has been good except last of us i put in hundreds if not thousands of hours into the games to my surprise i was dead wrong every episode got me more and more excited they hit the nail on the head like a railroad rifle its got the action the dialogue the humor the mystery of the games i found myself getting so enthralled with the world it stayed faithful for the fans and im sure will get new ones as well time to boot up the games again and i suggest you do too time to journey into the wastelandand the final scene of the seriesman are we in for a treat next season
since i was a kid fallout series starting with fallout  was the most amazing and anticipated experience for me ever as a game franchise it had it picks and falls but still for the whole  years it delivered a world not a story but a world i was afraid this show just wont make it oh man i was afraid  this is something i waited for the whole life  a fallout series and damn  amazon didnt disappoint at all this show is brilliant delivering a nice story in a true fallout setting i wont spoiler here at all i just came here to say  if you a fallouts fan be there wasteland postretrofuturism aesthetics or a dark fallout only humoristic approach to a total humanity collapse this show is for you
i mean what genre are shows like the boys or santa clarita they arent black comedy but theres definitly a comedic thread here i tried to stick through the pilot episode but it was hard when it was over i felt relievedim not a gamer  although i did rescue the princess once in the early s my only familiarity with the game fallout is what i researched before writing this review so i wont fit in to the  category of reviews here but most sites describe it as anti capitalist  which is ironic since here in the present were the closest weve ever been to a nuclear war but this series starts in the s like the game where people were truly afraid of nuclear war it was a different political climate to say the leastfrom a purely entertainment perspective this show has not captured my intrigue  at all the war theme is up my ally but its just all in the background so far  a glimpse at the helos some bad mf in iron suits standing by like man servants a trans brother referred to as their the bloodshed in pod  bordered on comical aided by the lois lane dumdum who suddenly knows how to handle a dart gun and survives by luckspeaking of lucy she gets a knife in her abdomen where the blade is vertical but when she goes to staple the wound its now horizontal is this sloppy production or part of the comedy i mean its so blaring im honestly stumpedalthough im not fond of the character i can appreciate the determination and sheltered but diciplined mentality im hoping she becomes a badarse also just kind of glad were past the whole leading lady must be hispanic thingthe pilot is presented in  sections to intro the various groups of characters which i think was a poor decision traditionally a pilot grabs your interest by investing in a handful of characters it would have intrigued me more to have shorter glimpses with more focus on one group or other instead it uses kind of a speeddating technique no one likes thosethe pilot had an opportunity to focus on maximus but his interesting dialog comes after an oddly long pause just in time to almost make the  min scene have some value until then he seems pretty superficial but i can tell hes going to be an ingesting characterto summarize too slow pace too much comedic underpinning boring sountrack immature gore stylei dont think ill be watching more but i thought that about wheel of time too then it hooked me  the st season nd season not recommended is gorecom a category
with so many shows being churned out i didnt expect this to be as good as it wasi played fall out  and attempted  but i couldnt get into them and im sure if there was comments activated here id be destroyed they just didnt do it for mehoweverthis show was aweomeloved the multiple stories happening action not overly aggressive and the development of all characters without and nonsense adding characters that are just whackwhat really made me stay engaged was the storyline there was the announcement of s before the show kicked off which gave me immediate confidence this is the real deal seen a few complaints like its not as good as the last of us those people need a reality check the show had it all
this show is a video game series adaptation done right it keeps all the charm from the games with a ton of nods from things within them in ways that make sense the story itself keeps obvious giveaways that many series give much earlier on and tells an amazing story with characters that feel real ella parnells take on a vault dweller that comes out of the vault into the harsh world is amazing and everything kept well on theme and brand lucy in the vault has aims for the best interests of others whilst also leaving the vault and struggling with the jarring reality it blends nicely with the other characters all that feel they have their own challenges and faults honestly this is a must watch for anyone and if you are already a fallout fan you will likely love this well done to the teams creating this and the actors absolutely amazing and makes me want more very likely to go back and play them now
in the first episodes the main characters didnt do it for me but rather the visuals and the settingambient is what kept me watching it was my  episode before sleep series they really nailed down the visuals and the atmosphere i cannot stress this enough it was awesome to see the game portrayed so well in live actionas things progress you start to find the characters a little more interesting especially the ghoul who was already better than the  main characters from the start as story moves along i start caring a little more about the  main characters but it isnt until the last episode of s that i feel more connected to them speaking of which that last episode was awesome it alone is what earned the rating a bump from a  to if you played the games its a no brainer you should watch it if you havent give it a try and maybe try to stick with it even if episode  doesnt help it slowly improves and reaches its finest at the season finale
i was very impressed with this show and how it turned out i was very cautious and nervous they would ruin the universe when releasing this show attempting to appeal to new fans over original fans however im shocked in how well they managed to appeal to both side as a fan of the series i really enjoyed the added lore to the universe and the live action adaptations of factions and creatures however dont get me wrong some stuff could of been clearer eg the destruction of shady sands yet its not that big of a deal but i watched with someone who had never heard of this series but now are completely invested in the lore of fallout i think all the actors and writers did a incredible job and i cant wait for season  absolutely fantastic show
ive been playing fallout games for  years so yes im a fan of those games therefore my review is a bit biasedbut the show is exactly what i expected when i first heard of this show being made i had a secret wish that vince gilligan would do it because his shows give the same kind vibe but j nolan nailed it it just cannot get any betteri seriously wonder i guess i gotta read other reviews how people who havent played the game look at the showin short if you have ever been a fan of fallout or you are just a gamer you are going to love it and yes i still wonder what it would be like if vince gilligan would direct it could i then give  stars
as a fan who has played fallout  multiple times i can confidently say that the new fallout tv series is an absolute triumph the show masterfully captures the essence of the beloved video game franchise while creating a compelling and engaging narrative that appeals to both longtime fans and newcomers alikethe series expertly balances the iconic elements of the fallout universe such as the retrofuturistic aesthetic dark humor and postapocalyptic setting with fresh and innovative storytelling the writers have crafted a gripping plot that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats with welldeveloped characters and unexpected twists that maintain the spirit of the gamesits important to note that adapting a video game into a television series is no easy feat and the creators of fallout have done an exceptional job they have successfully translated the immersive world and rich lore of the games into a visual medium providing a new perspective on the universe that fans have grown to lovefor those who may be critical of the show for not perfectly mirroring the games its crucial to remember that television is a different art form with its own unique constraints and opportunities the fallout series takes creative liberties to ensure that the story is engaging accessible and emotionally resonant for a wide audiencein conclusion the fallout tv series is a mustwatch for fans of the franchise and anyone who appreciates wellcrafted postapocalyptic storytelling its a delightful treat that honors the source material while standing on its own as a remarkable piece of television bravo to the creators and cast for bringing this iconic universe to life in such an outstanding manner
omg everything is soo good from the scenery to the props to the lore this is an unreal replication of the games great story great acting great adaptation how much did this live action adaptation cost stimpaks rusty cars super duper marts all the food from the games t armor even the stairs and steel structures in the vaults i love how the secret experimental vaults are exposed and the corporate structure behind the vaults and the bombs is made clear its almost as if the tv series is designed to fill in the gaps in the game lore if you ever played the games this adaptation is the best youll ever see more please more
had potential and had a great diasatopian vibe at start but wooden acting very poor sfx and ridiculous storyline utter load of gibberish written by a  year old with a vivid imagination dont waste my timethey add the odd bit of ultra violence for dramatic effect but it fails for deliver the characters are non relatable and i care for non of them loads of critical stuff not explained and incoherent stick to the games as this adaptation is a waste of time to watchgot to episode  and gave up as it was painful to watch some weird  year old zombie with no nose who doesnt seem to get hurt crappy metal space marines who are dicks some innocent girl whos lived in a tin for her life who suddenly is bear grylls just weird tacky and poorly executed avoid
i was not expecting much from this show the beginning was good the middle was not that great and the end was good again overall this show was a good watch even with the shoved in the face dei the actors did a good job who were selected lucy though fits her character very well her eyes remind me of an anime character not in a bad way it is unique and fits i do feel the topless section of one episode was a bit unnecessary and didnt add anything to the show i did want to see more things outside the vault that you see in the games but i believe they will if they get renewed i enjoyed how the season ended good addition and not the bit least is the ghoul without him i dont believe the show would of carried
definitely the best video game series i dont know what impression this work will make on people who are not familiar with the world of fallout but as an old connoisseur of this universe i liked almost everythingobviously this is a test season based on the results it will be clear whether the sequels will be filmed but i am sure that there will be quite a few of them the fallout world has many readymade scenarios you could make  seasons of the shelter stories alonethe story is classic for a series of games  something someone is kidnapped and the main character sets off on a journey full of dangers and adventures we will be greeted by classiclooking shelters power armor pipboy red rocket ghouls and much moreand of course there is the bloody mess perkenjoy it traveler end remember  war never changes
what the whole pieace of joy immersion into this world one to one thanks a lot its truly match to the world of fallout even when skiming to the surface of hollywoods kandy picture the frame is perfect director who create and support of this incrediable costumes is a gineus no doubt how cool watch when you see not the flaivour of coulor but also a spirit of enviroment and perfect smell of digital world applause and admiration of hard work theyve done i asume thank you thank you very much so many reffers to original items in the game some of those not purpose to match for reason to discuss but again its most truly adoptaition of game on the screen ever thank you actors castand staff youre the best

as someone with  hours in fallout  and  hours in fallout  i can confirm that all the aspects in this film series are very accurate from the pip boys interface fallout fallout new vegas map and fallout  inventory menu to the power armour making you mega overpowered fallout  they also made the yao guai bear a loooooot more scary than ingame  personally i would run for my life even if i had a set of x power armour if i saw a yao guai that was in the series it was truly scaryoverall very accurate with some very nice additions such as the inside of the power armour being iron man style
my word i dont think ive ever finished watching a tv series and the next day started it over from the start until now that isi was so nervous about amazon making this especially after the disaster that was well any number of shows really except for expansebut this is fantastic i did not even dual screen it like i normally do as a long time fan of the franchise  of all my gaming time being on fallout i worried that theyd either lean so heavily into member berries to bait fans or be too low level to lean into normies and spoil it all with heavy handed social messagingbut it all worked out great the main characters are very well rounded and even the side characters work very well no marysue stuff eithereven normies who dont play the games seem to like it  certainly within my circle people who dont know a stimpack from radaway enjoy itthank you to the amazing cast and producers  you did a great job here
i have been a fan of the games for over a decade this show reflects perfectly the vibe of the games while creating a new original story within the fallout universe a perfect blend of violence and humor that is ever more unpredictable incredibile journey and final plot twist leaving plenty of questions and knots to be tied for season  characters back stories and development feel very real and relatableand going beyond into unveiling many elements of this world that werent explained in the gamesi hope this enlarges the fandom of this piece of arti wish to be frozen as i await season 
shiny lightsabers things that look like things make me feel goodno matter breaking cannon or lore or even bad pacingmodern filmmaking at its finest as expectednearly as good as haloseriously how do you have a world full of amazing lore and end up with thiscannon changes out of pure spite washing away fallout    and fallout new vegas the latter being easily the best in the franchiseit looks good and some good actors but the incessant changes just feel like pointless cultural appropriationid rather play fallout  than watch this againexpecting this review to be deleted by amazon owned imdb
how do you make a that makes the gamers feel like that they are in the game and the audience feel like they are watching a good show how do you fit every detail every small reference every easter egg from all the games in the series and still keep things interesting how do you interconnect  different games in one story how do you make three separate protagonists that are believable equally interesting and not break the continuity of the universe youre making this show has no business being so good its almost better than some of the games the humour is sometimes burst out loud the characters are fun to watch again this show has no business being so good it makes other shows like last of us threebody look like childs work again it punches several weight classes above its weight i hope season  is even better cautiously
as a fan of the games i went into this show reluctantly while also being very excited for it this show blew past all my expectations and beyond the opening scene grips you hard with an emotionally charged backstory for one of the protagonist and gives new viewers a kick in the head as for what to expect from the show with its retro aesthetic this show like the games stands out form other postapocalyptic shows the story itself is also great with a good setup middle and ending with the show heavily teasing a next season in its last scene and credits this looks like it could be a lot more than a onehit wonder
as a long time fan of fallout i was leary when i heard a show was coming out for it afterall it has been a well known problem that video game adaptations do not always go off well however not only does it seamlessly intertwine video game lore into the story it also makes the world feel as you are back in the fallout universe for anyone bashing on the show they are honestly just haters walton googins plays a sort of mash up of clint eastwood from the gbu franchise and henry fonda from once up a time in the west the main character played by lucy also makes you feel like she would be a genuine vault dweller in real life as a player of the game her naive nature does not surprise me at all not to mention they take a familiar trend in the game and apply it the one where the main character gets waylaid by other side missions before they can get to the main either way this show is great so far
the series overall is very good and the characters are played by excellent actorsthe scenery the story the production are all goodwhat is annoying as hell is the over use of old songs i understand that part of the story is set in the time of these songs and it would have been good if they put maybe  or  songs to showcase this throughout the seriesbut no the producers creators and god knows who else chose to bombard us with multiple old songs that made them redundant and very very annoying this removed a big chunk of the series attraction for me i mean whats with this stupid trend of playing a soft old song when someone is massacring othersotherwise i enjoyed the series
from nuka cola bottles cram cans and sugar bomb commercials i saw everything totally faithful to bethesdas franchise from an assaultron buried in the sand to a mr handy in an abandoned super duper mart it was all wonderful eyecandy to fans of the games the writing and acting was stellar we are thrilled to see walton goggins involved as a main lead and ella purnells portrayal of a naive vault dweller was excellent the backstory of all the shows characters was insightful now we want more id personally like to see the backstory of michael emersons character as well as sarita choudhurys kudos to todd howard well done my dear sir well done
"oldtimer gamer here bit computers
im always up for the latest and greatest when it comes to
a graphical detail
b gameplay
c storyline
d depthwell the fo series is something that only the greatest of producersdirectors should dare to take onwell they nailed itthe detail is truly astounding the relationship to gameplay has caused me to constantly pauserewind the video to take it in the story is of bethesda quality including the music and due to the story depth im hopinglooking forward to series the acting is superb and thats both actors new and establishedmiss this at your own loss"
lets start with my end coments first its a lot of baloney after all the hype we heard about this new show it seemed to be just up my sleeve unfortunately although the scenery is good and lots of fighting between different types of people it is not clear initially what this show is about probably one has to be a gameplayer to know which characters are evil good or indifferent even after viewing all  episodes i still dont have that answer i presume in the game the player decides who is good or bad it reminded me a lot of westworld though it is very different and not westworld but the people behind this series also produced westworld i expected a better show   
i was required to type enough characters for this to count as a review but this next single sentence would be my entire review if it were up to mewhether you love the games or just love some good tv if youre even thinking about giving this a try after watching the trailer do yourself a favor and just dive right on inthis show is fun gory eerie wild random and everything youd expect from a fallout series and its absolutely enjoyable whether you know anything about the world of fallout or not the soundtrack sets scenarios costumes characters creatures sounds actors extra little details easter eggs etc are all excellent the creepiness and oddness and desperation of the wasteland is illustrated beautifully and at times humorously or grotesquely or both at the same timei hate leaving reviews and i dont leave them often i only wanted to drop a sentence or two but i love great tv and great movies and im by no means claiming this as a goat show but its pretty dang enjoyable and you should just watch it and inevitably enjoy it boom i did it blabbered on for the required character limit all just because i enjoyed this show so much i hope everyone else who watches it gets a nice hefty kick out of it as well enjoy secure your future and the futures of your loved ones by putting down a deposit on your very own vaulttec residence today
absolutely love it this dark humour with great character stories and perfectly picked actors who play thembrilliant sets true to the game and attention to details are spot on and find myself looking at every part of the scenes for them really hope this is more then a couple of seasons gory and action packed scenes with an amazing soundtrack to go with iton to episode  and excited to see the rest i didnt think they could make it as good as the game but id say watching it is better then playingonly thing id say is the dark or night scenes are too dark but overall a brilliant programme that is immersive
fallout is  of my favourite video games series i was really skeptical about a tv show since the games already set a really high bar when bringing something over to a new space in a lot of ways it needs to be just as good if not better then the originals creation when nolan said he enjoyed playing the fallout games this was a good sign that he understood about the fallout universethroughout watching the series it was great fun pointing out so many things from the games the art style was truly amazing and many things werent redesigned which i personally thought was a good thing certain stuff was actually improved upon like the elevators vault entrance and fire arms the story was great and arguably better then the main quest line in the video games throughout the series i just wanted to hop into the universe myself explore vault  and the commonwealth the series far from exceeded my expectations and i have spent hundreds of hours playing the games even if you have never played the games though the tv show is a separate story and you will easily be able to follow along
good show with an original concept and universe paced well mostly great work by walton goggins is great as the ghoul delivers his lines and the characters cynicism really well ella purnells done a fine job as well lending to her character the impression that shes actually grown up in a vault and lacks understanding of normal social or ethical norms etc in scenes  good bit of detail aaron moten is alright but is a bit too awkward in his acting which can come off a bit inconsistent with his character and offputtingthe only annoying thing about the show is the often meaningless slow motion montages to random retro music it is way overused and often feels completely forced and out of placeaside from that its a fairly well made show  theyve obviously practiced some restraint and selectiveness with cgi and that helps  the visuals never feel too artificial or messy
i love tv shows and have watched a lot of shows i am a male and i love action and intricate storytelling the storylines comes together and its absolutely insane im serious its my new favorite show ever better than breaking bad invincible the punisher game of thrones prison break shogun love death robots stranger things and the boys those are just a few of my top shows and i absolutely cant believe that a video game live action show would take my new number one spot the lore is phenomenal and the soundtrack adds suspense when needed or it adds to the fun vibes to make the show more interesting at times this show is very unique its honestly multiple genres at the same time but it comes together well highly recommend
fallout is one giant allegory for america after another  years ago that realization sucked me deep into fallout  it had the same effect on jonathan nolanthe tone of fallout is difficult to match existential horror balanced by bleak humor to create a vast valley where any emotion can take place the show gets it about as perfect as it can its often intense enough to put me on the edge of my seat every joke is funny enough to make me laugh out loud these extremes open a space where anything can happenthe cast is top shelf with veterans like kyle mclachlan and sarita choudhury and the impeccable walton goggins in a career performance the younger cast moises aires ella purnell are perfect and newcomer aaron moten steals the show with an extremely tense and emotional introductionthe plot is already complex with mysteries to be solved and political themes up to its eyes beautiful show solid 
i havent played the game but was eagerly awaiting this series having seen the trailers i binged the whole season in a day and still wished for morefrom start to finish the show doesnt disappoint the dystopian storyline is refreshingly unique unpredictable and engrossing it did a very good job of leaping between characters in different locations and time periods without stressing viewer cognition as a result the plot progresses urgently and theres no point where attention drifts or boredom sets inthe characters were well written well acted vibrant and relatable production quality and special effects are top notchpleasingly it didnt put undue stress on interpersonal relationships or lecture the audience with political correctness  mistakes that have ruined so many potentially good shows latelythis is for me the best scifi released for a number of years  small or big screen i was left wanting more and will be impatient for a second season brilliant
if you expect this series to restore some of your childhood memories and atmosphere of playing old fallout games than you are in for a huge disappointment this tv series is basically a dumb generic hollywood excrement only difference being fallout aesthetics honestly it feels like watching a star wars franchise or witcher or any other crap thats recently been produced in usyou will not feel the desolate expanse of the wasteland that postwar us has become actually it feels like entire action of this season takes places in an area the size of a football field main characters constantly jump one into another especially when it is required that their ass is saved and it happens all the time perhaps the most retarded hollywood cliche that should be treated as insult to an adult viewer you will see main protagonists visiting the same few locations that are at the very same time lush green wintery with halted vegetation and a scorching dessert within walking distance from each otherthe characters themselves are simple and extremely dumb the only exception that stands out is the ghoul that is played exceptionally well as if taken directly from a tarantino movie and this is what i dont understand there is gore in this movie it is fallout after all there is even nudity and sexual themes this means the movie is suitable for  viewers in most countries however the plot and characters are designed as if for kids and young teens i really dont get itthere are other things that are extremely annoying like overdoing s music to the point where it feels odd to view what is actually on the screen there is utterly unnecessary timeline that takes place in the prewar us there is maximus childhood trauma scene that is replayed on every episode of the season as if we had amnesia and as if that should suffice to explain his actions and motivations there are plot holes on every corner to many to count there are  main characters instead of one the list could go oni shouldve expected the crap to unfold before my eyes already after seeing bethesda logo at the beginning of the first episodes after all it is bethesda studio that turned one of my favorite games into a dull and cringe franchise on the positive side they couldve cast anna taylor joy as a main character to put the final in the coffin they did not also ghoul was cool hence  stars
i am not reviewing it based on how good adaption it is of the game as i am sure nongamers will be watching this series toobased on simply a series it does a lot of things amazinglythe atmosphere the storyline the cast the music the cinematography the direction most of these things hit the ball out of the parkas it is created by johnathan nolan i can sense a lot quite similarity between this series and westworld the man in black is one example and ramin as a music composer secondstill it has a lot of unique moments twists and character growthits dark witty violent and sometimes funny the actors did a really good job especially ella and waltoni understand if it lacks certain things based on the game but someone who doesnt know about source material i find it a really good scifi apocalyptic series
its beautiful the imagery and everything totally faithful to the play both in drama and humour perfectly enjoyable even for someone who doesnt know the game my wife is proof of this she didnt even play it but she watched it with me and enjoy pleasure those who do know it will notice the impeccable set faithful to the original in every element every little object from the cake slices to the weapons or stimpaks clothes plunderers and the various fabrics are flawless the actors the törtènet every movement is perfectly created the music and sound are of good quality and bring the game atmosphere now thats the perfect adaptation
ive been writing film scripts for years a couple actually garnered some interest i thought i was if not a great writer at least maybe a good one had some potential then i watched fallout and suddenly i know the truth even if i had the talent to be a great writer i simply do not have the imagination because i must say i wouldnt have couldnt have thought up th of the surprises jonathan nolan and his writers gave me not to mention the inspired visuals entertaining dialog and stunning twists add to that the brilliant acting of walton goggins the best thing about the fantastic justified and kyle maclachlan yes of twin peaks fame and leslie uggams who was a talented musician and actress fifty years before dead pool made her a household name to a new generation add to that a group of talented young actors and an eric estrada of chips fame  i dont mean the worst decision michael pena ever made i mean the original  tv show and a video game with a terrifying premise and you have everything you need this show is fantastic and my screenwriting career is over maybe i can still write songs ive been doing that for  years after fallout its my only chance
i want to be as general as possible not to spoil anything just go watch it its really good seriouslyits really really goodthis show is so good and so true to the series i literally made this account on imdb just to post this reviewthe atmosphere characters sounds references and even the stuff theyve added just screams fallout i really like the attention to small details the high quality costumes and the cgi is really good as well from the minute ive started watching i was hooked i had to binge the entire show in a day and its such a good timing with it being available here on a weekend im really struggling with words to describe how well made this is at this point i feel like im forcing myself to write everything good about it but all im gonna say is again i really love seeing how true theyve kept to the games universe and its aesthetics mostly based off of the aesthetics in fallout  but the show is just gorgeousthis show gave me faith in modern tv
as a long time fan of fallout    nv this show nails it  i played  firstit takes place after most of the games do which is a great idea as it allows for room to use game events as history to inform some of the story telling while also not being constrained by trying to follow a particular games plotthe vibes the setting the costuming everything is incredibly well executed the lore around the vaults is perfect the number of small immersive moments from the game like the hacking of a terminal in the overseas office is perfectthe character writing is fantastic especially how each of the characters journeys come to a fantastic conclusion at the end
so first off i grew up playing all of these fallout games especially all of the rpg games by bethesda shoot if i wanted to id restart every game just for the fun of it quiete literallynow at the beginning when this shows st trailer came out i was excited yet very skeptical because of how some live action and reworked showsmovies have personally disappointed me but this this had me watch the entire season in one day yes in one day it sucked me right in lolat the end after watching it now ive been wondering whether this show was an introduction to a new fallout game maybe maybe not it was indeed very nostalgic and well made please give it try ive read some bad reviews but i promise it never hurts to give something a try
what makes this a great adaptation is not only the lore is correct but its everything this show has great pacing acting and overall vibes its like playing the games i will if u do not like slight nudity dont watch this this show is exactly how i wanted to see a fallout show done i was hooked after the raider attack in episode  if this show isnt picked up for a second season i swear to god i will march down to bethesda and amazon myself and riot no agenda is being pushed great twist at the end and excellent build up to it anyone fan of the games or not could pick this up and enjoy it
im a hardcore fallout fan and have played through all fallouts from fallout  forwards and couldnt stick watching past the pilot epthe show looks visually cool but everything else is bland and expectable all characters except the cowboy ghoul are unrelatable and annoying the dialogue is bland and does not grasp your attention at all most actors are neverheard nobodys and dont bring anything cool to the table the music score is overused modern scifistyle drone stuff and does not fit into the setting wacky and uncomfortable humor kinda breaks the immersion most jarring thing is that every scene makes the whole thing feel like a disney movie made for kids every bad guy with evil intentions can be sensed from mile away and character actions in fight scenes are over the top madness aside from the ghoul the pilot episode lacked any sense of seriousness which i was expecting considering the gritty postapocalyptic fallout settingif you see yourself as a serious fallout fan i do not recommend watching this if you have not played the games and are interested maybe give it a try anyway the best youll be getting is a mediocre show with bland dialogue uninteresting characters and predictable plot not worth my time imo
why is the hollywood standard for filming series especially for those who can offer unlimited content persistently only  episodes why isnt it  episodes per seasonso little happened here in the first seasonthe characters are naive just like for level  of the game for them to be upgraded i hope that another  seasons can be filmed in which the action will develop but that will cost viewers another  years of waitingthere are also certain flaws for my taste such as unnecessary trying to be as believable as possible with the game and the acting that supports it seems rather naive i also find showing disintegrated body parts disgusting unnecessary mass nudity in one of the episodes unnecessary brutal sex in the first episode etcall in all a great series for the fallout game fans and of this genre lovers
im not a big fan of the fallout series so my favorite fallout game was the very unpopular fallout  until now because of its great environmental storytelling which most gamers are just not capable to noticebut the series is a no brainer for meits a bit too much designed as a game like series so lucy literally in the first scene sets her character sheet by describing her skills for example and within the episodes they always have some sort of sidequest implementednevertheless they manage to merge it with the main story much better than the games ever didmaybe todd howard profits from this work with the show runners and learns how to design stories better in its gamesmy favorite and i guess it is most peoples favorite is the ghoul character from walton gogginsthis characters gives the series its depth from my perspective and it is always interesting how his story arc is going on also they used him as the character that describes the world and the reasons how it came to this worldwhile lucy is more the fish out of water character and maximus more the anti hero so they managed to give the series various perspectives with the charactersthe world design is super great adapted from the games fans of the games will be knowing every single object and even locations but they naturally build the world with it and do not try to create a new interpretation of fallout and throw fan service in it yes this goes out to you disney and star warsthe dark humor and explicit violence is also very fitting although the humor might be off putting for non fallout fans or general people that have issues with dark sense of humoreven though the show runners claim there is no message in the series they forget that the word of fallout is a message itself and thats very anticapitalistic and also very critical to our society which is even if they not intended it very perfectly carried over from the gamesthere were some thing i did not like and that is the plot convenience that is used throughout the series and even the plot armor there is no real gravitas for the characters at all so they resolved many scenes with totally stupid solutions in the game itself you can die i think it is one of the best game adaptions at all the last of us was great but it was basically the game without its interactivity fallout takes the spirit of the game and creates a great showi am looking forward to the next season although i am careful with my expectations the show runners did westworld to and wrote it into a grave
looking forward to a better result from a season  if there is onecoming from a film buff who followed fallout since the very first game by brian fargo and interplay who has their living room decorated in a fallout  theme who has finished fallout fallout  fallout  fallout new vegas and spent  hours in fallout  and who is also a fan of films such as the mad max series with a particularly fond regard for mad max furiosa and having loved the films the road the young ones and the rover i can say this production is a solid effort but fell quite short of the intrinsic potential of a wasteland epic in so many ways that while it felt passable and somewhat enjoyable it was largely disappointing there is absolutely no reason a fallout series with this quality of production and resources should fall short of the first few seasons of the walking dead but it does it just isnt as interesting and dynamic the real culprit appears to be their struggle with bringing nonfallout players into the fold storywise having to bog down their ideas with the importance of audienceeducation about the fallout world and the vault and the brotherhood of steel this was a fully terrible approachthe approach to creating a series like this should have been a more patient one aimed at the longterm since as with the actual game there is nothing that speeds along with much success in this sort of postapocalyptic world they should have allowed the lore of the world to reveal itself longterm naturally occuring along the journey of their vaultdweller but instead the typical hollywood vices went to work here and we end up with them trying to include so much lore on such short notice that the series ends up looking more like an advertisement or glorification of the game than its own strong product they should have taken an approach that put more emphasis on the survivalism aspects of an irradiated wasteland and the violent repercussions of human nature in such a desperate environment particularly considering the license they demonstrate with violence and sexuality throughout the series if audiences are watching this level of gore nudity and other mature content then surely at no point does the overall plot need to feel pg as it truly does with yet another young adultstyle plot revolving around daddy issues and infantile crushes that sort of thing feels like it belongs more in the hunger games and really theres no reason to try to sell this franchise on a younger demographic its strength is its demographic an entire generation of gamers who could easily influence succeeding generations of gamers and filmmakers alike with a successful production of this kind but the series just barely manages to keep its head above water that said im pleased to report at this early stage that aggregate scores here on imdb do appear quite high currently averaging around  and there seem to be a lot of satisfied viewers but we all know how the hype train goes and im a bit to much of a vet to fall for that so ill be realistic and say that after finishing the entire series in a twoday binge it is passable bordering on strong but far from masterful receiving an  from me for this season and keeping me interested enough to watch for the nextthat said it was a hell of a lot better than the  body problem from netflix which was kinda hopeless by comparisondespite a story that felt too much like a safe hollywood action script they did get a lot of things rightfirst and foremost massive kudos go to the young beautiful and preciously tiny ella purnell who was similarly excellent in s of yellowjackets the only other thing ive seen her in so far props to the production team for casting an interesting person as their lead something that sadly has been all too rare of late  indeed films and series of the current generation seem oversaturated with uninteresting actors and actresses who in many cases appear to be chosen because of the this trait of being uninteresting for the sake of making them more relatable but most often theyre not more relatable theyre just more boring here i glare at the little actress they put as the main character in the last of us who was literally so terribly uninteresting and unbelievable that she ruined the series so here im happy to report we have an interesting person to spend time with in glorious ella with her big expressive beautiful eyes the likes of mila kunisand here i want to say man does this kid they cast as maximus ever look like denzel washington its freakin uncanny he literally had to speak to convince me otherwise but damn could they ever cast this guy as denzels younger self in a film  you would literally be convinced it was cgi rejuvenation filters over top of the actual denzel same eyes and overall facial structure and even the build wasnt off by far and he did a good job and was interesting even if a bit emasculated meek and uncertain as is the current vogue for the many male characters played beside heroic females leads are these days you know with the whole slow and agonizing death of any male masculinity whatsoever in a world that has apparently deemed any such as toxic most notably on the silver screenalso notable was walton goggins perfomance as cooper he does a phenomenal job as a gritty westernstyle character basically playing a cowboy bounty hunter of the wasteland but here i also want to add that they went a little bit too heavy on the spaghetti western feel with the series though admittedly that sort of feel often does overlap the typical postapocalyptic lets face it even rick grimes felt like a cowboy in twd he played a great ghoul something i had been a tad worried about going into the series as i felt any sort of meaningful perfomance as such a creature would require very good makeup and effects and an equally talented actor and lo and behold as always walton goggins delivers i would say hes underrated but he isnt  bro has worked in some very fine films so clearly he gets the recognition he deserves hes great as the voice of cecil in the animated series invincible toothey really nailed a lot of the visuals the guns looked pretty good with the exception of the bos ar which was vastly oversized compared to in the game presumably to make it look like it belonged with the bulky bos power armor the mm pistol looked great though nice and hefty size they got the prydwen airship and vertibirds looking great as well the vault suits looked alright pretty accurate to the most recent fallout  most impressively they really nailed the vault interior walls vertically and horizontallysliding room doors but the main vault door which was basically a highlight in all the games the visual of which closing or opening held huge significance and was supposed to impact the viewerplayer deeply which it indeed did to those of us who adored the games even with so much design to drawn on throughout all the games was a huge disappointment the main vault door which is supposed to feel epic or monumental when being opened or shut is just kinda meh and sadly they even do try to focus some of the cameras attention on it as if trying to make a bit of effort and its still wholly underwhelming  this is basically inexcusable how can you make the graphics and visual impact of a huge production like this pale in comparison to graphics in games as old as  years or more oh wellthe lone robobrain was a tad disappointing as well didnt look anything like the ones in the games  was more just weird and more like a bit of an afterthoughtwe saw a couple of instances of the drug jet notably no use of the drug psycho and only a couple instances of use of the stimpak i felt like these should have been more prevalent and in the great cramfest that was the inept design choice of the series we left out entire crucial world elements and factions the raiders beyond appearing early on were not very raiderlike and were terribly misrepresented in the world basically as scarce as water in many cases moreso also lacking was any mention of the very prevalent cult in all of the fallout games the children of atom as well as other key groups that flavour the games such as the supermutants and talon company more understandably absent were any mention of the minutemen faction gunners faction the commonwealth and the institute since these appear on the eastern us seaboard whereas this series is based in california birthplace of the original fallout gamedidnt care much for the plot or the use of an absolute wealth of lore and assets it was good enough to be bingeable and good enough to recommend but not much to speak of beyond that there is nothing as groundbreaking here as it well should have been considering how groundbreaking the games were games that have inspired many clones such as atom rpg metro and underrail the former two are interesting as russian takes on postnuclear apocalypses and it should be mentioned here as well there is absolutely zero dispute that fallout as a whole took a great deal of its inspiration from george millers wonderous mad max series of films and the games even include mad maxs leather armor and mad maxs dog was the inspiration for the dog that appears as the only recurring character in all the fallout games the muchloved dogmeatlastly i appreciate what was done with the show in terms of embracing the whacky comedy and retrofuturism of the games and overall the series represented the spirit of the games well despite falling short of masterful storytelling and its maximum postapocalyptic potential
over the past few years much of popular scifi has disappointed fans by moving away from the stories they thought their favourite show or film represented i dont see it that way different writers have told different tales within a franchises framework  but those stories have been poor or too preachy enter fallout no pandering straight to business theres plenty action  a solid story to tell it does so whilst honouring the world already created and tells its tale with humour  grittyness with no compromises  a great female lead a ghoul a metal man  how much more inclusive do you need heh seriously everybody  everything is in here they just dont put anything in to hit some stupid benchmark of we have to represent this or that everything is in because it tells a great story if only disney  marvel  star wars understoodah well fallout represents what is great about scifi  when you have a great script a talented cast and the vision to entertain great things happen the show benefits from a decent budget and high quality production values making it must see tv cudos to amazon mgm studios  bethesda for making sure they got it right they deserve this to be huge so the competition could see how it should be done if you havent watched it yet indulge yourself highly recommended
zany dark lighthearted serious playful and most importantly violent and gory as hell i feel this show really captured the essence of the fallout game seriesstumble into a random buildingfind a vault full of mutants trying to reverse their mutation that were experiments of vaulttecfind a nice calm laketheres a vicious monster lurking beneath the depthscrossing a path with a few strangers that seem ready to be passiveno they are cannibals and want to eat youpsychotic robots that want to harvest your organssounds like falloutit really takes me back to the experience i had wandering through the wasteland in the games and how i never really knew what to expect in the next building i went intothe acting was solid story was solid and the room for future seasons setcompared to other amazon originals this one shines above the rest and the season finale really sold it for me the twist story conclusion and opening for more seasons we have room for exapnsionin addition the effects and cinematography one of my favorites was the scene where coop kills all the bos knights were incredible and i am hopeful that they will keep the same level of quality in future seasonsall in all i highly recommend it and wish that more shows went to the same lengths this one did on being true to its source
great adaptation i loved the games and this show does them justice while telling a great whimsical sad hilarious and engaging story in its own right i honestly did not think that amazon could pull this one offthe only reason i did not give it  stars is that it does not do the best job at building the world for people who have not engaged with the fallout universe previously new viewers will struggle to catch all the references and understand what is happening  this is not always necessary of course but sometimes the lack of exposition can cause confusion rather than add mystery and curiousitythe acting was phenomenal as well  this show made ella purnell one of my alltime favorite actresses and i do hope we get to see more of her in the future
side by side with the last of us in terms of the adaptation of a universe and a video game lore brought to the screen a simple story that introduces us to a quite complex universe many wellpresented characters that have a lot to give in future seasonsthe staging and visual effects are impeccable nothing to envy a multimilliondollar film productionin the wasteland you always deviate from your main mission for other thingsif you played the games some or all you will find millions of references and many things and details that pass very superficially will make more sense if you didnt its like the universe of westworld little by little the answers are comingthe location of the last scene wow
"what is happening with people that now we only have blood killing depression and horrors in every single tv showwhat is happening with the person who is sitting at home watching something so dark and depressing and is like wow this is so good i am going to recommend this show to everyoneevery show lately is similar  for all mankind foundation that started good and then ruined everything in second season baby reindeer westworld yellowstone as if people are not satisfied with depression and darkness from real world but they need to have it in their free time too i just dont understand
and i am definitely not a fan of this show even though all the actors are great"
i thought this was gonna flop after recent tv show adaptation from the avatars recent live action not living up to its precessor to the halo show being a huge flop from what ive heard this show changed my perspective on live action adaptations especially those originating from video game backgrounds such as resident evil and halo i shouldve known it would do better and learn from mistakes of other video games adaptations in recent televized history it seems that amazon prime is the only streaming platform properly using ips with the great adaptation hits such as invincible the boys and vox machina i trust that from this season alone i can trust amazon with a series from my childhood very close and dear to my heart ive put hundreds of hours into the fallout series alone and a  hours into the bethesda games all around so i went into this being very critical as its something personal to me and to my inner child and to see the lore and story being cared about and told i love it this is how you do a video game adaptation this is the fallout adaptation
of all the games i have only played fallout  and watched my husband play fallout  of which we were not fans but i have played fallout  an innumerable amount of times over the last  years and its absolutely my favorite video game of all time that being said i was expecting cheesy bad acting and a lot fan service but nothing of much value i dont know why thats what i was expecting maybe because people dont take video games too seriously so i thought this series from amazon studios would not be given the attention of something adapted say from a book but i was so wrong it is so heavy with that unique fallout feel from the games but its own original idea and yet still tying in with other details we know from the games and adding color and value to the games for a replay thinking about all we learned from the tv show that added to the canon the acting was amazing including great detail to make some of the extras behave like the hilarious npcs from fallout  the winks to things or situations you find while playing the games were done well amazingly wonderfully done fan service and of course loved hearing that music i have been jamming to in the commonwealth since i enjoyed the series very much i did have a hard time watching the gory parts that are very much a nod to the games but seeing live action verses animation was more jarring for me a person who definitely doesnt do horror in anyway i know that was to be expected in this series so its not a negative but something to add for someone who didnt think about that before watching the series like me why watched it before bed and then couldnt go to sleep
this show is certainly worth the watch way better than a lot of other stuff on i dont know the video game but this is a very well done postapocalyptic show well acted the scenery is fantastic very much a fan cant wait for morethe concept seems pretty simple bad things happen to seemingly good people pretty innocent girl to the rescue against the bad peoplei am a big fan of the postapocalyptic universe this one does not disappoint at all kudos to amazon prime videowalter goggins never disappoints as a bad guy i certainly enjoyed him and justified here in this show it is no differentnot as familiar with lucy parnell but she plays the innocent heroine very well
the story and screenplay are very tight and it will keep you at the notch during every episode ending the background story and the flashbacks are managed extremely well i am not a die hard fan of the game but its a very nice adaptation to that after the last of us this one i can definitely suggest this one to watchsome fight sequences between the t and ghoul can be made better but its a great show overall i will definitely wait for its nd season hope they will continue with the same pace and show some more background stories which left lot of uncovered partsand the timelines must be straight
this is in many ways great tv with plenty of absurd twists and lots of gore the scary thing is that this feels real like this is actually what we have to look forward to in our future kinda strange saying that since this is weird world with contradictions and characters that both feels out of place and right at home at the same timei played fallout  when that came out pretty good game but i am not really a fanboy or anything and never played anything before or after but from what i can tell this is pretty close to that game and we get a lot of nuggets of game hints lots of funny signs hanging on walls and a lot of tech directly game relatedalthough this is based on a postapocalyptic game and the show plays out in a ghoulish wasteland i get more fantasy vibes the hero need to gather a mcguffin and gather a team to go on a quest to find item a which will lead to the next quest and item b it sounds a bit formulaic and it sort of is probably my one big complaint that things move kinda linear and mostly one can figure out what will happen before it does i could also complain about a few details a few actors and a couple of storypoints are not hundred percent but at the end of the day this is very well made skyhigh production value with great music and interesting charactersthe contradictions with happy peppy people getting their limbs cut off and evil folk being kind and animals getting slaughtered in one scene and eaten in the next puppies incinerated while the doctor save another puppy it is all very strange and fits perfectly with the vibe of the games and the vibe of this showthe first season because there will be more is far better than most things on tv today yea it does not say so much because the competition is garbage but this is more than watchable this is good even great at times i give this a  and i am all for expanding on this universe give this a go even if you do not like everything this is definitely entertaining
i love fallout games best going around this series while standing on its own had many aspects to the games the story line is a newbie but many of the old towns buildings and people came to life i enjoyed it binged in one day walter goggins as usual is terrific all the cast did a great job somewhat violent but what post apocalyptic world isnt loved it watch it enjoy it ella purnell was great loved her in yellowjackets well worth your time and maybe just maybe go back and play the games for old times sake hope they have a second series of the tv show and another fallout game in the future but lets not wait  years or so
this show was amazing my husband and i have played all the fallout games and this showed nailed it the acting references music storyline all fit and they did such a great job bringing an amazing video game to life so many other video game adaptations fall short and maybe amazonmgm learned from those mistakes because what they created with bethesda games was truly amazing when youre watching the show and if youve played the games you get that weird sense of foreboding every time you watch someone walk into a new vault because you know what happens in the video gameanother great part of this show are the flashback scenes with one of the main characters they give you an amazing back story into vaulttecall in all this is a great show really well done and has everyone excited for whats coming next in season 
noseriouslythat wasnt a rhetorical questionwhat was that show i must confess that i only managed to put myself through three episodes of this atrocity before i could endure no more and gave up it has been a while since i have seen anything this bafflingly bad a big mess a disjointed cacophony passing as content imbued and drenched with all the modern day ideological tropes and virtue signaling bereft of anything resembling creativity or originality and more importantly qualityi honestly dont care about the video games i have no personal attachment to this ip was only marginally familiar with the lore so i approached this show as a newbie with no prior expectations therefore i am only looking at this as a series which i had hoped would be at least entertaining containing a good story and interesting characters none of that available here quite the oppositea waste of time and brain cells id like to say more but i feel my iq dropping when i spend any time thinking or talking about fallout
i wont lie after rings of power i was concerned but rings of power grew on me once i watched it and this was amazing binged it within  days it stays true to the setting and is fairly realistic when it comes to the wastelandnow i do think the vault tech story is a bit of a stretch but it is awesome we all knew vault tech wasnt good from the start and this really does add on a whole new layer to that dynamicneedless to say i think everyone was impressed from the start and we all look forward to a season  which it definitely deserves if it doesnt take another decade to makehopefully
last thing i want is to rate a show based on something i like because a bad review could mean cancellation so  stars it is im seeing to much disney influence in the story and casting i wouldve preferred the first vault dweller to be male and funny but hey sex sells walter goggins scored on this one hell become a household name playing the ghoul not many kids watch sons justified or diamonds lol hes bringing more entertainment to the screen anyways but we didnt need another fin from star wars one was good enough its like they cloned ha his story and personality another poor crying storm trooper anyways keep the show going maybe itll get better in season  like halo
while watching the show i am thinking of that hows about whole rules of starting of humanity remove this world  i like dystopias universes but this show so clearly exhibit to the profits of factors without humanity so while this doing using some arguments one of these is s communismcapitalism war its seems like americans no have any problem except for this in this time i think that could contains more somethings ussr or china other things there are some communities in the show but except vaulter none of the others no explains of their historyall in all this show has a beautiful screnio and universe definitely able to watch actors are good the images are good and the effects are nicely done maybe if told of before the big war it was better
i keep seeing reviews here with relatively low scores i dont get it maybe youre someone that hasnt played the game and doesnt get the show maybe you were expecting something else but i will say this this is fallouti dont consider myself a die hard fan of the fallout franchise in fact i havent even played fallout  this show is by far the best adaptation i have seen on screen from content out of a video gamethis is what fallout is meant to be it has the essence of the games there is even a line by the ghoul that says its difficult to get anything done without getting sidetracked that is pure fallout right therethe music is amazing i dont want to set the world on fire is a classic the gore the scenery the barren wasteland it is all therewhat else can i say if you have even casually played some of the games like me you will love thisthis is my first ever review on imdb and i just wanted to say that we need more content like this on tv if we ever get a mass effect tv show even if its a fraction of how good fallout is it will be worth watching
great set pieces music that calls out to the video game great acting humorous at times just like the gamei have had a blast with this show it does a good job of using the lore and feel of the game only critique i can give is the pacing can be off at times but not enough to take me out of itim not sure why people who supposedly played the game hate it so much i think they did a great job of adapting the game to the screen i put many hours into the game and feel like they did a fantastic job of recreating the best parts of the gamei think people need to realize that an adaption doesnt have to be  pure to the source material to still be good as long as its well written im there either way
i cant think of anything missing i watched this in one breath and only wished that it continuedit is always hit and miss with adaptations typically their greatest challenge is to accurately recreate the tone and atmosphere of the source material often times only some of the crew really get it and are passionate while others waste too much time trying to cater to imaginary expectations of the fans and mass appeal based on a trailer i was only cautiously optimisticim happy to say that the show surpassed all my expectations and was excellent in all aspects from casting to recreating the world body past and future to humor and art directiontop quality entertainment in the sea of mass produced mediocrity
although i havent actually played the games but from what ive heard from those who have the show has done a beautiful job in adapting the games universe fortunately fallout is the kind of show you do not need to be familiar with the origins of to enjoy it is well made the storytelling is really firm and keeps you hooked the characters are portrayed quite good and you can easily connect with them the humor is also acceptable and makes you laugh every now and thenthe only issue i have with the show is that it would be much greater if there were some high points included throughout the show from start to end the show mostly in the same level of good i mean the story does not peak or a major event does not occur the good thing here is that this means the show doesnt lose its touch at any point and keeps the good quality you can easily realize this from the episodes ratings which do not vary much and mostly in the same rangeanyways i really loved and enjoyed the first season and would love to see more peeks in the seasons to come
reviewing a video game adaptation presents challenges because they are except for halo apparently intended to honor the fandom and the original game this series does that to a degreethe set designs cgi except for the gulp monsters and production quality are all very good and who doesnt enjoy a good old villain performance by walton goggins hes greatella purnell despite the fact that shes saddled with a mary sue role is also very good projecting just enough fish out of water humor and surviving by the skin of her teeth as central character lucy her standard response says it all okey dokeyunfortunately aside from those two there are many miscast ineffective performers led by aaron moten as maximus the renegade knight and moises arias as norman lucys brother there are several small bit parts that are well done but they are few and far betweenthe writing all over the place a lot of the overarching story does come from the game but there are enough bizarre and gratuitous plot lines that by the end of the sixth episode it all begins to fall apart the tonal shifts between overheated melodrama the fifties flashbacks to the hokey spoof of life in the vaults to the uber violent present day quests through the badlands on the surface do not serve the viewer wellbecause they handle their roles well the episodes that feature lucy purnell and the ghoul goggins can be fun to watch until gratuitous weird crap starts happening but maximus story is harder to watch until he joins up with lucy because moten is so bad that it takes the viewer out of the story every time his story is also so close to john boyegas as a defecting storm trooper in the force awakens that his performance suffers in the comparison he takes himself so seriously and his expression changes so seldom that it doesnt mesh with anything going on around himthen there are the frequent plot problems the all powerful knight suit can be deactivated by anyone who unscrews the batteryfusion core from the back of the suit really wouldnt the armor have some safety features to protect the knights from that that are the result of unimaginative writers one of the biggest oddball issues is that all of the squires who are being trained to serve the knights as schlepperspack animals are all skinny unhealthy looking toothpicks dumbwhen you finish watching a series especially one that ends with an open ended story line you should be anxiously awaiting the next installmentnope not here
whether you are a die hard life long fallout fan like me or your introduction to the series is this show you are going to be completely hooked chalked full of fan service and lore its a fallout fans dream this show will bring new fans to the games and welcome them to a world worth exploring and delving into fallout  is a long way out but this hits all the beats of filling that vault boy shaped hole in your heart acting directing writing cinematography all are firing on all cylinders intense gory funny nervewracking at times heartbreaking there are a lot of words to describe fallout but one word stands tall perfection
fallout  is one of my favorite video games of all time so i was cautiously optimistic when i heard about a tv adaptation but this time amazon and mgm knocked it out of the park its no small feat to adapt a game like fallout to a realworld environment that is believable while still paying attention to the little bits of gameplay that made it fun at the same time the writers were able to weave a storyline that is cohesive but also explores many themes from the series walton goggins absolutely nails his role as the ghoul and ella purnell does a great job as the protagonisti hope we dont have to wait years for a second season while the finale wraps up the season storyline in a satisfying way it still leaves us all wanting more fallout
great goggins finally something truly worthwhile watching if there is ever going to be a show that reverses second screen and scroll watching this must be the templateexcellent character driven stories perfect casting beautiful set designs and wardrobestanding ovation to everyonethe only fault it seems weve got a long wait before season  something that appears to be symptomaric of amazon shows not helped by the writers strike nk doubt but amazon does have previous here the boys invincible wheel of time which is very meh imo and their lotr effortplease give us more
as huge fan from fallout  through new vegas and fallout  multiple times across multiple platforms to fall out  i was sceptical about another game to tv show interpretation but fallout the tv does not disappoint at all the attention to detail is amazing down to the chems and stimpaks all the way to the power armour and bethesdas comedic in game humour the show captures and embodies everything about the game i as a fan love and i hope there are many more seasons of fallout to come choice of actors was spot on walter coggins is the perfect pic acting itself was just right and again captures the in game style of voice play in the characters in game the wasteland landscapes and towns in said wasteland are exactly how you would want as a game fan honestly couldnt recommend this show enough and it would also appeal to people who have never played the games and would hopefully lead them to then going on to play and enjoy the vast world that is fallout solid outing from bethesda and amazons first collab
fallout is not just a game its a certain tone it mixes ultra violence with a post apocalyptic retrofuturistic satirical take on the greatest generationits clever storytelling which is difficult to get right fallout  fallout  and fallout new vegas are the best games in the series and has since  set the staple of what fallout can bewith huge setbacks for fallout fans with fallout  and amazon failing rings of power i had no hopes for this series at allthe fallout tv series however absolutely nails it it has the exact right tone pulls no punches with ultra violence has its own unique characters and s sci fi scientific madnessthe actors are all fantastic the style perfect and the story engaging it sets the tone after just  minutes and tells a story the story of fallout no bull just plain falloutthis is amazing as a massive fallout fan since fallout  in  i have to say my hat is off and i will be enjoying this tremendously
"what an amazing series me and my partner are both gamers and loved fallout  and  so we were excited to watch this and it definitely did not disappoint the attention to detail  clearly large budget spent incorporation of art work and locations from the game were outstanding a must watch for bethesda fans cant wait for the next season hopefully it wont be too far in the future really dont understand the butt hurt super nerd fans please dont get this cancelled with the negativity like you did resident evil netflix series 😭
credit especially to ella purnell and walter goggins i found their acting to be superband dogmeat ofc 🐶"
"i like to let my review because im a huge fan of fallout i play it since fallout  and i love the history characters and ambiance sopros
the scenery is amazing the ambience is also awesome 👏👏👏👏👏walton goggins ghoul was so great and sanguinary fallout in his veinsthe secondary characters was really cool too the guys from shelters was great the shelters it selfe was really greatcons
lucy ella purnell is toooooooo silly please see that im talking about the character not the actress she is great the character only shoots with that little tranquilizer dart gun that never existed in the game the game is shooting and bombing all the time they could have at least used a bb gun then  shes very oh my god are you going to kill this guy oh i really have to attack this guy why are you so aggressive bro fallout is shooting and blood all the time and she doesnt want to be aggressive i didnt understand anything she took about  episodes and still doesnt understand that everyone wants to kill you in the world of fallout 😂😂 common its not the behavior of a main character of a fallout game
i doesnt understand the series are very bloody as the game but she doesnt want to fight to kill everyone🤦🤦🤦maximus aaron clifton is very slow please see that im talking about the character not the actor the fact of he doesnt know how to use power armor is ok but i thought he was too slow to fight i dont knowokay ill be honest i kind of gave up watching it because of them two and worse than that i was drooling to see the series it was a dream come true to see fallout as a series😢😢"
ive been a long time fan of the game series but this could be a show about anything theres very little that feels like fallout crappy corny dialogue that is completely out of place for an underground society that hasnt seen the surface or been exposed to any new popular culture for nearly  centuriesi had high hopes but they fell flat after the opening bomb drop sequence and only got worse from therei gave it a fair crack as i watched  episodes but i couldnt tolerate it any longerwhy are video games adapted to the screen so poorly only the witcher has been up to par and even then the second series was mediocre
when i heard of this that several thousands of gaming time would translate into a tv series iwas very happy the closer it came to today my fears slightlu grew what if it was awful and a mess up  today i´m no longer afraid after seeing  straight episodes this was even more wonderful than i could have imagined the feeling was there the clonk of the power armour was spot on and all the songs a listened to for a zillion hours was there i have not been this happy since my kids were born i just want to raise a glass to all of the perfect actors doing this so much justice and to mr nolan för delievering a christmas treat in april if you ever played the game this is your show and if you haven´t you probably might like it anyways thank you amazon
i have to say this is the best adaptation tv show to a video that k have ever seen all i can say is if amazon decides to do more it will not disappointi am one who tends to not fall in love with tv shows that are adaptations of games this one hits it out of the park to the thrilling fights to the quirky songs and nuances from the s it always makes one come back for morethe character building is done really well the show takes you through each characters backgrounds and gives you snippets of their past that makes you come back for more moreover the budget for the tv series is one really well the cgi and costumes dont feel fake
"
by far the best gaming adaptation show i have ever seen the plot was incredibly well written and executed the characters especially the ghoul were badass the only thing i will say is that it lacks some of the monsters from the game like i wanna see rat moles etc just pop out but hey this is only the first season i hope they release s soon so they could add more to the next one who knows this show is most definitely up there with breaking bad on my listoverall  this show has made me redownload fallout  and currently now replaying it"
ive seen plenty of amazing tv series and movies in my lifetime but never ever have i watched something done so incredibly well like fallout is this tv series is just the best this is better than star wars lord of the rings its better than game of thrones better than the avengers its better than anything everything has been curated so well the caracters the scenery the special effects the script the camera the actors the episodes lenght and format the fantastic way in which they stayed true to the games and recreated the fallout world perfectlythis is the best thing you will ever watch and the only negative thing about it is that its only  episodes because i need another  episodes of this stuff at the very least and you will need another  episodes too after watching it you can trust me on that
fallout is my favourite gameseries ever starting with fallout  never finished fallout tactics tough this tvseries stayed amazingly true to the feeling i love with the games will probably rewatch it next weekendyou get to experience the world again with fresh eyes just like any game starts characters felt like they each had their s p e c i a l stats suitable distributed and clear personal morals intrigues are both heartbreaking and over the top cooky as it should be my fear was that the wackiness would be the main focus i am extremely impressed with how the team balanced iti want more but i hope the team takes the time it needs to continously produce this quality i do not want tired actionpacked scifi western with oneliners i want more fallout season  which is great thank you for taking this to the screen in a manner that makes a diehard fan happy
im not even finished with the final  episodes left of the first season but i still have this to say its amazing the producers and show creators did a perfect job of bringing the world of fallout to life i truly felt the same joy watching this show as i felt when i first played fallout  they stayed true to the world and gave us what we wouldve wanted had we had a decision in making it they picked such a good cast goggins and purnell absolutely killed their roles its an exciting ride and has the perfect touch of comedy when necessary gotta say it turned out much better than most probably couldve imagined it would im excited to see more seasons
as a huge fan of the first few games this show absolutely nails the feel of the game after watching the show i come to the reviewratings and was astounded that anyone could say anything bad about this showeach of the leads played their part perfectly goggins is fantastic as the ghoul  as cooperthey nailed the cult factions from the game while telling multiple new storylinesit was refreshing to see a show game translate into a good tv show there were many twists and turns while paying respect to the games with tons of easter eggs for the diehards they werent afraid to go to a very creepy and dark place on many frontsepisode  paid off extremely well while setting up for another season perfectlyid recommend the show to anyone regardless of not knowing the video game as long as they can handle some squeamish violence
i had to create an account to express my anger at this adaptation i will applaud it on its visuals but i cannot give a dime for its writing nor canonicity if youve never played a fallout game before or casually played fallout then yes i can safely recommend this show for you as on its own is entertaining and is capable of being a satisfying watch excluding some of the bad writing which could bother you however if you are one of those people whove been interested in fallouts world for a long time then theres a high chance youll be disappointed by how bethesda changes fallouts west coast lore to retcon levelsonto my criticisms i mentioned the bad writing of which i can tell you two cases of one in episode  and another in  the first problem i had is with its introduction to our trouble apparently vault s inhabitants had been all killed by a group of raiders who then dressed as them and yet nobody in vault  was able to recognize during their trading session that these people looked nothing like the original inhabitants of the people they frequently contacted for trade and in episode  alongside with its depiction of the brotherhood accepting outsiders into its ranks which it never did outside of fallout  and even they had a major problem with it the plot becomes suspiciously convenient by having the brotherhood knight act like a brutish idiot and land in the middle of nowhere just so they could stumble upon the leftovers of one of the other main characters onto the canonicity of the show its egregious the ncr is destroyed for some reason in  even though it was shown in new vegas the ncr was still alive and well in  and now their remnants have turned into a crazed cult ghouls are once again depicted as being able to survive without needing to drink or eat i blame fallout  for this the brotherhood for some reason conscripts outsiders whilst simultaneously being religious technology hoarders and they no longer act isolationist this is not okay because these guys arent some excommunicated off shoot of the brotherhood they are the head of the organizationseriously i wouldve given this show a  if i didnt care so much about the original games but because i hate bethesda so much i cannot give an ounce of support to this series in my eyes it failed
will  by far that was the most perfect video game show ive seen in a while i was a bit hesitant about it after watching the first episode and knowing that the show it self is not taking it self seriously it was very light and gritty and captured the tone and aesthetic really good  one nitpick tho how would a scribe kill a yao guai in  shots to the head it took me a full clip of the energy rifle so whats up with that amazon  also the transition of the setting to the mohavie and new vegas give a really good thing about whats coming next i have really high expectations for the next step
i was expecting this to flop ive played all fallout games since  besides  there was no possible way the people behind rings of power could get something as nuanced as fallout lore right right gave it a chance because i love walton goggins they blew this out of the water i cannot believe how good it is not in a million years this is a much watch for not only game fans but newcomers as well the finale was hugely impactful when fans of the series see the final scene they will go nuts please hurry season two if i have one slight disappointment a very minor disappointment it would be the lack of super mutants but i love the characters so much ill give that a pass and remain hopeful for the next season
i was hoping for this show to be good but i was mistaken this show came out perfect man i cannot wait for season  im excited everything in this show was good the music was incredible the acting the cgi and ofcourse the storyline i would write a review on that but i think i would just end up spoiling it for people who havent finished it yet in my opinion this show is one of the good film adaptation video games i have ever seen it was absolutely better than i expected it to be ive been a diehard fallout fan for years and when i heard about the franchise getting a film adaptation i was pretty thrilled but honestly i gotta admit i was a bit scared scared that this show might end up being sucked like some of the other video game film adaptations but again i was mistaken this show came out amazing im excited for season 
this is the best thing that i have watched on amazon prime that they have created so far it stayed very loyal to the source material just finished watching the first season going to rewatch the whole season a few times  out of  stars only wish is for next season to have more robots and more of the beasts of the wasteland like the supermutants and deathclaws hopefully we get to see the mojave wasteland chapter of the brotherhood of steel next season amazon should really consider putting more money into the fallout franchise and create one or two spinoffs smaller stories that are loyal to the source material i would even take a reboot all of the fallout nuka break youtube series but on amazon
never played the games so i cannot say if its story is accurate nevertheless really enjoyed watchingevery scene contains cool shotsi really enjoy this kind of post apocalyptic type of seriesthe different storylines playing at once kept it interesting to watchthe ghoul played by actor walton goggings was a perfect castthe music choice was spot on aswellwithout spoiling the final episode i really am looking forward to the next season and i cannot wait until its releasethe movie deserves an it made me interested in playing the games and the entire ´fallout´ storyline
i mean this show is good the main character looks like a young emma stone and its literally like watching a game unfold in front of your eyes the very first episode grasps the twisty tourney adventure that is the wasteland in its core ive had to stop myself from watching it because it got too late and i needed to go to sleep also im not one for watching a series more than once but im probably gonna be watching this again luckily michael rappaport is only in one episode for like  seconds because recently hes shown that he is only worth being in a show for  seconds so thats a spoiler i guess ill end with that
"its everything that i wanted from the fallout showits beautiful every building looks like its straight out of the game every chem food loved that i got to see inside a yum yum devilled egg box i love the details clothing item prop everything is beautifulots amazong i love the music and everythingi love lucys little brother so much cant wait to see more of everyone in season twovegas baby yeahhhhhhhhhhhmore nore more moreseriously the attention to detail is absolutely amazing its visually stunning and the music is so fun i love the editing good job editor good job everone moreseason two

"
i couldnt finish the first two episodes and quit they created a world but the world has literally our modern culture with some scififantastic creatures the characters are stupid and the writing is so off in the first episode they dont want to touch or be around outsiders and in the second episode the main girl walks around and wants to shake strangers hands all characters are literally stupid but they look like they tried creating funnygoody characters but its an epic fail time wasting i wish i could get my time back whoever voted this series high is the reason for my wasted time
this this is how a game to tv adaptation is done absolutely phenomenal series loved it from start to finishthe attention to detail was spot on from the tvs to the stimpaks including the game music too just made it even better i binged watched it over two nights and will undoubtedly will watch it a few more timescharacters were sensational the ghoul character was simply brilliantamazon and bethesda have hit a home run with this i hope and pray that there will be a second series and moreit has also reignited my love for the fallout games and im revisiting fallout  new vegas  and  again
excellent show all around for fans of the game and non fans alike its a incrediblely faithful adaptation but still feels fresh and theres an incredible attention to detail thatll give fans a lot to look out for it almost feels like youre in the game at certain times as theyve really captured the look and feel of fallout i think itll definitely get a bunch of people jumping back into game as i am doing so myself the acting is good enough all around and walton goggins is excellent as usual the effects look great and the sound design as well as the soundtrack are phenomenal too the plot is interesting and although its fresh story itll seem very familiar to fans of the game its darkfun and full of gore contains sex scenes and nudity but doesnt even seem excessive cheap or exploitative honestly just all around great experiences and definitely worth binging in one go
im a binge fiend if i buy a whole block of chocolate it wont survive the car ride home from the shop i cant help myself so i buy two in the case of a great tv series such as fallout there is no secondsthis series should have been released weekly to allow us to lust and pine over it with fellow fans between indulgences i barely played the game so dont know the story from which the fallout tv series is derived i dare say i didnt need to because this story quality for me stands alone so amazon should treat shows this good with the respect and currency they holdi ask that if amazon decision makers read this post they take it as advice for season two to think about how a similarly pitched customer market for a story from competitor apple released a very good but not as great a series as fallout is called silo that went as a weekly release apple would have done this with fallout and we would all eat it up give something to appreciate a streaming service we pay good money for quality over garbage quantitywhilst youre at it amazon give fallout a bigger budget to let us explore the details of the vast surface dwelling environment and vaults if course through the lenses of the characters with more freaky characters and monsters too please but at least give us something to look forward to each week rather than the sugar dump
yes im a fanboy and a huge fallout fan this show pays homage to all of the games there is something for everyone who loves the story but this is just a great showat a time when disney is getting away with  minute shows and destroying their fan base thank you for making an actual hour long show with a good new story based in a world that is well established masterfully woven so that at the end you get it tied up with an open door to continue onim a huge walter goggins fan so many call backs to great westerns in this show and he play the best bad misunderstood good guy best actors they did a marvelous job with what they were given i cant wait till the next season
as a huge fan of the video games i was hoping this would be great and it was it must be challenging to  satisfy all the fanboys like me and  satisfy people who have never played fallout the creators obviously studied the lore loads of little easter eggs in there and my wife loved it who has never played fallout  in fact hates the game as she has observed me spending hours roaming the wastelands commiting atrocities 🤣 what i found most impressive is they got the whole fallout vibe correct it should actually be a dark horror game an apocalyptic wasteland with giant cockroaches mutants horrible deaths yet the game always injected so much dark humour it made light of the situation and made it fun the show does this as well with so many disappointing adaptations of classic games or books in the last few years resident evil rings of power halo to name a few where the creators just threw away the lore and did there own thing fallout gets it right theres enough in thier for fans and enough in there for newbies the acting and script are no masterpiece but why should it be its good enough if you want a grade acting and scripts theres oppenheimer etc fallout is supposed to be a dark comedy set in a messed up world and it does just that
i just finished the season  finale of fallouti feel like i need to go back through all of my imdb ratings where i awarded a  and lower them to  this series is a game changerthis was not just one of the best video game adaptations ive ever seenthis was not just one of the best debut seasons of a television series that ive ever seenthis was quite frankly astonishingcome for the coal minedark humor stay for the engaging performances walk away mesmerized by the indepth world building the heartbreaking twists and turns and the agony of knowing that you will have to wait at least a year to see what happens nextamazon prime has finally at long last found its game of thrones but fallout has the potential to eclipse that series okie dokie
amazon and the entire crew here nailed it im a huge fallout fan of the game for decades and was not expecting this wow incredible i wanted to watch all  episodes at once bravo genius lets ink another  seasonslucy is wonderful she is the perfect naive vault dweller maximus is not what youd expect from a brotherhood of steel member but he is excellent the ghoul top notch mr goggins was born for this role he is john wayne and clint eastwood with a little mel gibson mad max all perfectly joinedi will watch this several more times to catch all the hidden gems like the mention of maximus in the copter saying something about tempering alloy on the power armor a mod in the game that i missed the first timegamers will love this non gamers just watch it you will really be glad you did
i love the fallout series i started playing fallout  when it launched and i was just a teenager then i have the fondest memories of any game ive ever played with fallout  having spent hundreds of hours in the game which provided some of the most cherished memories i look back upon i was so immersed in that universe that for years i searched online for more content or something similar that could help me relive that time again this show really does that it took me back to being the same teenager who could not tear his eyes away from the screen playing the game for hours on end and now ive watched the entire show in one stretch thank you to everyone who made this possible ive been following this show since amazon prime dropped the teaser years ago and im so glad its everything i expected i love fallout and even though im older now this is the series that has immersed me the most in almost a decade
my lord im a gamer my wife not both of us found this show captivating  days it took to complete thats including me off for  hours for a major business meeting   we are already clucking for the next instalment  well written fantastic actors all of them story is addictive effects amazing we conclude star wars mandalorian mad max and walking dead mixed to create what we hope is ever lasting  longer than walking dead episodes and something we can follow until we die my lord  keep them coming do not give up pass the baton to your kids  just keep them coming please x
gamers and movie adaptations of games have always had a rocky relationship we appreciate angelina for tomb raider uncharted was fun mindless action with subpar casting assassins creed waswell we try not to remember it seemed as though the video game curse were doomed to repeat itself until we were blessed with craig mazins the last of us beautiful stories jaw dropping sets and amazing performances from the lead actorsi thought to myself itll probably be another  years before we get a decent adaptation like that i couldnt be happier to be wrong fallout doesnt demand your attention its struts its stuff and you cant help but watch the cast is amazing the story is gripping the violence is bloody fantastic literally and the choice to make the soundtrack a blend of music from different fallout games is just a perfect little maraschino cherry on topi dont really understand the two reviews that are hating on it to each their own but this series is amazing and deserves a fair chance absolutely amazing and i cant wait to see more amazon is killing it this year
the series is created off of the game it sticks to the games originality and quirkiness whilst having its own originality twists and turns throughout the storyline the actors are fantastic honestly the comedy innocence gore ruthless quirky plot twists to this series thats off beat but absolutely stunning when the last episode ended it have wasted one of my  gene wishes for another  series in a rowif amazon are sending out fund raisers for a second series ive got £ in my pocket knock on my door and its yoursthe nolan brothers cant do any wrong at the moment can they
so been playing the fallout games for roughly a decade or so been through fallout  new vegas  and even  love the games so much i have a vault boy tattooed on my armhonestly i went into this show with the lowest of expectations the history of games becoming shows has been shaky at best besides last of us of course i braced for disappointment gotta say fraking love this damn show i always have bloody mess running and the splatter factor was very on pointthe peace in the show lasts a whole  minutes like the games before things go horribly wrong so very on brand love seeing all the realistic versions of vertibirds yao guais power armor gulpers brahmin could be a little more radiated looking but i can forgive itgoggins is perfect and can do no wrong he kills it in his role all the other characters are awesome too but im only  episodes in stoked to see where the series goes loving the subtle and notsosubtle references to the game there were points where i couldnt help but say fraking side quests and laugh at how the story was goingits a great time to watch yeah i could sit and nitpick every little thing but why i like the story it reminds me of fallout it respects the game and gamers who play it funny in the right ways and appropriately inappropriate in the level of gore which i was hoping they would do
if you like it great keep watching it i honestly dont care im just gonna list off reasons why i dont like loving a series that seems to be retconningresetting all the past things theyve created for something new that seems lame or same old clicheapparently the ncr isnt around anywhere in cali im  episodes in and i havent seen a trace of them in any society function its only been  years since nv they would be like roman empire broken but into pieces more than anything nope its just people in tin shacksturning the bos into this edgy london knightlord theme yes their titles are knightelderscribeetc however ive never once seen them have dialogue like this show does its hammered into them since either birth in the bunkers or if were going east coast then since they joinim not crazy of lucy being the center not cause shes a bad actor but because i would of enjoyed her more if they simply either gave her smaller lines or mute to transition a rpg character almost just being dragged along in the story like most dothe writing is basic people act like this is masterpiece writing but it isnt theyve done the fathersondaughter thing now  timesfallout  and now this show its getting old oh but guess what the vaults waterchip is busted where else have i seen thisthe world is bland feels like they spent most of the budget on actorscostumes and thats about it theres one settlement if you wanna call it that and its somehow worse than megaton again in cali where ncr had a full fledged nation happening
where do i even begin with this disaster of a tv series fallout is an absolute travesty that manages to squander every ounce of potential it had from the poorly written dialogue to the laughable special effects its clear that the creators had no clue what made the original video game franchise so belovedlets start with the acting or lack thereof the performances are so wooden and uninspired that youd think the cast was made up of department store mannequins not even the most talented actors could salvage the atrocious script they were given every line feels forced and devoid of any emotion leaving viewers cringing in their seatsand dont even get me started on the production quality the sets look like they were thrown together in someones backyard complete with cheap props and shoddy costumes the cgi is so bad that its almost comical with mutant creatures resembling poorly rendered blobs rather than terrifying monstrositiesbut perhaps the most unforgivable sin of fallout is how it completely misses the mark on capturing the essence of the video games gone is the sense of exploration and discovery replaced instead with mindnumbingly dull plotlines and tedious exposition its as if the creators took everything that made the games great and tossed it out the window in favor of generic postapocalyptic clichésin conclusion fallout is a train wreck of a tv series that should be avoided at all costs save yourself the agony and stick to playing the video games instead at least then youll have some semblance of enjoyment amidst the nuclear fallout of this abysmal adaptation
damn this tv show frustrated me so so much potential i really truly thought they were going to deeply explore the fascinating politics the vault experiments corruption monopoly economics etc then came the final episode which appeared to have been written solely to wrap everything up and create a new arena of brotherhood vs new california for season  it was written so poorly that half of the wrap up points didnt make any sense so vault tec destroyed the entire earths economy just to gain monopoly power over said economy despite already being the world dominating monopoly how is that profitable by bombing the entire earth youve destroyed literally all the physical and human resources which drive production of all earths goods and services nobody is paying vault tec membership fees anymore once their home is bombed and theyre forced underground into the vaults costing vault tec money how disappointing that something that had such potential was ended so poorly will not return for season 
while fallout had the potential to be an engaging series with its rich postapocalyptic setting and intriguing plot it is significantly marred by its overreliance on graphic violence the shows frequent and graphic depictions of violence often feel gratuitous overshadowing the storyline and character developmentthe gore in fallout is not just present it is pervasive and at times extreme making it difficult to watch for those who are sensitive to such content this overemphasis on brutality can alienate viewers who might appreciate the narrative or the worldbuilding aspects of the series its disappointing that the creators decided to lean so heavily into these elements as the show could have been captivating without such intense and graphic scenes
as a long time fallout fan i was really looking forward to this show having seen all of it now im not really disappointed but let down if youve never played any of the games i think this show will be of great interest to anyone who likes science fiction but for those of us who are dedicated fans hundreds of hours in  and new vegas and thousands of hours in  this show will miss the mark but really only slightly everything youd expect to be in this show is here but the tone is off everyone is very happygolucky for too long into the season and serious moments are always cut with some sort of humor i would encourage everyone to watch and judge for themselves but go in with tempered expectations
ive played some video games in my life fallout not being one of them i understand how fans of the game are happy to see it as a series they keep saying how much it looks like the game and how its artistically accurate but is that it shouldnt things happen clearly when you turn a game into a series or movie a reviewer said its more fun to watch someone play the game than watch this i completely agree i watched the first episode and didnt feel like watching the second i started the second episode and waited bored until  thirds into it before something happened we dont get time to know the main characters and they just wander around saying lame dialogs one cannot even compare this to the last of us series which has humor action and characters you care about and really good script fallout tried to include cameos by familiar faces to make up for how lame this show is but even walton goggin or michael rapaport cant save this watch walton goggin in justified where hes given a good script and be amazed as for this fallout i mean strikeout im done with it cant wait for the second season of the last of us
those who worked on the props the sets the costumes and those who tried their best to act hard for this deserve applausethe writers however should have been locked in a room with a few copies of fallout  and not allowed near a word processor till they understood the setting properly or learned how to write satisfying narrative and well made charactersvideo game adaptations can be great castlevania for example was a case of beautifully constructed writing characterisation and faithfulness to a fanbase and setting that was rewarded with adoration by the fans myself included this was not thati watched the entire thing this felt like a show written by people who had a vague idea and exposure to what fallout is but who were ultimately awful at writing characters you want to see more of goggins ghoul does his best to save the showthey scattered endless member berries throughout the show to evoke reactions of dontcha remember this from the game oh look he said war never changes dontcha remember that that power armour was cool wasnt it its gratuitous and overbears the entire show because its the only way to hide the sheer foul stench from the writingthe power armour was coolit looks like fallout it sounds like fallout it smells like something dogmeat left for you
"first i am a gamer huge eldarscrolls fan for years huge rpg fan love scifihowever i will be upfront and say i played a bit of fo and thought it was a bit crap to be honest horrid interface lacked good mod support like oblivion and the endless knives and forks and microwave parts oh and its a personal opinion but i hate the s retro sci fi thingwhy do i say this to be upfront this has such good reviews i thought id put my biases behind me and give it a shotwell where do i starta guy survives an impossible gunfire situation
why was the gun therewhy did it seem to do very little to the buildingwhy did it even shoot at himand i guess more importantly how the f did he and his dog survivetone all over the place and horribly inconsistent
maybe its trying to be funny i have even heard the worries dark and satirical well lets just say gervais doesnt have to worry about any competition any time soon its isnt funnyeffects vary a lot general scenery is often good the pink lake monster utter shtewhy was there stereotypical ash shape humans you know the ones after a nuclear fire right outside the vault that have apparently been untouched and suffering no erosion after  yearswhy does the idiot and annoying squired gadget just happen to be able to instantly track the ghoul right when it was convenientwhy is maximus such an idiot why leave his armour un hidden for anyone to nick why leave the giant gun behind why leave his supplies behind why reveal himself to his squire after treating him like absolute crap his character needs to die quicklythe power armour not bad but that entrance into the settlement as in the trailer omg bad and cheesy doesnt even touch ithow does a ninja kick suddenly allow you to knock a robot saw away looked pretty sturdy to me
 oh yeah and with a severe foot injury that seemed to just conveniently disappearoh and i know its the whole retro theme thing but seriously that doesnt mean the vault overseas and the people living there have to be completed stupidif they screw up k this bad im gunna be real upset"
played fallout  and new vegas and enjoyed them alot years ago but wouldnt call myself a diehard or purist fan so thought id essentially be the perfect target audience for this showapparently i was very very wrongthis show feels like its trying to mimic about  different movies to create the effect of good tv but it misses the mark so so hard and comes across as uninspired cheesy and so so cliche there is not a hint of actual style or artistry in this every scene involves some shallow character overtly state some defining characteristic of themself over some emotional music and maybe slow motion before something bad happens to them which you inevitably dont care about because the character in question has no depth and the thing that happens is so hyperbolic overly dramatic and honestly stupid that you are sat there cringing in your seatwatched episode  and definitely dont feel the need to watch anymore jesus christ amazon sort yourself out
very decent cast some awesome settings others quite poor with cardboard characters and a penchant for senseless grotesquery that serves no narrative purposethey completely forgot that a videogame player is an active agent and one not very demanding storywise that a videogame rushed narrative will eventually not translate very well into an engaging scriptand thus yet another plastic concoction of our times the devastation we see onscreen reflects directly the barren wasteland of script writing for a majority of large budget productionsthe loud noise and blood splatter equates with the clueless show runners tossing failed ideas in the recycle binand time time utterly lost by way of mediocre storytellingit does seek some kind of redemption in the very last episode too little too latedigest and forget or avoid at all
as a woman and a non game fan i wouldnt recommend this show it is made well but has nothing in it i want to see it is essentially the game turned into a tv show but that doesnt mean i will want to see any of it some examples from the first two shows the main character alleged to be a spoiled girl essentially has sex with a raider criminal under false pretenses has her father kidnapped and her response go out into the very scary world to get him back um that is what a character in a game does no girl has those reactions soon we are introduced to a character that has his foot taken clear off and dies from the bleeding and what does this girl do removes his head as he asked right as you do there is no humanity in this show just game characters and thus no one to root for
as soon i saw that they destroyed ncr in  when battle of hoover dam took place in new vegas i realized that bethesda doesnt like spotlight which obsidian got and has with classic fallout and new vegas also vault tec being responsible for war and nuking is just lazy writing and not showing respect towards franchisethis show is made for people who never played nothing beyond fallout  and  and for general audience which wants cool post apocalyptic showfallout was always about postpostapocalypse and not about postapoclypsebethesda sell your ip to someone who has more heart in doing it
how can you introduce so many things into the world while still not really explaining a single one of them this first episode which should have set the tone for the rest of the series just threw many concepts of the fallout universe at the viewers face without even taking two seconds to elaboratewhat are these bunkers who build them how did the people get there what are the brothers of steel and why should we care why are there these metal giants what is the enclave who are those raiders what happened to bunker  i get it that these questions may be answered later but i dont feel like continuing when not even a single thing has been properly established in over one hour
against my natural antipathy towards post apocalyptic stuff i was intrigued by a  star rating this series was given by lucy mangan in the guardianthe plot was paper thin it was so obvious what was going to happen and the level of insult to anyone with a brain was appallingfor example the lucy maclean stabbing survival was unbelievable a stab in the gut is always serious and one should not remove the knife if it is still in the wound this was followed by the even worse idea that her husband came back to attack herequally stupid was the fact that her wrist mounted radiation as well as everyone elses did not go off the moment they met the people from vault  it was clear radiation level awareness was high but to fail to have automated alarms was frankly alarmingly moronici skipped forward a few scenes to the army camp and the arrival of the men in suits and immediately thought where was the airship built and where were the suits made i had already been wondering about the construction of the vaults themselves but the industrial level the airship  suits implied was far too farfetchedi could go on but i hope the foregoing gives you enough of the flavour of silliness which clearly is only going to get worsemy advice is avoid like the plague
like every other modern movieshow you cant care about the main characters and therefore cant care what happens in the rest of the showall lines are written robotically some actors appear to bring a little humanity to them but ultimately this is  of the show contrived robotic linesactors stare or speak perfectly smooth always waiting for their turnall kicks or drama is based around betrayal as if this is high drama for robots no human drama is seen anywhere such as itchy clothes things getting in the way team work personal style hair talking walking motivationson top of the robotic script actors and drama the show is also pushing gore desensitisation and acting tough and this is supposed to be sold to teenagers interested in video games
i have never played the games but i heard a lot of raving about how great this series was so figured it was worth a shotthere were some okay scenes but throughout the opening episode we are bashed over the head with far too much awful music that distracts from what could have been more entertainingit never really gripped my attention despite a few nice ideas but the main issue i had was the lack of clarity behind what was going on of course there was nuclear fallout but why were some living in bunkers and others in the outside world why was one from the bunker so confident to venture outside when it had already been stated that it wouldnt be safe for at least another generation i reached the point where i just didnt care enough about any of the characters to carry on watching any further episodesmaybe fans of the games can see more than i did but i cant be bothered carrying on with this series
i recently caught the fallout tv series and its definitely an interesting watch there were moments that felt a tad cringey especially with some of the acting but i have to admit the gore was on point its a bit of a mixed bag  some scenes really nail it while others fall a bit short still id say its worth giving it a shot personally i found myself enjoying it despite the occasional awkward performance you can tell they really invested heavily in production  the sets props and effects are topnotch surprisingly it exceeded my expectations that said theres room for improvement particularly in the acting department it feels like they may have prioritized visuals over casting but hey it worked out pretty well in the end overall a solid effort but theres definitely potential for even greater things with some tweaks here and there
i was looking forward to this show since it came out and all was well i was enjoying it but when i watched episode  todd howard has used his connections to basically do the adult version of destroying a lego set because he didnt get to be the one to build it if youre a fan of   or new vegas do not watch this show because they will piss on you and not even have the grace to call it rain they destroyed the ncr in fact making it so the ncr was destroyed pre new vegas therefore nullifying it this is such an adult temper tantrum this was made out of anger and spite that obsidian made a better game and it showsgood actors though sorry that good acting cant save bad writing
very poor acting and direction may be poor casting choice  whenever ms maclean and maximus are shown  they simply destroyed their characters it certainly killed the vibe of the game ms maclean character seemed portrayed as a teen whereas she is an adult who has zero to none understanding about outside worldzero self defence and she lived due to mercy of others though she is attacked she behaves like a teen  no seriousness at all whereas maximus  his character is simply powerless play the game folks only entertainment is ghoul  superb acting and casting choice also this confuses  who are the actual target audience
i have never played the game and so come to it with no expectations but reviewing this as a standalone show i am quite unimpressed the story is a pretty run of the mill post nuclear apocalypse yarn about feral humans trapped on the surface and privileged people dwelling in underground bunkers until things go wrong and they are forced to interactthe storyline is silly some of the scenes comedic for no discernible reason the pacing is dreadfully slow and the characters unengaging two episodes in i simply find myself uninterested in continuing to be bored by thisperhaps were i an aficionado of the game i would enjoy it more and be looking forward to future storylines but im not so i cant and the production does not have enough going for it to make me continue with it
old fallout fans finally get a return to the west coast and i wish we hadnt asked for itif you are a fan of the original fallout games youll remember the town of shady sands that got nuked which perfectly sums up how bethesda feels about anything that came before the writers call themselves fans but there are multiple examples of them ignoring established lore ghoulifcation does not work the way it is represented in the show they changed how power armors propulsion works which having them jet up from the arms exclusively makes literally  sense even ignoring the fact that in itself ignores previously established lorethe story revolves around a vault dweller going after a family member that left the vault i find it ironic that the main story beat is one of the things they decided to actually keep consistent with the games seeing as everyone is exhausted with thatalso the macguffin for this one is a magical device that will bring power and clean water to the wasteland sound familiarthey set up going to new vegas in season  which is just horrible going there canonizes one of the endings depending on which factions are present but we all know todd hates new vegas so i cant say im surprisedi will say its deserving of the  star because at least the costume design was great however i can honestly say youd have gotten a better representation of fallout by playing  at launch
ive forced myself to watch two of the episodes before writing a review seriously   gone with the wind is  and like its famous i dont give a da line episode  will create the long lasting he was screwing my chickens which im sure will go down in movie history why no mention of demolition man in the other reviews the female character is s bullock ditzy naive but has the chutzpah underneath and the exosuits have been used  times b no nose guy just made me think white michael jackson all these gamers have put this in a rating it doesnt belong good special effects
i tried really i tried i watched the first two episodes i fell asleep in the middle of each one that does not bode well for the compelling nature of the showi can see that theyve spent a huge amount of money on very complicated sets its certainly a lavish productionbut i never played the game i mean i could see where certain elements were obviously storyboarded right off of a video game and the npc nature of a number of characters is clear enough but am i supposed to care about an npc i dont know if i really care about these characters this girl this naive girl who has incestuous relations with her cousin is this who im supposed to root for and then this cowboy ghostzombie whatever am i supposed to care about him i dont identify with any of these characters i dont care about any of these characterslook it starts theyve been in a bomb shelter a long time okay radiation bad okay and they decide theyre going to trade marriages with the adjacent enclave okay everybody seems to have geiger counters on their wrists yet when the door opens up to the adjacent enclave no one checks i mean in a world filled with radiation you would think that would be the number one thing you do when you open the door this doesnt seem very smart this doesnt make anyone in this enclave seem intelligent it makes them seem like idiots and they die like idiotsdo they think im going to identify with idiots and root for them if so they are sorely mistakenand then this naive girl decides shes going to go out all alone in the big bad and i dont know find lassie or her father or whateveri really dont carewhen i watched spiderman tobey maguires character was similarly naive but he was also smart he made some intelligent moves he made some blunders and he learned from them but the character seemed to growin this show i have a real sense of heres character a here is character b character b will say something to character a character b will now leave character a will now go to character c and say something and on and on it goes girl loses her eye is this necessary to the plot would the story be any different if she never lost the eye guy loses his foot is this necessary to the plot with the story be any different if he never lost his foot so why am i seeing thiscontinuing the spiderman comparison when peter parker made a bad selfish call he paid with the life of his uncle ben this made a difference to the character to the story from there on in you see him consciously making efforts to make better choicesi didnt get a sense of that with this showheres a guy hes going to steal a iron man suit from another guy he cant fly it very well the flying looks very much like a man on wires at one point the cgi slipped and i actually saw the wires a little bit that wasnt good with all the money they spent on sets here im surprised they went cheap on the flying effects robert downey did it very well in iron man if youre not going to meet that standard then dont show him flyingtheres a difference between playing a video game and watching a movie maybe you havent noticed but your friends arent terribly entertained by watching you play a video game making a movie which is essentially the same as watching someone play a video game is not a good pathanyhow two episodes was enough for me i wont be backits not a bad production if anything its quite lavish in terms of sets but if you want characters emotions things to identify with the normal elements of the successful show you wont find that here
ive been a longtime fallout fan played the crap out of fo and  back in highschool enjoyed fallout tactics got hyped up by fallout  when bethesda took over played hundreds of hours in fallout  and slowly lost my enthusiasm after  fiascokinda sad that such a huge franchise with such a rich lore ended up being downsized to incoherent flood of ingame references connected by yet another abysmal script i have a feeling that writers havent played anything other than fallout shelter before writing screenplaylots of things barely make any sense in the setting especially when it comes to vaults and their inhabitantsits passable as a rainysnowy day time killer but not something that i personally would consider a good film adaptation heck some indie shorts on youtube did a better job at capturing a spirit of fallout while this show only focused on visually appearing fallouty
episode one was mildly interesting episode  was a clichéridden bore it was as if the writers had a very short list of things that were going to take place during episode  and had to drag out the action sequences as much as possible to take up time lots of pointless gore and really dumb infight choices on the part of the protagonists im familiar with the game  never played it myself but have watched others play it maybe if you like the game youll like the series because youll see references to it throughout the episodes but if youre not a fan of the game and you actually read books with good stories youll probably hate this series so i recommend you dont waste your time like most garbage being produced these days this series telegraphs everything thats going to happen because the writers seems to not have any original ideas of their own
fallout s eps min amzn prime is a video game adaptation apparently never played it so my review isnt dependent on that i wanted to like this i came to it with eager eyes and yet once again amazon studios continues their onslaught of cultural reengineering instead of producing quality independent entertainment this is another mightywoman first series that will appeal to  of a crybaby population and turnoff the  that should be enjoying it the first episode was just so ridiculously stupid in too many ways to count including the stupid s musical soundtrack that was so displaced i thought i was imagining it so i thought alright thats a throwaway episode maybe the second will be better no now add to all that crud racial retribution and even more incongruent s musicalia i am sooooo tired of progressive studios absolutely ruining entertainment i dont even want a new tv anymore im watching less and less because of all this  theyre throwing at us
while the show has good moments and charactersthat shows a surface level understanding for the lore of the show it is inexcusable to simply retcon the works of games you never worked on bethesda has deemed the arguably best three games in the entire fallout series   and new vegas null and void for a show that nobody will remember in years time whenut inevitably does not get renewed for a second season who signed off on this garbage fire that accomplishes nothing more than spitting in the eyes of the loyal fans who have maintained the games bethesda has abandoned through countless mods and fixes they never bothered to get around to
after watching another lackluster adaptation in the last of us i was hoping this one would be better however it was not the acting especially maximus his squire and to a lesser extent lucy drag the show down the guy who plays maximus is especially terrible the writing is especially awful very little of the dialogue is unique or interesting none of it is funny or thoughtprovoking to me you would think that a highly anticipated tv show with amazon and a nolan behind it could have been done better i guess this is just the world we live in a race by streaming companies to provide as much content as possible without placing emphasis on some of the basic elements to a good tv show writing and acting other than the set design which was pretty great this show is bad
they destroyed the lore and decanonised fallout new vegas its good tv show if you forget its a fallout because as fallout it makes no sesne how could shady sands fall in  just how the ncr was fighting with legion right after they lost the capital and even so why is it never mentioned in the games and dont get me started on the legion from what people were talking it sounds like legion never existed i dont know if the creator played the dust mod or what but now it makes sens that he doesnt care about fans opinion he knew what the reaction of fans would be the only explanation would be that todd wanted the show to look like it so he could finally kick new vegas out of canon the show also have bad color palet for the fallout universe its a good show if you ignore the fallout part of it
q what is more boring watching someone play a video game or watching a series based on a video game a doesnt matter either is boring whether youve played the game or not doubly so if you are an actual adult in this case the game is fallout ive played the fallout  video game and i thought it was one of the best single player video games id ever played so despite it being  years later i was intrigued by the concept of a tv series based upon it but the intrigue very quickly faded lets face it the plot and writing of most games works because they are games and the interaction makes up for the weaknesses in story plot characters etc a video series doesnt have the interactivity to rely upon to liven up the show and make it interesting so its usually a failure such is the case with fallout the serieswhat you have here is a video game walkthrough of a  year old game and just like the video game it is based upon it contains adult themes and graphic violence but is written for an audience who are actually too young to watch mature rated contentim envisioning a couple of guys from bethesda kicking back with a stogie and a smile thinking about how theyve cashed in on the same thing so many times now theyve lost count of how many billions theyve made off it people sure do love copies of copies dont they yup sure do
as expected this is nothing but the typical easily palatable generic theme park ride version of fallout akin to a bethesda game so in that sense it is the perfect video game adaptationits boring predictable and everything looks cheap developers just need to copy the general iconography of the series and remix its narrative elements into a formulaic narrative for the massesart is divisive this is not art but trash it deserves a  but for the sake of scale tipping it gets a one something like this is only possible in a world where visual iliteracy is at an alltime high and i dream of what would be possible if fallout and other projects film or otherwise were made with artistic freedom and intention
let me first say i dont play video games and i never even heard of this one the trailer look interesting and when our  year old want to watch with us well you take the offer secondly i like last of us thought it was interesting and after years of sloughing through the walking dead final seasons was a better take on the zombie genrenow to fallout the last of us i felt i didnt need anything from the video game to understand the story however fallout not so much if you play the game youll probably get it more than i did fallout is more fantastical than i like the script seems weak the characters are little odd acting campy not sure the story drags in huge parts the score is offyes its a pretty shot show nice camera work nice color saturation however for this  year old it just wasnt my thing
never played the game and think that is a problem for the series i dont have a bond with the series to be able to stick with it ive made it through  episodes and whilst not being bad its not hooked me in to finish it offif i dont go back to finish it i wouldnt be too bothered about it eithershow started off well and had great hopes for it it fizzled out into yet another dystopian show with the same factions fighting for survival gave me snowpiercer vibesit also feels like disney got involved in the making of it some gory scenes followed up by a lot of pg moments maybe makes sense if youve played the game but for me it hasnt convinced me enough to finish it off
please dear god do not make any more shows for the fallout series i was really excited about this show coming out but in all reality the first episode was just ok a the nd one made me not want to watch anymore if this show was created to make me not want to see or play fallout anymore then youve succeeded the fallout games are a  and the show was just a huge disappointment it feels like the everyone involved have never picked up a controller to play the game if the show had a complete rework it could possibly be good but as it stands i dont know why people are rating this show so high
good show very bad fallout show the show doesnt adhere to fallout lore and they dont understand how the world works the characters have a very obvious amount of makeup why would people with a finite amount of resources use them for makeup to make themselves look pretty the power armor very obviously had no weight to them which made the added sounds even more jarring they put fat people in the vault where they have regimented food the raiders blow up a bomb with remote tech the outfits are aways clean its the same with the locations they go to everyone and everywhere is too clean they seem have forgotten this is post apocalypse the world and people in the show doesnt look or act like atomic fallout has happened they really mention rads and they dont encounter any radiation in the irradiated wasteland
i dont doubt that this is considered awesome out of some sort of fanaticism or personal obligation for fans of the games but taken in isolation from a story character development acting and screenplay perspective etc this is actually not very good or at least certainly not worth its extraordinarily high  imdb rating at the time of this writing which i think might suggest that most of the reviews come from game fans at the moment i played one of the games fallout  for ps a long time ago but did not find it very entertaining in my opinion there is no good explanation for the current rating
one is a bad person who relies on betrayal theft and gambling in life and the other is a lucky girl whose brain is controlled by hormones the excessively disgusting male and female protagonists make people indifferent to their future development and thus the entire drama is not worth caring about to put it bluntly that dog is more charming than the male and female protagonists not to mention the disgusting plot and setting abandoning the plot of fallout new vegas and declaring fallout  as the victory of the brotherhood a militaristic organization but it has to be said that bs fans are really loyal halo is fiercely criticized radiation is praised humorous
sadly just terrible big fan of the game series so my dissapointment is immeasurable since a rendition this bad means it wont be renewed amazon is just a plague for ips and now another one is effected by the blight of bad acting looking at your smug clueless face aaron moten terrible extras filly was a disgrace on par with the monstrous modern star wars series and ridiculous choices made by amazon people giving this a good review are on serious copium shilling for amazon or they have lost their mind i am immeasurably dissapointed and am now going to shoot my dog as a sacrifice to the gods in hope that they will curse amazon out of existence
the show starts with potential then falls off a cliff rapidly which is subsequently sent down a long long hill actors do a good job with their material however most come off very unlikable the action is serviceable however it has apparent obvious nitpicks that you could dissect logic of both action and downtime feels very floaty and seems wildly inconsistent scene to scene dialogue is passable however seems intent on out of place comedy instead of a comedy it would have serviced better as a thoughtful tale instead of trying to appeal to an out of touch funny wonderland its connection to the games seems to be an unfortunate attachment that forces it to an awkward compromise though it should have been disconnected for both fans and nonfans alike so it could spread wings better even for nonfans theres glaring issues with its continuity and logic complete with unremarkable inconsistent problems with the overall story
is was spoiled by his presence all the fallout and all the nucleus theme of the show more men suffer from complexes is difficult to imagine how could this happen that it became known as an actor party crowd more of talent should not apply many people think that craig obscene in their choice so i say  hundred craig saints next to them in this regard just annoying to be extremely slow clumsy turns of the body and sits in a chair like a pregnant bear its awful indecent and ugly to see on the screens i totally was not to be interested in watching of a tv series with this mistakes and while the breaks to see the advertising staff the series fallout i started to watching from the season  in the hope there to see actors and instead of these great actors had to seen the entire screen obscured by unsympathetic tv shows on the nucleus theme and so not very much so and spoil their presence by such as the dogmeat do not respect the viewers time kind regards only salutations
first lucy mcclean do very close to lucy macclane this character is the worst parody of brenden fraser character in blast to the past shes mentally lost but supposed to be the best fighter from vault second the ghoul gun fighter reminds of the spaghetti western my name is nobody and acts worst than thst characterthe subplot if theres one has nothing to with falloutthe area has something to do with fallout and thats allthe ss and s from reviewers and critics are heinous and no one actually played all the gamesfake creation of fallout historythe dog is the only good actorthe writing for the whole storyepisodes is childish and roboticthe musical score is the worst especially in episode  fight scene
video game adaptations are everywhere nowadays most of them are horrible this one is one of the worst out thereyou take a game series make a tv show version of it declare it to be a canon continuation of the games and let a bunch of marvel loving redditors with liberal arts degree write for it what is the resultthe result is a show that shows zero respect for the original games contradicting them left and right laughably bad writing where even the tiniest amount of thinking makes the whole show fall apart and of course a show stuffed full with current day propaganda much like the vast majority of everything that comes out nowadays with incompetent ehite males goofy weak black males mary sue protagonist pregnant woman mowing down raiders while laughing manically wow so badass guys remember that scene whenever someone tells you this series is mature tiny ftm creature whos stronger than actual men and looks more uncanny than any of the ghouls i could go on this was all just in the first episode by the waythe writing itself is beyond awful the conflicts are reliant on every character being an idiot not to mention a lot of scenes are just stupid they outrun a nuke by riding on a horse come onthe choreography and cinematography are amateurish awkward camera angels and any scene that has someone punching someone else doesnt even look like the guys being hit by the punch and the cgi is really badthe humor is straight out of reddit and marvel that wouldnt feel out of place in a modern disney moviei swear theres so much wrong with this that i could list them here all day long but long story short dont watch this just dont everyone who recommended this to you on youtube or whatever has previously hated very similar shows to it but this one gets praised because we dont have any standards anymore and anyone will sing praises of any awful piece of media if theyre paid well enough
there are several not so subtle little nuances that will make you think just thatamazon has just bought disney and then have them make them a tvseries made from the ideas of a computer gamesince other games were already taken  or discarded a being impossible to make a cinematic adaption of  the victim of this hypothetical monstrosity was the epic warstrategygame falloutok now how do we come to the conclusion that disney is involved well quite simple in less than  minutes we had a socalled scene  that immediately turned into a musical act and a one that even bollywood would be ashamed of and lost all kind of sensualityto this ad a very tired and uninspired kyle mclachlan with a range of expresions only slightly above that of a piece of granit rockit took me less than min of this show to realize  you will never get those minutes back so why waste them on this peak of ridiculousnessno save yourself the pain and let your brain not have to suffer an aneurysm from trying to drown itself to end the torment
as a fallout player who has played fallout    new vegas and fallout  i was excited about this serieshowever the first episode was one of the worst things ive had the displeasure of ever watchingtheres a joke every two minutes and the tone is way too light it doesnt take the fallout world seriously i felt like i was watching a comedy show halfway through the episodethe actors and actresses are very annoying and the series overall just feels very unpolishedthis should be enough for you not to waste your time on this series i know i surely wont be watching any more episodes absolute garbage
"violence over substance the creators seem to believe that more bloodshed equates to better dramaheads explode bodies fly and video game logic reigns triumphantbut violence alone cannot sustain a series the relentless gore becomes numbing overshadowing any semblance of character development or plot progressionacting fallout the cast struggles to rise above the mediocrity of the script ella purnell as lucy delivers a strong performance but her characters journey feels lost in the chaoswalton goggins playing the ghoul is the standout but even his smoothtalking chaos cant salvage the sinking ship
the rest of the ensemble flounders their potential squanderedinconsistent tone fallout wavers between dark humor and grim violence while some appreciate the juxtaposition of punchlines amidst the apocalypse others find it jarring the shows tone resembles a bipolar wasteland leaving viewers disoriented and disconnectedplot potholes the narrative stumbles like a ghoul with a broken leg instead of weaving a compelling story within the established fallout universe the show opts for a new taleunfortunately it lacks depth and coherence the puzzlebox mystery occasionally intrigues but often overcomplicates mattersmissed opportunities with nearly three decades of game lore fallout had a treasure trove to exploreyet it squanders this potential the satire wackiness and rich worldbuilding from the games are diluted leaving fans yearning for more"
wheres ron pearlman i love fallout world since the first game but this poor adaptation is more like fallout  squeezing the lemon  than plant the seed of something greatdoes not capture the ambience of desolation of wasteland  even the clothes seems brand new not trash that we used to the locations dont feel real looks like a plateau set of a studio not even mentioned the forced ethnic protagonistthe power armour feels synthetic not real the cgi is not well designedthe actors done good  but the ambience lacks of post apocalyptic adaptation very bright lightning too much bethesda and so little little black isle style for mewar war never changes money either
as the title said this is the worse adaption ever it doesnt even stay true to the source material at no point in this series did the main character clip into the ground and fall out of the map there was also a severe lack of macho man randy savage and thomas the tank engine deathclaws in this series how can you be authentic to fallout without delivering the classic bethesda jank that makes fallout great in the first place bethesdas philosophy is nowhere to be seen in this entire series when one thinks bethesda one thinks of a half baked unfinished product and that is fine you know why because the fans will fix it anyway it just works
im on ep  and nothing has happened the fallout games arent boring so why is the tv series its so small in comparison but theyvr completely watered everything down to suit a wider audience than sticking with the lore like lotr theyve mismanaged something that could have been brilliant for them ive seen so far  gulper and  radroaches which makes complete sense since literally everyone complained about fo and i dont remember gulpers before then it seems like a nursery ride compared to the games the people dont see any real threats theres  small group of raiders too much back story and not enough stuff going on in real time complete waste of time and money i do like the cast whish is about as good as my reviews gets also seeing the sets brought to live is nice but thats it
i was excited to see the shows but i wasnt expect to see nude man too much blood and gore too much cuss words story lines and characters a little different than my vision of fallout styles i wish the shows more of pg because i have wife and kid around my wife didnt like hearing too much cuss words my daughter who is age  and theres full nude of man having sexual with lucy i know a lot of people like that to keep good score and liking the shows for rating but i wish the shows more of pg the ghoul is mean to lucy on episode wwhhhyyyy  lucy could have told ghoul the truth that the gulper took the head
this is not fallout world this is the care bears world characters without charisma a colorful world not apocalyptic the story is boring steel brother armors are made of polystyrene lol nothing is realistic everything is bland tasteless this a serie created with the name fallout and fallout character but not in the philosophy of a real fallout world not think for the old fans who made fallout known in the worldonly references to fallout  as if bethesda wants to send a message fallout   new vegas do not exist the pip boy it is also in polystyrene this a fake world not apocalyptic world
serious im not familiar with the fallout games so i started watching this series out of curiosity the high ratings showed that it could be something good but what was my surprise when i found out that its the most despicable rubbish its simply disgusting stupid poorly written ridiculous its absurd that so many people are enjoying this absolutely outrageous thing the characters are grotesque the violence is absurd and disgusting the story is offbase its worrying people definitely have reduced intelligence its not possible its hard to believe id like to know what the writers had in their heads when writing this pathetic thing this is probably the worst series ive ever seen below mediocrity
after watching the show in its entirety and the first and second episode one more time for good measure i am certain that the show is not about fallout or its inhabitantsfrom the beginning the show ignores one of the core principle of the universe radioactivity radioactivity is the number one thing that the vaults are built to protect its inhabitant against although vault tech also did some pretty nasty experiments but this is besides the point to the point where each and every adult vault dweller is provided with a device that constantly monitor the environment in this show its merely a macguffinthe ending of the show is also a macguffin without resolution vault  remains under vts control the bos gets control of the macguffin the next macguffin is in nv where the ghoul and dog meat are headed and lucy tags along because she has nothing better to dothe fallout universe is merely a backdrop thats why its paradoxically largely ignored
first of all i played the games and i love the games okay  is not the best onebut anyway i tried to give it a chancebut nopeit is not my kind of series it is not that bad like power of the but it is not my wishful idea of fall out not really funny not really violent not really cool but not even also really bad not really trash not really dark not really mineit could be also a netflix series or the haloserial that is even not so really bad but even not really goodso guess i am too old i stay with the games and forget about this try to make a serial of itbut watch it yourself it is the best way to find out i lost completly all of my hopes to get some good filmversions from the games of my youth
"thank you for your request to make the review of a tv show more readable here is a revised version that may meet your needs
man i really wanted to enjoy this show but man is it hard one aspect of television shows that i value immensely is when characters are believable and their actions have consequences that impact the plot in fallout however the characters seem to be playing roles rather than genuine peoplethe turret scene had me actually in tears it captured the essence of what plagues the show as a whole instead of writing a more believable escape lets have a minigun miss  rounds from only  meters away because it looks really cool"
the show started off really well very violent good simple story line the effects where really good all the sets look well thought of but then after episode  everything changes if your love the game and you expect to see your favourite creatures you love facing in the game in here well sadly youll be disappointed despite the game being apocalyptic the world never feels empty theres always danger around every corner here in the show our protagonists are able to walk around the wasteland freely without barely any danger thats right folks no super mutants no mirelocks no mole miners no deathclaws barely any ghouls the shows just literally feels like it ran out of budget midway through how can you have a fallout show without these creatures theres no fan service here as i watching i was like ok we gonna see some super mutants soon umm nope never came what about the walking robots umm nope none of that here either well screw you johnathan nolan who claims to love the games well clearly not
i didnt have much hope for the show considering bethesdas track record of retcons having the show take place in california raised the stakes even further todd howard claiming the show was going to be canon was practically a death sentence for classic fallouts lore low and behold the show comes out and all my fears were realized so many retcons even of bethesdas own additions from  and  claiming that t power armour was used in the liberation of anchorage making ghouls dependent on a seemingly magical serum which keeps them from turning feral changing what time the bombs dropped on the west coast erasing the most important location fallout has ever and will ever have lore wise shady sands reviving the west coast brotherhood and turning them into a weird pseudoenclave military faction akin to what has been seen on the east coast not to mention the fact that the west coast brother would never fly an american flag something they are seen doing in the show the brotherhood of steel originating as a fraction of the us military which seceded from the united states after finding out what was going on in mariposa placing the tv show in california was seemingly a way for bethesda to finally destroy the last remnants of black isles and obsidians work from the fallout franchise the show displays an obvious disregard for the lore of the universe and location in which it takes placefurthermore the show has some arguably cringy moments lucy using the term raider to refer to the outsiders infiltrating vault  raider being a term developed and used by people living in the wasteland how does she know to refer to them using this name when she is shown to be as clueless about the outside world as not being familiar and even spooked by a tumbleweed upon leaving the vault for the first time there are also a couple of what i assume to be self inserts by the lead team of bethesda two vaulttec employees are named howard and emil respectively who i can only assume to be self inserts of todd howard and emil pagliarulo overall the show feels weirdly disrespectful of established west coast lore more often than not ignoring it if not outright retconning established known facts
the writing is super bad and a a good amount of the actors are pretty bad and take you straight out of belief suspension i can blame some of that on the dialogue to be honest but some of the actors were reallllly bad the young soldier scenes were super cringe hahathe little plots and character motivations were all very cliche and cornysome of the details sets and costumes were really fun but i need some better writing to get into it i dont know how to find out whats worth watching these days lolseems like reviews are completely gamed by those with incentive back to word of mouth i guess
the show runs slow and no somehow no time go get engaged seems like if you dont know the game you cant follow up it is boring the logic doesnt a make sense a real waste of time and it somehow looks cheap like early  tv why do they make there shows  cant we produce something original with more depth we keep coming back to poor content for the low denomination also the design is soo poor nothing make sense after so may good shows that amazon produces like the boys they come out with this as an answer to the last of us if they aim to the gamers that will get them only the gamers so please dont watch this dont invest your time and give them more reasons to produce this crap
this looks and feels like a parody or comedy but it is really boring and lame the nonstop songs from the s makes it painful to listen toi fastforward through most of it since it is one of those shows that fills up time by showing you a character walking every step from one place to another so you can fastforward and help them get where they are going fasterlooking at the big eyes and goofy face of vaultgirl is another downer there used to be a tv series that featured a mongoloid kid he could make that look worka lot of the characters are just dysfunctional and pointless there is not much going for this show except the ghoul a combination of clint eastwood and rambowhenever the annoying s songs start playing i put it on mute the dialogue is lame this show is based on a video game so dialogue is not a priority you can guess most of it from just watching the music is all cheerful songs from the s i guess it is meant to be a cynical view of the postapocalypse the music is in the public domain and that is why it is being used for free this show is lame for many reasons
you wont want to miss the first  minutes and then you can turn it off and never give the show another thought i heard its got  story lines going on but i dont want to sit thru most of them to see one i have never seen a show start out so great with so much potential only to crash and burn as they try to blend in some uninteresting stuff that probably only a die hard gamer could like well my opinion is not near as high of this show as most so maybe i should watch a few more episodes but i dont think i can bear it lifes too short gamers probably dont know how short life is yet i quit after mario brothers
first of all im not a fan of the franchise but i like the first two games and new vegas i couldnt care less about they ruining this franchise further as nothing can ruin the aforementioned fallout video games for me anywaythe story basically doesnt exist its not much different than fallout s story the whole point of the tv series is just watching falloutthemed media and remembering the good old days of playing the video games not to actually enjoy a tv series to watch in that regard i would say its lowquality fan media but i cant because fallout nuka break and fallout red star is way better than this tv series for a fan content so it makes this tv series just a greedy tool to milk a franchise in the worst way possible contentthat being said if you are not familiar with the fallout franchise i dont think things would make sense as there is zero care for a new audience to fallout for example i dont think anyone who didnt played the video games can actually understand whats a vault nor what kind of setting this version of world is in this tv seriesdespite the aim of making you remember fallout there was a little from the video games its more like they took the fundamentals and they did their own things there is not even single super mutant but briefly mentioned around end of the season the only familiar enemy was mutant cockroaches bear and feral ghouls and thats it as for weapon only pistol assault rifle laser rifle was familiar there is vault stuff nuka cola and its caps some foods brother of steel ncr ranger outfit mention of enclave and thats all about there to see from video gamesbasically  episodes of content stretched to  episodes so yeah every episode is too slow and long some of the dialogues are so ridiculous i hope they used an ai because i dont wanna think a person was mentally okay and was good with this idk if there will be a nd season but sure as hell i aint watching it if i wasnt free i would stop at st episode instead watching the whole seasoninstead of unnecessary nudity it would be great if there was necessary fallout gore the gore there is is not enough for a fallout media i would wanna see v a t s targeting at least in one combat but i guess they didnt actually play any of the video gamesthere are two good things i can say about this tv series first is very famous actors and actresses plays in it and second is sometimes hearing music from the video games in the right time other than these there is no redeeming quality whatsoever
shallow what can you expect from a series based on a very poor childs video game nothing just a whole lot of inane disjointed ramblingno production value terrible acting incompent script if you desire the best of sifi try the apple tv app then watch isaac a solo is foundation the standard in wifi excellencereal scifi buffs avoid fallout at all costs i was shocked when i saw the imdb high ratings i just dont find them credible unless penned by eight year olds whose parents arent interested in raising literate cultured children the work is devoid of any educational or moral value serving as a childs time filler for patents who are neglectfulcan i saw more yes but ill refrain as you surely get the drift by now
i regret to say that the new tv show fallout was a major disappointment the first five minutes showed promise but it quickly went downhill from therethe most glaring issue is the severe lack of dialogue throughout the show forcing viewers to remain glued to the screen lest they miss a crucial plot point this makes for a frustrating and tedious viewing experiencethe scant dialogue that does exist is poorly written leading me to believe that the writers simply lack the skill to craft compelling conversations between charactersi found myself utterly bored after just  minutes and had to give up on the show entirely its a shame as the premise had potential but the execution falls flat on its facei cannot recommend this show to anyone looking for an engaging or entertaining experience save yourself the time and skip fallout altogether
heres my impression after the nd episode they spent so much money on bethesda rights and johnny cash music that they couldnt hire an adequate writer bu dum chhhhits a hodge podge of uncertain tone and poor character writing the script and storyline are sloppyive played fallout a bit and this world is a good aesthetic copy so far if thats all i wanted id just play the game ill give that point to them anywaysit had some promise in the first episode a bit meh but not all pilots are winners the characters were introduced and a story began bare minimum set up reallyhighlight kyle mclaughlin i love the guy but i didnt care one bit about his characterthe second episode is embarrassing to watch the music made me cringe and there was no logic in the fight scene did you hire neil breen as an editor a yodeler losing their voice on the soundtrack a literal child as the directorit feels like it wants to be the mandalorian sp but instead of being an appropriately paced adventure it punches you in the face with lame violence and awkward savagery and not the good kind of awkward because its neither funny nor charming i didnt laugh onceits a shame really with better writing this could be really fun it could be a fish out of water story with an overly optimistic main protagonist in a harsh world but it relies too much on aesthetic of the video game without making an interesting story to go along with itwhatever its doing its shaky id rather watch a show with solid characters and story developmentill update if i can even keep watching this but honestly id rather just play the video game i dont have time for sloppy memberberry shows
the late shamus young made a video essay stating that bethesda does not understand fallout you can find his name on youtube but the pertinent quote about bethesdaout goes like this black isle studios made games about survivors trying to rebuild from the ashes bethesda made a game about the ashes shamus said more but i will stick with my own words going forward bethesdaout is basically the creation of two people who are both quite vile in their own ways todd howards sickening envy and little man syndrome is its own essay but a quote from emil pagliurio or whatever his name is says it all he tells people at conferences not to bother working on a good story because the player will just tear it up and make paper airplanes out of iti have been playing computer rpgs crpgs since before fallout existed yeah yeah trust me the old man schtick is here for a reason and i can tell you one thing about them that emil is pretty incapable of understanding the story is the whole point of the exercise the eye of the beholder games of the early s even the story from the technologylevel drop of the ball that was the third game will be remembered long after pagliegos name is spoken for the last time because although the stories of the three games were rudimentary they were examples of because storytelling as opposed to the and then that pagli throws into the games but a more pertinent example that destroys paglits tantrum is baldurs gate iii the player character is fighting to stop themselves from being turned into illithid a stealing of the soul that illustrates what a disgusting and hateable race illithid are along the way we learn that the titular city of baldurs gate is under the control of an elder brain or something like that my memory problems make me unsure if that is the right name that controls the government and wishes to turn a vast swathe of people into illithid who do nothing but suck up to it forever and ever amen this elder brain might be a moustache twirler but in the context of illithid and their society being a brutal construct that revolves around slavery and abuse and they literally know nothing else including the concept of friends or family is what because storytelling meanspaglidiots stories are not constructed with reasoning he decides what he wants to happen and then does nothing to make it make sense within the world he is making in fallout  he tells us that the bad guys in the game wanted a pure source of dna to create humanlike constructs to replace people on the surface with but one the prologues shifting of the protagonist from suburbia to the vault would have resulted in every occupant of said vault being stricken with terminal genetic damage two one baby does not come close to equaling a healthy genetic pool three killing almost everyone else in the vault to get this one baby as opposed to calmly leading them away and taking them for study would yield better results you see what i am talking about yet when i say that emil pathetic cannot write a good story maybe emil you should make a story that makes the player want to read it you know like the makers of baldurs gate iii and i and ii pillars of eternity or the original mass effect didyou might have noticed i have rattled on about the story of the bethesdaout games a lot well get ready for it the story in this insipid series is worse something i did not think would be possible without bringing ed wood back to life and giving him the ip slowburn storytelling works a certain way as much as i want to keep anything to do with robert de niro out of my mouth the film heat is a classic example the big bang inciting incident takes a long time to get to we spend more than five minutes just getting through the opening credits and meeting the men who will perform the heist but there is a slow sense of tension creeping in from the start that lets you know something big is coming around the corner and even with the long quiet buildup there is always something happening something that gives you more information in every sceneone man at a university course about filmmaking told me and others that if a scene does not tell the audience something the audience does not already know about the situation the characters or the world then its proper place is on the cutting room floor if bethesdaout the waste of streaming time followed this rule it would be a thirtyminute singular episode and the little pieces of information that it gives maybe three times per hourlong on average episodes are communicated so poorly that one could be forgiven for believing that emil pathetic gave this project to his eight year old child we are told that one of our protagonists is getting married to a dweller from another vault but it takes us another two episodes for the series to properly explain that this vault is part of a threevault system where dwellers are exchangedin canon the vaults are experiments by a very nasty government that has ambitions to ditch earth and send spaceships across the universe to find another planet and make a better world yeah i know how it sounds each vault is an experiment to determine what situations could occur and how to remedy them one rather disturbing experiment that exemplifies the gulf between emil poorwriting and chris avellone involves vault dwellers being made to elect an overseer every year who is then ritually sacrificed to the vaults computer intelligence lest every dweller be killed year after year elections have become contests of favours dirtthrowing muckraking and power plays that eventually erupt in an open war the end result is five survivors who refuse to participate in any more killing but rather than the vault killing them the vault rewards them by telling them they are free to leave and come back at any time they choose to commit suicide and murder the one who has second thoughts about that because they feel they cannot live with these events the obvious intent of this experiment is to determine what will happen if an authority figure tells potential passengers kill one person of your choosing or we will kill all of youin this tepid series we have a trio of vaults that exchange and wed dwellers why what information is a scientist of low moral fibre meant to gain from this wait a minute does emil patheticstory even know how scientific experiments work does he believe that the company vaulttec just do this for giggles and has he given the slightest thought to how suspension of disbelief works then again given that the authors of this rubbish do not even understand the basic principle of chekovs gun i already know the answer to that question the words if you fire it in the third act show it in the first are a bit vague here in science fiction which bethesdaout is not it is more like if you fire it in the third act explain how it works and why it works that way in the first emil and whoever you have to explain how it works before you show it working and putting it up on the wall with a sign saying junk jet is not explaining dune parts one and two have killed your kind emil among other things they showed without a word just the actions and visual cues how the vibration shields that make conventional firearms useless workwe also get a huge flipoff if we are invested in the story of the real fallout in canon the brotherhood of steel is a dying starving husk because its refusal to adapt and its blind devotion to dogma has drained its life the new california republic is in trouble because a good leader has been replaced by an expansionist idiot who clearly never heard the saying soldiers win battles logistics win wars but can squash the brotherhood of steel under its boot like an ant i am not sure whether chris avellone and the team used giant ants in new vegas because badstoryesda forbade them from using any other assets chris avellone and tim cain would probably tell us today that giant ants and giant cockroaches are stupid ideas because the way insects take in oxygen means being over a certain size is impossible read fatal for themput simply streaming bethesdaout for people that shame humanity fails on every level it fails in storytelling i am now recalling that five episodes in i still cannot name one character that would pass the plinkett test it fails as a science fiction it is a five year olds idea of what science fiction is it fails on its own merits and the list of reasons for that is long many of its hey this is supposed to be impressive moments would make no sense without having played the game many elements make no sense probably the worst element is that buttheadesda wants us to believe that this story is taking place two hundred and nineteen years after the allconsuming nuclear war that the first real fallout with efforts to clean up and repopulate hiroshima and nagasaki which are populated today taking place in  the us army made pamphlets about hiroshima that resulted in tourists coming to see the ruins of the atomic city the authors of this trash series have no idea that the gap between nuclear destruction of a place and attempts to make the place habitable again is much much shorter it is probable that emil his minions and his napoleon syndrome overseer have confused nuclear missile detonations with nuclear power plant meltdowns then there is the everpervasive  looks exactly like  just with cool toys added a real science fiction author thinks about how technology is pushed by human nature emil and company think a society that can create robots that hover above the ground and can tend to some of the needs of a baby without injuring it would have televisions with screens that are no bigger than a human headif you say this series is good you are not end of story
fallout series is a cult game series its universe is build up upon  games has lots of places characters and stories however looks like dear producers and writers of amazon studios decided to only use the popularity among these aspects to make the show suitable for both longtime fans and newcomers in their own views suitable they mostly wrote it without a decent storytelling episodes    and  suffers from this very badly to be honest they could have told this story in  episodes adding  more episodes only thin out the storys effectiveness other than these problems its a faithful adaption and a worthy continue for the fallout universe only including episodes    
i hope the game is fun because the show is lame characters are fakey and not believable story is boring and drawn outi guess someone gets paid by the minute of show madealso some actors are mis cast bro and sis seem  years apart  why do all the people seem so clueless  had to really force myself to get through the first episode why hype something this much to write a story that makes no sense i give it one star for the cool robot suits another movie that literally uses cgi everywhere and makes it obvious maybe try writing a good story first amazon and then everything else would be okdont waste your time  go back and watch the expanse
i went in with low expectations but was pleased to see it was fun and engaging i was especially happy to see they didnt make lucy another mary suehowever now i have watched the whole season i feel its been let down by bar writing especially in the area of character motivations and without going into details that might cause spoilers i would say that the ending will absolutely fiddle with the timeline and canon of the games now  despite what the shows creators said about making an unrelated and original story in the official worldbut with all that said i think its worth a watch if you dont think about it too much  it has the dark humour of the games the retrofuturistic look mostly anyway and it certainly kept me watching all the way through
the power armour the actual design on it looks good they got the look of it and you can see the dirt and rust built up general weathering but when its in motion and you see the limbs move and the joints interact it feels and looks so cheap feet wobble the body doesnt sit snug arms look too elongated and weight like how heavy it should be is an issue it sounds heavy and the sound dept did a good job but it looks like it weighs nothing it looks like a cosplay costume made of foam and made to look coolthis worries me because someone actually a lot of people at some stage in its production said yes that looks authentic and cool itmadeitfarand thats my issue with this show everything is perfect but that godaaaaamn power armour suit it means amazon is ok with this theyre ok with that level of garbage god help warhammer
"the same holds true for tv shows as is does for gaming a post apocalyptic gun wielding wasteland is uninteresring even if you throw a billion dollars and hollywood at it quality is hard to find and ambition seems to no longer exist in tv shows as if gaming was a thing for losers maybe the actors and viewers are too young to have ever played the fallout games in order to appreciate how infintely better this would have been if these resources went in to creating a show around the elder scrolls oblivion for example that is probably the best game of all time the only thing good about fallout is that luck was a statmutated monster people  lame
vampires and mages  coolmake something better"
"sets ✅
customes ✅
acting ✅plot it was just the gamei assume i have never played itit felt exactly like you were playing the game the overall final goal of the movie was very underplayed and just felt like it was the final quest of the gamei know what you are thinking it is a game and the game has a storyline well if this follows the games storyline then it is not a very good gamei expected so much more from the show all while it followed the game plot there is as just no substance to the show reallythe sets customes and acting here great and it ended in what i would assume to be the ending of the game solve the final puzzle and bam game over show over definitely sets up for a second season"
ignore the game fans there will be a lot of  star reviews from the game fans saying this is all right and the script and scenes are right that the music and acgion are righr ignore them all thos is a boring show where the action has no continuity characters do kot develop actors cannot act bad idea was the one to make this adaptation and it has the same effect as the game they somehow can hype you up to watchplay it just for you to find out later this is boring and storyline is meaningless it could be awesome but unfortunately it is not the case if you need something to make noise in the background so you can fall asleep then its good
you just lost me as soon as the first episode marriage act was concluded which part of the story is intriguing can you at least introspect every bit of the plot is predictable with no interesting turns at all despite going into  episodes deepi am a big fan of west world because you never fall back on story telling despite trying to build up a character arc this misses badly hereyou just lost me as soon as the first episode marriage act was concluded which part of the story is intriguing can you at least introspect every bit of the plot is predictable with no interesting turns at all despite going into  episodes deepi am a big fan of west world because you never fall back on story telling despite trying to build up a character arc this misses badly here
its got to be one of the most atrocious tv series top  at least i couldnt get past the rd episode although im pretty much aware this is solely based on the games which ive never liked the games turn out to be good compared to this demented tv serieshow on earth this got  score its really unbelievable the only reason must be people from  years to  years old watching it on a massive scalethe script is horrible the clichés are horrible the actors are horrible theres absolutely nothing to like here if you are  years old or older id really like to know how they managed to produce such a giant piece of garbage fallout indeed
"having played most of the games i went in expecting more haloesque content virtue signalling to the usual people who wont be watching because too many white people or whatever bonkers things goes through their minds but slipping easter eggs from the actual game as breadcrumbs so we can all ignore our own amazon vaulttec feeding us our programmingand it does indeed deliver all of thatwhether its the brotherhood cadet with pronouns everyone seems to respect because tolerance is really one of the building blocks of steel p
whether its the shrewd business woman and her lesbian partner in filly whos basically the railroad for wayward enclave scientistswhether its the rebranding of communismits all there in its self righteous glorythat said though the story is about lucy who was raised in a vault with an apparent significant amount of inbreeding that doesnt seem to be touched upon too much beyond messing around with your cousins though it might explain her freakishly large eyesshe has all the subtle hints at s p e c i a l which suggests shes low s mid p lowish e high c low i low a and maxed l if you know you knowher vault  is allegedly linked to two other vaults  and  and to combat inbreeding they import breeders from other vaults to carry on the american gene so one day they can come out of the vaults and reclaim the surfacebut alas this is a ploy of the villainherovisionary lee moldaver played by mediocre actress somethingsomething who cares shes barely on camera but shes super scary everyone says so like the  times someone talk about her through the entire season
what we do learn is that lucys dad the overseer of vault  knows her intimately so naturally he warns everyone oh no wait i guess the writers forgot so he just neglected to tell anyone and gets a load of his dwellers killed and himself kidnapped so the plot can happennaturally lucy but also the most useless members of vault  survive somehow and suddenly has an effective security force somehow and doesnt want to rescue her father so with the help of her kissing cousin and confused looking brother she escapes the vault to go looking for himfrom then on it is somewhat chaotic where the show goesmaximus the storm trooper sorry brotherhood of steel cadet selling out his comrades the second he is free to instantly falling for lucy was uh necessary for the cringy power armor scenes and needed to be tied together somehow also some gratuitous male nudity scenes inbetween gotta have thosecooper howard aka the ghoul hunting for the mcguffin because he has backstory reasons really his story isnt great to be honest though the actor did what he could with the material easily the best character of the showit scrambles the lore from the games into whatever amazon wants changing the entire canon from china dropping the bombs because the us was developing supersoldiers to eeeeevil corporations dropping the bombs to kill the competition except it turns out all the vaults are factions competing so  uh factions bad except when good because thats thats what the writers wrotepitch meeting will have a field day with this"
mixed feelings on this show as far as the main actor the ghoul was fantastic he was perfect for the part he played it perfectly make up cool though his name is just plain he should have a cool name the lead female lucy was creepy to look at as her big eyes were made even creepier in this show adding to the grotesque nature of the subject maximus was just straight up awful in every single way watching him made my body hurt his acting and affect was just wrong its like he has special needs or is just not wrapped properly every time he spoke it was like he knew nothing about life the cgi in the show in the background was just bad really bad some other parts were done well but also pretty disgusting and inappropriately gross and could have been left out the show is all over the place and its just not for me i guess you have to be a gamer to appreciate it but it was terrible i do not recommend
please take into account that  of positive reviews havent played a fallout game before and it showsnot even the great cast could can save a storytelling that tries to dillute the interesting stories and setting that has kept me entertained for dozens of years i mean you have the whole fallout universe and lore to play about and you chose a lame vault depict the brotherhood as weak and stupid and a girl that seems so naive that talks and gives water to a guy with no pants on on top of that you forget three major charismatic fations ncr enclave and legion i mean wheres the character development the intrigue the oh snap momentsthe cgi are average and they dont disappoint but they are nothing to write home about either the action scenes are lame and boring coming from a player that has nuked the whole wasteland several times with my faithful fatman portable nuke launcheri mean is a decent show but let me give you an advice go play the games there you will find the stories the drama the no win situations the dry humour etc
tldr  a good enough opening sequence followed by no emotions but fear and disgust dull dated and depressingexterior day rich kids birthday partyadapted as you will know from a computer game from the s where you roved about killing people trying to collect weapons to kill more people that explains why the only emotional content in this lamentable series is paranoia and its the ohsocurrent not nuclear holocaust youve got to worry about where people live in underground bunkers built by god knows who and powered by god knows what and any pretence that it might not be a closed studio is abandoned graphic sadistic violence which involves women because you know feminism and characters with the depth of panini stickersfine for kids apart from the violence so it must be aimed at underdeveloped adults as long as they subscribe to amazon prime who cares
amazon primes fallout series emerges as a vivid tableau of the beloved video games universe repackaged with a distinctively modern twist that seems tailored specifically for a gen z audience helmed by lisa joy of westworld fame and geneva robertsondworet known for her ventures into actionpacked science fiction the series injects a youthful vibrancy into the bleakness of postapocalyptic survival however this injection skews the narrative favoring contemporary issues and stylistic flourishes that resonate more with new viewers rather than purists of the fallout franchisethe result is a series that feels fundamentally disjointed its slick and stylized with an aesthetic and thematic overhaul meant to appeal to younger viewers who appreciate rapidpaced storytelling and visually driven narratives this focus on style over substance and an evident preference for melodramatic over meaningful character development suggests a misalignment with the original spirit of fallout such a directional shift might capture the fleeting attention of gen z viewers yet it leaves longtime fans of the series alienated underscoring a generational divide in both the interpretation and appreciation of what makes fallout fundamentally compelling this version of fallout while visually arresting suggests that sometimes a shared name might be the only thing a adaptation retains from its source material turning a potentially rich narrative landscape into mere thematic ruins
very enjoyable show with great production value setting and premises just to put aside this info  i used to play the games back in early sas a rational analyst however i had some issues with some of the important events which were not build up but relied on luck to happen some characters decisions were irrational and served only to move the plot forwardalso a bit of an issue with the world building some characters moved from a forest areas to vast deserts without explaining how is that possible or how much time it costoverall  very fun and if some minor issues are fixed via hard work from fun it can become good
i started to watch this series because of all the positive reviews i like sf and i am able to watch bmovies but thisomg you really have to live in another parallel universe to even understand or like this after  minutes of watching the first episode i just could not handle it anymore if you are a addict to the game i can understand maybe but this setting is not even funny or exciting big skip this one it starts with redicilous tvs watches and props i can not place anywhere close to anything i ever watched maybe barbie the movie or something in that area for year olds can compare but i never watch that stuff as a adult
a onestar reviewin the realm of postapocalyptic fiction fallout has long held a revered status capturing the imaginations of gamers worldwide with its rich storytelling immersive worldbuilding and morally complex narratives so when news broke of a television adaptation anticipation ran high however the resulting series while bearing the name fallout is a far cry from the beloved franchise it purports to representfrom the outset fallout fails to grasp the essence of its source material opting instead for a shallow imitation that squanders its potential at every turn the shows premise follows a group of survivors navigating the wasteland of a nuclear apocalypse reminiscent of the game series setting however any semblance of depth or nuance is swiftly abandoned in favor of uninspired clichés and derivative storytellingone of the most glaring shortcomings of fallout is its treatment of characters rather than crafting compelling personalities with genuine arcs and motivations the series relies on tired stereotypes and cardboard cutouts the protagonist a rugged survivor with a heart of gold embodies every tired trope of the genre without adding anything new or interesting supporting characters fare no better serving as little more than plot devices to move the narrative forward without any real depth or developmentfurthermore fallout squanders its potential for thoughtprovoking commentary on the human condition in the face of adversity instead of exploring complex themes of morality survival and the consequences of our actions the series opts for cheap thrills and superficial conflict any attempts at social commentary feel halfhearted at best overshadowed by the shows relentless focus on spectacle over substancevisually fallout is a mixed bag with inconsistent production values and lackluster special effects while some scenes manage to evoke the desolate beauty of a world ravaged by nuclear war others feel cheap and poorly executed betraying the shows limited budget and lack of creative vision moreover the decision to rely heavily on cgi for its more ambitious sequences only serves to highlight the series technical shortcomings resulting in jarring moments of disconnect for the audiencenarratively fallout suffers from pacing issues and a lack of direction meandering aimlessly from one plot point to the next without ever building meaningful tension or momentum subplots are introduced and promptly abandoned characters disappear without explanation and the overall story arc feels disjointed and unsatisfying by the time the season finale rolls around its hard to shake the feeling that fallout has squandered its potential for a truly engaging narrative in favor of shallow spectacle and empty actionultimately fallout is a disappointment on every level failing to capture the essence of the beloved video game franchise it seeks to emulate from its onedimensional characters to its lackluster storytelling and subpar production values the series falls short of even the most modest expectations fans of the games will find little to love here while newcomers will likely be left scratching their heads at the hype surrounding this lackluster adaptationin conclusion fallout is a prime example of how not to adapt a beloved property for the small screen lacking in creativity depth and originality the series is a disservice to fans of the franchise and a missed opportunity for meaningful storytelling with its derivative plot cardboard characters and lackluster production values fallout is best avoided by all but the most diehard enthusiasts of postapocalyptic fiction in a crowded landscape of television offerings this onestar disappointment is best left to fade into obscurity
or pick up on the fact that they were talking about messing around sexually with their cousins it wasnt even thrown in as a joke the context was meant to be taken serious its already  mins in and theyve mentioned it twice now and im grossed out graham wagner and geneva robertsondworet wrote this offensive garbage and thought this would be okay to put into show based upon video game franchise and think that kids werent going to watch this heavily swinging towards they need to be locked inside of a prison cell or a padded room away from society disgraceful and i hope to god neither of you have ever put your hands on a child these two los angeles writers ought to be ashamed of themselves and to amazon who approved it as safe for viewers
from the beginning where they start out in what looks like a s type of birthday party but is supposed to be in the future anyhow the story should have ended when the four nuclear bombs exploded there was no way anyone would have survived it but somehow it continued on with poor storytelling poor acting and poor effects a very low budget movie from the looks of it then the people that came into the bunker were so obvious they were not friendly i will not go into detail but everything gave them away and it just continued to go downhill from the beginning of the show no need to watch the rest of the season the first show was painful enough as to how a elementary school could put together a movie this show needed a lot of help and did not get it
the gore scenes were tried to be childish but they are not funny at all in a certain scene our characters finger is cut off but the character does not react at all neither funny nor gore there is a contrived and meaningless humour in series fallout doesnt need to be funny or childish it is also quite pointless to completely delete the story in fallout new vegas how did you find cold fusion how do the characters live  years while it could have told very nice topics it turned into a meaningless story and its a shame also how come  characters constantly run into each other in this huge state are you too lazy to write logically
should have been a classic show but full of pointless holes in the storyline great cast and acting well thought out plots and characters but some things just made no sense and remain unansweredhow come lucy had her finger cut off with no pain and having an old one sown on quickly becoming a normal finger how come the squire becomes a ghoul healing injuries immediately yet the main ghoul cooper howard still doesnt have a nose and many say the bombs were dropped  years ago yet characters who were there on the day either look too young or say it was  years agoits type of show made for acid users where you just accept what you see without questioning what is actually happening or happened great if you like weird shows not so great if logic and intellect is your thing
full disclosure i have not played the game i find dystopianfuturebased storyline games boring ill admit that maybe im missing something but repeatedly killingmaiming zombiesvampiresmutantsgovt agents ad nauseum just doesnt raise my dopamine levelshaving said that i am  episodes into watching this showi like the story thus far and i am amazed at the sets the detail the size and the ingenuity that has gone into their creation i find that the character development is also keeping me interested so far and the dialog characters directing and editing are all good imo i really enjoy the cameos of actors i like that have frequently popped up so far as wellthe main  things that subtract from the the show to me are these   its pretty easy for me to figger out whats going to happen next so far  yawn  the lead characterheroine while very well cast scripted and acted has something about her personality that makes me want to ram my fist into the screen and smack the holy skeet out of her and  the soundtrack of the s country and western tunes pushes me to my limits of endurance granted that may be because my dad constantly listened to this music when i was a kid but i feel it is mostly because i only like this kind of music when i am really drunk and going thru a some kind of betrayal in my life its definitely not a music genre i want to hear when i dont feel that wayso to summarize i am slogging my way thru this show tbh i hope it keeps me entertained well enough to put up with its detractions
fallout expectations will falladapting movies and shows from video games seems to be a new trend in hollywood this can sometimes be confusing for the audience if the show does not do a decent job at explaining what is happening such as in the case of amazons new show fallout jonathan nolan etal and executive producer todd howard it stars ella purnell from miss peregrines home for peculiar childrenafter the apocalypse destroyed the earth  years ago a select number of people got to take shelter in vaults safe from the outside world however when lucys dad is taken she decides to go outside to find himthis show may sound like other shows such as the  but unfortunately fallout is confusing pointless at times and a little bazaarthe first couple of minutes of the show were unnecessary it explained how the apocalypse happened but the characters that participated in it had nothing to do with the rest of the story the timeline jumps to the vault survivors  years later the way the show jumps between two plotlines the vault dwellers and people on the ground is very confusing the show never makes it clear what the ground people are trying to accomplish nothing like how the  portrayed the sky people and the grounders maybe fallout should have introduced the ground people only when the storyline had lucy ella purnell needing to know of them the only way i was able to figure out who some of the characters names were was by looking them up the show does a bad job of introducing other people besides lucyfor a show labeled as a drama fallout has some very strange moments a dog who eats things that most dogs would not such as people a robot that does not seem to serve a purpose in the plot and very odd creatures that attack people on the ground for no reason if the robot were helpful and friendly like the one from lost in space that would have given fallout a likable creaturethe only two characters that make this show not completely terrible is lucy and cooper howard walton goggins or as i call him grave dude since he rose from the dead purnell did a good job at portraying lucys caring and innocent nature in a world where all they seem to do is violently fight this show may have been a little better if it only focused on the adventure lucy is having to go on to find her dad if you are looking for fallout to be another good apocalyptic sifi show like the  your expectations will fall
lazy writing lowsy script forced dialog not sure why ppl are saying  stars its medium at best un realistic drama the first episode  bounty hunters are after a bounty but first decide to dig up a complete stranger from his grave with the hopes maybe he might help because hes been to california before and its worth the risk and split the reward with a guy who was pretty much a goner let alone bounty hunters trusting a guy they dont even know so they help him out of hos graveprison and up getting killed for it anyways lol but ok so many other holes in the story i dont feel like getting into just lazy writing and the knight in armor telling his squire u go check out the pitch black cave by yourself while i stand here and be a complete d to you while you do it ugh its so bad im done
i gave this a  out of  because everything i saw was fantastic the first episode was incredible and true to source material while being its own story at the same time and then my experience with the nd episode was also very good even tho something seemed off it was at  minutes into the nd episode that i checked and realized it was playing episode  at this point the whole story was spoiled for me and watching the show was completely pointless i was incredibly disappointed with this being the case because everything i had viewed was fantastic but also ruined the whole series for me im sure if i was able to see the whole show my rating would be an  but i have the worst taste left in my mouth left for the show after my experience just to feel invested in this season or a possible season  i need to sit through hours of spoiled frustration
we have a military guy who knows or did not learned nothing during his time in the army he is a joke he doesnt think strategize knows about combat or anything why he wanna wear a power armor because flashbacks of someone saving himwe have a pretty inocente girl that after her vault is mostly slayed no one seems to really care they making an assembly and after that theres already  survivors there nothing makes senseand of course we have deadpool but he is also the man in black from westworld also he has superpowersand the cgi blood and gore  omg  fallout the boys
ive watched about  mins of  episodes its not fair on everyone who worked on this but its a terriblebilly wilder told us content they can make all the quicker cheaper ways to make stuff but if it crap its crap and a plot from a game doesnt give this great pedigree no matter how much money is thrown at itwide eyed and stupid daddy searcher lucy is the star good ol boy walt googins must have been paid very well too well but hey its hollywood what used to pass for hollywood anywayoh  one of my faves mr matt berry long way from darkplace maybe notwhat are all the grads with creative writing degrees doing not creating for surethis is a mess to say its all over the place is kindevery show about the future is bleak hell just a different flavour this timei cant find anything nice about this
the world of fallout is a serious place life is cheap and ends with alarming regularity the first episode was a joy to watch really enjoyed studying everything in the background incredibly faithful to the look and feel of the games little easter eggs everywhere could have done a lot better on power armor but cant have everything i suppose watched episode two and almost shut it off fallout is not a slapstick world ill watch episode  but if it continues down this disney kiddie world ill have to bail it will pain me to do so especially since my secret mancrush walton goggins brings it but i can take only so much cornball humor
"as for scenery visual effects  well they are simply amazing except power armor fly animation motion there was better in s
items locations and characters from fallout  are precise and looking greateverything else it gets from bad to worsehumor well sometimes depends on your age p
after rd episode story becomes very boring and its starting to focus on moral choices and on not making any sense relation with lucy and maximusscenes that dont have anything in them last for minutes or are streched beyond reasonallmost every character in this show is dumb as hellscenes of fighting are riddiculus i dont know if they are dancing or get lost sometimesmost of things that is happening doesnt make any sensesurvive ability of political correct characters is really annoyingi really enjoyed watching main character  ghul and tahts it
like the last of us  another teen movie  and with such potential ehhmy recomendation  play fallout  das for good adaptaion of a game i recomand halo"
yes thats right incest script lines at least three times within the first  minutes of this show i could not finish episode  and i am considering cancelling my amazon prime membership because of this i do not want to support degenerate television and movies with my time or moneyi have played all of the fallout games i was hoping that this series would show the darkness grit and eerie nature of the fallout world instead the actors are awful the lines are absolutely cringe worthy their attempt at jokes land completely flat in fact the only pauses you hear in dialogue is so that that those grinding lines have a chance to land but they never do i could not finish the first episode after the  or so incest lines within  minutes of starting episode one
"i remember the game boring me to death and now there is a show boring me to tears
youll be lucky if you see something happen every second episode its slowness is only matched by its convoluted plot points that is annoying asfthink  a space odyssey or startrek the movie if you want to get an idea of the pace of this showi really dont understand why all shows these day must have the same plot points as dallas must every show have all these intrigue politics and backstabbing that we use to only use to get on day time soapsi am forcing myself to watch this and unlike ateam stargate or band of brothers will never watch it ever again"
thats the only thing you need to know about this seriesbut since i need another  words here we gosuspension of disbelief is a powerful tool in storytelling allowing audiences to immerse themselves in fictional worlds and narratives however when a tv series relies too heavily on this suspension without regard for logic or consistency it can detract from the overall quality of the show while some degree of suspension of disbelief is necessary for any form of entertainment there are instances where it becomes excessive leading to a breakdown in immersion and engagementone of the most glaring issues with a tv series that abuses suspension of disbelief is the lack of internal consistency when the rules of the fictional world are constantly changing or ignored altogether it undermines the audiences ability to invest in the story for example if characters exhibit superhuman abilities or defy the laws of physics without any explanation or justification it can feel arbitrary and nonsensical this inconsistency erodes the credibility of the narrative and makes it difficult for viewers to emotionally connect with the characters and events unfolding on screenfurthermore excessive suspension of disbelief can lead to absurd plot developments and contrived scenarios that strain credulity when characters consistently make illogical decisions or find themselves in implausible situations it can feel like the writers are prioritizing spectacle over storytelling for instance if a character repeatedly survives lifethreatening situations through sheer luck or coincidence it diminishes the stakes and undermines the tension of the narrative instead of being invested in the outcome audiences may find themselves rolling their eyes at the sheer improbability of it allmoreover relying too heavily on suspension of disbelief can result in lazy writing and missed opportunities for meaningful storytelling rather than exploring complex themes or character development the focus may shift to increasingly outlandish gimmicks and plot twists designed solely to shock or titillate audiences this can lead to a shallow viewing experience devoid of substance or emotional resonance when viewers are constantly asked to overlook glaring inconsistencies or nonsensical plot points it diminishes their respect for the creative integrity of the show and can ultimately drive them awayanother consequence of excessive suspension of disbelief is the erosion of narrative tension and stakes when audiences no longer believe in the plausibility of the events unfolding on screen they are less likely to feel invested in the outcome whether its a lifeordeath situation or a highstakes confrontation the impact is dulled when viewers are acutely aware of the artificiality of the drama without a sense of genuine risk or consequence the emotional payoff of pivotal moments is significantly diminished leaving audiences feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilledin conclusion while suspension of disbelief is an essential component of storytelling it must be employed judiciously to maintain the integrity and credibility of a tv series when used excessively or without regard for internal consistency it can undermine the quality of the narrative diminish audience engagement and ultimately detract from the overall viewing experience by prioritizing logic coherence and meaningful storytelling tv series can create immersive and emotionally resonant worlds that captivate audiences and stand the test of time
on its own merits this is a decent show well developed world well developed characters truly excellent production values and good actors where it majorly falls down is in being a fallout showtransitioning anything from an interactive to a passive medium never really works but this only has the veneer of the fallout universe it ignores all the lore and everything that would make it more fallouty ghouls dont sound like ghouls established lore is ignored or contradicted and nothing is added to justify itif this was a totally new franchise it would be a solid  out of  the associations to fallout drag it down significantly as the tv and the games cant be judged independently when the tv claims to steer so close to the source material its total disregard for it needs to be factored inwatch it if youve never played the games and watch it if you have but just pretend its not fallout
like many shows that amazon has done in recent years all our fears about how bad this show might be has come true they made a show for people that have never played the game its not as bad as i was expecting which is why i gave it a higher rating however if you are a big fan of the franchise youre likely to be as disappointed as we all thought we would be oxhorn explained it right in his review of the trailer its better than the abomination they created in the wheel of time but not quite as entertaining as the halo series which fans hated if youve never played thw game then im sure youll enjoy this show since it was made for the non fans yet again for some weird reason
it was a lie from the very beginning if the father and daughter really considered a nuclear explosion from such a distance they would at least be blinded forever not to mention that all of their exposed bodyparts would have received third to fourthdegree burns a nuclear mushroom in appearance is an explosion of petroleum products in a real thermonuclear explosion a fireball is formed eclipsing the sun with its glow and it shines like that for several tens of seconds the day is clear and cloudless everything around this holiday would have already caught fire plus the shock wave is much stronger than shown
i understand people loved the game i gave it a couple of hours back in the day and moved on thinking now i possibly didnt give it enough of a chance or maybe im just lazy i gave this show a couple of hours and didnt mind what i saw gave it a couple more and started to enjoy it a couple hours later like ep  and  i was hooked and sad there were no more episodes to watch one of the better shows ive come across in the last few years good acting well written scripts and twists i didnt see coming  episodes before they happen cant wait for season  although im sure thats a long way off 😟 thinking maybe ill dust off my ps and give it another look
disgusting use of extreme graphic violence that does not necessarily serve the plot hard to watch i felt nauseous in the middle of the first episode and stopped watching itits like ruining a good restaurant dish with copious amounts of hot pepper and salt a reasonable person wouldnt be able to enjoy it unless their senses are so dulled by past exposure to a great deal of violent content in my opinion it would have been possible to convey the same plot even without injecting quantities of fake blood at the very beginning if you have a sensitive stomach save yourself from watching this series
another attempt by the cashguzzling giant to completely ruin a series i bet amazon thought that this would make subscribers forget at how they are getting gouged by the absurd new pricing model it is a truly awful show the dialogue is clunky and does not captivate the action is poorly executed the entire production is a joke honestly they should fire everyone involved in this abysmal piece of trash if you enjoy the game series then do not watch this garbage it is truly a waste of your life to gaze upon such a poorly executed production if this is what the writers strike fought for they need to give up because this is not worth a penny
i have never played the game so my review is based on the tv show onlythe world building and production quality is excellent the sets costumes direction and cinematography are all great the first few episodes grabbed my attention and held nearly all the way to the endthe problems came in the last couple of episodes what happened in vault  dont know who cleaned it up dont know who poisoned the raiders and why dont knowwhy didnt the self harm boot girl get punished dont know who gave her authority to decide who can be a knight dont knowi hope the attention to detail gets better in season two
this isnt the worst adaption ever far from it but neither is it amazing as a standalone piece of entertainmentits just bland and unimaginativeterrible fightscenes possibly the worst fight scenes ive seen to date apparently we have steve battaglia to thank for them who also made the worst john wick and expendable movie fight scenescharacters are okay side characters are kinda funny sometimesdialogue is fine leagues ahead of anything netflix generally makes i have no idea why theirs is uniquely badcomedic theme works well with the over the top violence and goreim not a huge fan of the bethesda fallout games but they managed to water down their already watered down take of the original ipnot that that is its worst quality  that is easily the lack of pressing character stakesonly worth your time if youre really bored
