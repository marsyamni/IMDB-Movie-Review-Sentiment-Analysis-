as a hardcore kaiju fan of many years i love that we are being treated to all of these godzilla movies as of late my opinion of the first two in this series godzilla and godzilla king of the monsters is that they were somewhat reality based and not obviously made for children my criticism of g v k the ending in particular and this movie is that so much of it is farfetched and fantasy based much more cartoonishthe bottom line is theyre making the monsters out to have too much human intelligence when they should actually be more animalistic this was like watching a superhero movie and in my opinion making the monsters out to be superheroes is a huge mistake thats what happened when toho did this in the ss which resulted in godzilla movies becoming silly lowbudget kids movies which has since been ridiculed for decades and has tarnished godzillas image i understand the writers are trying to be creative and give the fans something different from all of the other monster movies out there but this can be done without all the cheese please stop making the monsters so humani enjoyed the movie but have to admit that i am somewhat disappointed
"monster  hurrah
humans  garbageanother monsterverse installment to the collection gave me another reason to visit my cinema luckily i wasnt disappointed i got everything what i expected which might be summoned by the two equations aboveabout humans
if you want to watch the movie at home dont waste time on humans subplot its completely pointless the dialogues arent funny or smart they serve poor exposition which is painfully exhausting to watch you see the monsters fighting and these characters are explaining in between oh he is protecting  come on who wrote this in my opinion if legendary studios wants to include humans they should at least try making them just little interesting or just remove them completely none of them is doing anything necessary furthermore whatever theyre doing doesnt make any sense why the hell are they in the hollow earth without protection one guy is just in a hawaiian shirt the amount of dangerous monsters is not alarming i guess paper boy is filming everything but the british guy in a hawaiian shirt says something like its better to keep it in a secret this ancient civilization shouldnt be exposed to our world the girl from godzilla vs kong she is from that world and has weird xmen power  is among modern people so the world already knows the underground world what does he want to hide there is more of this stupidityabout the monsters
kong is the lead his journey is simple he feels lonely he wants to have a family of his kind from the trailers you know there is more giant apes so i am happy to see them because i am team kong  id want to appreciate the dialogues between kong and this little ginger fella they dont use words as we do but believe me these two are more interesting than the humans you will enjoy itgodzilla and the rest are just monsters sadly godzilla isnt intimidating in this movie his only goal is to gain the pink level of nuclear power and then use it to fight the bad monkey however the fight scenes are awesome  this is why we are watching this type of movies so if youre a fan of giant monsters i recommend godzilla x kong the new empire and dont expect to see raise of the new empire in this movie its a kinda awkward title generated by chatgpt"
lots of titans fighting thats why we go to something like this rightg x k is about the same for entertainment wise as g vs k though id give the newest entry a slight edge for a couple of reasons for one theres a bit less silliness theres comic relief of course but its not out of place or goofy the s throwbacks with the tunes synths and vibes were great and lastly the titans were back to being the bad guys instead of humans i always find it a bore when you watch a movie about monsters fighting but have to bare through a story of human villains and their idiotic ideologiesa side note its hilarious that these titans seem to really enjoy having their royal rumbles in the biggest cities on the planet or while destroying some of the worlds most revered structures like really guys you couldnt have thrown down in the middle of the sahara more destruction equals more entertainment i suppose also godzilla just casually murders hundreds if not thousands just walking around from point a to point b i digress go pink zilla
releasing merely weeks after the critically and commercially acclaimed godzilla minus one won the oscar for best visual effects is a boon as well as bane for godzilla x kong the new empire  while more people are familiar with the behemoth radioactive lizard there is an undeniable urge to draw comparisons between the two movies adam wingards second monsterverse film following s godzilla vs kong delivers satisfying titan action but overall the film feels like a step back largely owing to dull and tedious human dramapersonally i found godzilla vs kong to be the best monsterverse film it embraced the absurdity and silliness of its premise and made the most of it to deliver one hell of a show placing the titans front and centre while jettisoning any unnecessary human drama godzilla x kong the new empire starts off much slower with the actual plot taking nearly  minutes to kick in combined with an uptick in uninteresting human drama this slows down the movie with certain portions feeling boringmuch like its predecessor godzilla x kong the new empire struggles trying to the connect the stories of the two leading titans kong is the heart and soul of the movie with godzilla largely feeling like an accomplice or sidekick the first half of the movie is almost entirely about kongs exploration of hollow earth the subterranean ecosystem where the titans live while learning about the mystical world was engaging and intriguing it lead to a delayed introduction of the villain leading to the third act feeling slightly rushed and less rewarding compared to the enthralling finale of godzilla vs kongthe action sequences themselves are a whole lot of fun with a face off in hollow earth with gravity slightly messedup being one of my favourites of the entire franchise the finale in rio delivers plentiful excitement and fun toogodzilla x kong the new empire is best suited for fans of the showa era for kong fanslike myself there is a lot to like about the movie owing to the humanisation of the great ape the action scenes are fun colourful and campy similar to its predecessor but an increased focus on human characters and a slower pace make this a slightly underwhelming entry to the monsterverse
the movie features very few scenes with godzilla only a few fragmented shots including the final battle godzillas total screen time is probably less than  minutes the movie is filled with monkeys throughout making it more like an independent kong film because it barely depicts godzilla with kong having far more screen time than godzilla i feel like godzillas role was forcefully added and feels disconnected from the rest of the movie also the portrayal of shimo is superficial failing to showcase its power while skar king is portrayed as a clown it cant even defeat king kong oneonone lacking a strong antagonist that leads to a rushed conclusion of the final battle finally i have a big question why do the director and writers like monkeys so much
it serves up a berserk dreamscape with plenty of payoff to please the monsterverse faithful shame about the human stuff though director adam wingard has a lot of fun with textures colors and camera work and hes adept at giving fans the overthetop monster action that they demand via an imposing new villain unfortunately theres no time to spend on making things make sense or even matter all that much and what few emotional punches are thrown lack the necessary wind up to connect save for some very well done moments between kong and his hollow earth kinoverall didnt live up and the plot was mediocre at best
when me and my friends went to see the movie i really enjoyed it but friends went over the moon for it they gave it a solid  so for the audience that doesnt want anything serious  this is hella perfectthe story wasnt anything new that we havent seen before but it serves the movie good my biggest problem with it was the human characters just like godzilla vs kong the characters are flat and i would rather watch monsters fight than themthe direction by adam wingard is pretty good the action in particulat is really well done and you can really see whats going onthe actors were ok for the most part but for the script they are given they are finegiant praise to the vfx everything looked amazaing and you can see that the money went in the place not like captain marvel  for example which had a  million dollar budget and for the money it looked awfulthe music is good too i wouldnt buy a soundtrack but it served the storyoverall if you just want to have fun for  hours this movie is perfect
whats with all these  and  stars reviewers its now they paying people to give movies high praisei went to cinema and i feel so uncomfortable the whole almost  hours timethe comedic thing put on the movie make this looks so cringe and cornywhat they want to transform the monsterverse into a joke like marvel and the humans in this movie are all cringe whyyyyy why they allow to transform every movie into a bad cringecorny comedy i dont want to see cringecorny i want to se some seriously dark movie about big monsters stars just for some very decent special effects and thats all the  version godzilla was the best as well as the kong skull island now they transform kong and godzilla into some bad comediants dont listen to these  stars reviewers
this movie has a real problem  it tries to cater to a wider audience by adding more marvel type action and storytelling rather than focus on doing what it could do really well and appeal to a more niche audiencethe doing what it could do well part i am referring to is the bigness of the kaijus  monsters not just their actions but their presence and size a bit of slowness in how they walk and move to feel that thud when they take a step and the sheer overwhelming presence that they represent  like in pacific rim or in godzilla king of the monsters you feel the bigness and the sizea splash in the ocean can causes huge tidewaves due to the sizea resounding boom that is felt when two kaijus collidewhere is thatthere is no respect paid to the bignessits just they took some superhero action sequences and applied them to giants and made them move like they were the same size as humansthere is no feel or bigness  its simply a  out of  movie because it caters enough to enough people because it goes for whats popular and throws a lot of it while giving away the depth and the feel of a big monster movie that is what godzilla is meant to be
without spoiling the movie this was absolutely a waste of moneyyes kong and godzilla are in there and some other titans but epic battle noit gravitates towards avataresque mystical mumbojumbo tries to copy from many other movies like music scenes from guardians of the galaxy jugnle danger from jumanji indigenous people mythology from avatar epic battle like planet of the apesspecial effects did not wow me any second maybe thats a good thing because everything else we see nowadays is just completely ai generatedif your kids want to go see it by all means but otherwise its a big let down
i dont know what i expected going in to see this at the cinema but it wasnt this i guess i expected more focus on the humans again and less on the titans againbut this this was not that yeah they had humans but they were mostly more of a footnote in the story which could have been almost completely told without the humans but they did add a little flavour to the mix especially dan stevens but then i am kinda biased towards him as ive loved his work in everything ive seen him in so farall that aside kong was great  and massive  and godzilla was pretty damn impressive too  and just as massive as kong  but more than that we got a look at a few other titans as well and they were all pretty impressively brought to life here my only gripe about kong himself is that in the early going the filmmakers tried to humanise him just that little but too much and it kinda fell flat to me once things actually got moving and shaking though it all got a lot better
somegeekguywow im just as surprised as you are reading this right now believe me my expectations were kind of meh me personally godzilla vs kong gvk was okay nothing special maybe about a so who won this time in godzilla x kong  what is this new empire well legendary studios of courseafter a victorious achievement for toho we all know what weve come for here at legendary studios  the results are definitely not a minus onebecause this time we up the ante and the people have spoken we want this legendary in this film is simply unlocking the massive cheese vault oozing into my optic stems godzilla x kong the new empire is a hyper adrenaline rush energizer it felt like my brain waves digested a high voltage energy drink kicking every inch of my brain cellsdan stevens is a solid comic relief along with brian tyree henry the jokes land a bit better this time around the aura  creative decisions in this film have almost an s vintage vibrant feel the music  color palette compliment each other perfectly along with cinematographymy issues well why does the movie have monarch being okay with bringing anybody down to hollow earth reliance on slight jumpy exposition small things that could have been explored a little more to leave more an impact its not perfect for those however i will argue this film was a lot closer to striking close to being perfect than you would think a film of this caliber could dothis is what happens when cinematography awareness consistency  finding the footing on following kaijus gets the best of a cinematic experience its just as much a kaiju story as it is a human story  its a love letter to the showa era  fans should be proudive never been more invested in the actual story of the kaijus until this movie expositions  humans dont ruin it either this time its not anything special but what is special are what we are here for  thats the kaijusnew empire by far has the longest showtime for kaiju action that ive ever seen in a monster flick beautifully shot cinematic camera scenes there is one specific upside down shot unfolding to the right side up just amazing cameraworkthe gradual building blocks embedded in the story left exciting awe in entertainment  care of handling kaiju moments the humans are just enhancers for the monsters compared to gvk they have a better direction here without getting lostits a ride took the issues of gvk  corrected it more theres plenty of action if not more than youd think theres plenty of surprises emotional character moments with humansmonsters  although a not so perfect expositions still a solid fun plotstory following the elements at play godzilla x kong was a lot better than i thought it was going to be  thats worth something  
godzilla x kong is undeniably vacuous and as hollow as the imaginary world it portrays its essentially a very forgettable monster mashup that aims for the heights of the epic and terrifying but instead serves an ott nonstop chestbeating slugfest smothered in tawdry cgi its overpowered monster wwe seemingly presented as something the filmmakers believe or estimate an audience will like as if it were the product of a soulless spreadsheetthese tired titans of bygone cinema have been pulled back into the limelight as the viewer suffers a nowhereplot aimed at the lowest common denominator the kaiju terror is here but in a very watereddown stateno dialogue because its just senseless roaring beasts dont need to pay anyone to write a good script excessive closeups of the beasts all the time well that handily means they didnt need to animate higherbudget complex scenes from a more interesting pov sensory overload to distract the viewer from the complete lack of actual substance check the cornercutting is so apparent the more you look the buck is passed onto the consumers who continue to accept this poor standard of filmmaking time and time again
wow just wow now the thing is the reason i am saying wow is for a few big reasons that can probably relate to a lot of regular humans like me because i am most definitely human and not godzilla trying to promote his own film the reasons being cgi big monster go rahh and epic battle scenes anything else is boring and i frankly could care less about in this film because it affects nothing and all i care about are the things that the film is actually about humansfirst i wanna start off by saying that comparing this films cgi to godzilla minus one greatest godzilla film that actually made me care about humans budget wise is like an insult gmo had a budget near abouuuut  million or so while gxk had x the budget gmo managed to achieve winning an oscar with x less visual art employees and having the best and probably the most realistic large scale cgi ive seen ever but the cgi even with such a smaller film beating it is still excellent as always and doesnt look like some ps game that was reprogrammed to run on a nintendo switch unlike other films it has definitely been one of the consecutive aspects of the monsterversemonsters im a sucker for godzilla not so much kong but this version of him definitely catches my eye godzilla and shimo were what really brought this film together and the funny thing is before i saw godzilla with pink atomic breath it was my most disliked color but on him its my preferred look for him i also already loved cold related things so a big beast like shimo definitely made me see this filmbattle scenes now i know i know not all godzilla films can entirely be epic fight scenes im just saying i wish they were longer they are definitely what everyone including me came to see and i am beyond glad with the outcome of the film that i totally didnt see coming thats sarcasm and i actually would love to see more of the franchise whatever it may be also to anyone who disliked the movement speed of godzilla watch literally any dated godzilla filmin summary i love godzilla dune part two and gmo still beat it by an inconceivable number but if you like big monsters or just godzilla in general watch this maybe watch it again or just watch the fight scene clips
lets be honest i went in expecting this movie to be dumb but pretty entertaining just an average blockbuster fortunately this time it was so entertaining that you can ignore the dumb partsand of course its not an ambitious movie theres a lot of cliche oversimplification etc but i still expected worse most of the time humans are not acting like idiots their crazy ideas are pretty convincing within this world and the whole cast does a great job keeping us entertained relations between our human characters work pretty welltheres a lot of worldbuilding here successfull one in my opinion ancient civilization prophecies stories written on walls some scores to even the hollow earth looks great you can see how this whole ecosystems works with its own rulesand finally titans cgi is really good fight scenes dont disappoint and the most important thing monsters act like they should act theres startegy theres a lot of preparing but also theres hierarchy decisions made out of fear and fights for territory writers managed to make the titans seem humane while also staying within their animal nature the outcome of that is convincing at least for mesome people might have a problem with the fact that most of this movie is basically assembilng the team for the final battle but i think this time monsterverse used a cliche in pretty much the best way possiblein the end godzilla x kong is a satisfying and engaging blockbuster as well as great addition to the franchise i wonder how are they gonna beat that in the next one
"look nobody is watching these movies because they want water tight plots and engaging human stories were here because we want to see giant things smashing stuff upmovies like this are like a big mac its not real food but it has its placeit is a whole load of silly loud goofy funthe opening of this movie sees kong luring a pack of giant hollow earth hyena things into a complex mechanical trap he then takes a shower after covering himself in the blood of one of those giant hyena things having torn it in half whilst letting out a trademark intimidating roarthe first human moment sees jia the small girl from versus having some psychic visionsit is that ridiculousthere was a surprise death that was possibly the most telegraphed in history and a scene where a monarch monitoring station in hollow earth has been destroyed remember that hollow earth is huge mostly uncharted and full of giant monsters and the question is asked what could have done this
giant mechanical arm ex machina loads of explanation for stuff we didnt ought to have figured out magic mind control magic gravity controltheres a kind of anti gravity fight which is pretty decent and scenes of our favourite titans on rio beach giza and even having a nap in romes colloseumhonestly its ridiculous ridiculous and very enjoyable"
more than the enemy monsters they really added nothing to the film except annoyance dumb rehashed mcu jokes not even remotely amusing not even in the same league as the masterpiece like godzilla minus  this will be my last one of these types of godzilla movies they toss out tripe like this on a regular basis like ea churns out gaas games that ultimately get shut down within a year why because they are poop the cranston one was good then the farminga one wasnt bad though the milly brown family aspect made it cringe soon as we got to the ones with ms hall and skarsgard they went down the pan and in the gutter all flashy bright colors felt like we were watching iron man such a shame because godzilla kong and the creatures really tried to carry the human cast but every scene these collection of humans were in we wanted them to meet a grizzly end such a farcry from godzilla minus  directed by takashi yamazaki
in godzilla x kong the new empire the epic showdown between these two legendary titans feels like a nostalgic throwback to the classic showa era of godzilla films where the focus was on thrilling monster battles the film doesnt disappoint in this aspect as the fight sequences are incredibly wellexecuted and visually stunning capturing the raw power and scale of these colossal creatureswhat sets this film apart is its ability to balance the spectacle of the monster battles with a decent plot that keeps the audience invested while it may not break new ground in terms of storytelling the plot serves its purpose by providing enough context and stakes to drive the action forward it effectively sets the stage for the epic clash between the monsters making their confrontation feel earned and impactfulone of the standout aspects of the film is its breathtaking visual effects the cgi is topnotch seamlessly blending the massive creatures into their environments and delivering jawdropping action sequences that truly immerse the audience in the epic battle between the titans from the destruction of cityscapes to the intricate details of the monsters themselves the vfx work is nothing short of astonishingafter watching godzilla x kong the new empire im left wanting more the film delivers on its promise of entertainment offering a thrilling cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impression im already looking forward to revisiting the movie and eagerly anticipating future installments that continue to deliver the same level of excitement and spectacle overall godzilla x kong the new empire is a mustwatch for fans of monster movies and anyone looking for an exhilarating ride at the movies
absolute nonsense and anyone who didnt like godzilla vs kong will probably hate this i enjoyed myself the same way id enjoy eating two bags of potato chips in one sitting im feeling a bit empty and confused at why i did such a thing now its over but it was tasty junk at the timei feel like godzilla x kong the new empire has the least dialogue out of any giant monster movie of the last decade or so maybe longer it keeps the human characters at a minimum which is a doubleedged sword theyre not as frequently annoying but when you have a small cast of humans the sense of danger dissipates because no one is the kind of character that could die at any point before the very end and even then but all the scenes with the giant apes with no dialogue good stuff the humans are there to just explain stuff that doesnt really need to be explained i almost wish this had been a silent movietheres some good schlock here i laughed a lot theres a lot of action maybe too much it ends very suddenly the two titular monsters take a while to meet up and though i liked the main villain he takes too long to be introduced the narrative here is a mess and it only gets by through having so many different creatures fights and ridiculous scifi conceptsstill its not the kind of kaiju movie where people will complain that there werent enough monsters i feel like godzilla x kong provides plenty of dumb entertainment ridiculous spectacle and action to the point where watching it was never dull for a minute i had fun but looking back on it now it does feel like the cinematic equivalent of a lot of empty calories
huuuge godzilla fan since early smy  year old also loves these movies this looks like the budget version of the last one like its so bad we were laughing out loud in theater like its bad real bad compared to any of the other monster verse movies but its entertaining with some cool stuff itthey could of left out all human dialogue and it would of been at least a star better they both expect you so have watched and memorized all the other movies and somehow at the same time act like they other movies almost didnt exist i have a feeling this might be the end of the monster verse and maybe they have something else in mind because this was not cooked all the wayon any level
godzilla and kong a new empire is exactly what you are going to get a movie about kaiju finding their way in the world with the established notion of coexisting with humans on this planet here hollow earth is vastly explored with great visuals and kong delivers an exceptional performance the fight sequences are to the point and give great depth to the brutality of the situation on earth as a kaiju fan i could not ask for anything more than to see monsters go at it and save the planet such as any other monster movie people go see godzilla is true to form and is his usual reign of terror to other kaiju the human provide the skeleton of the story but the monsters carry it i had so much fun with this movie no need to go with the expectation of cinematic dialogue and epic depthjust sit back relax and watch monsters do their thing
ok so citizen kane it is notif you like big cgi monsters hitting each other for two hours then look no furtherif you liked the previous two godzilla kong movies then you will probably like this just check your brain in at the door before you dothe acting is patchy dan stevens steals every scene he is in and the little kid is annoying after a whilei was more shocked and surprised by the amount of people that the monsters would have killed by trashing rio and cairobut trying to look for logic in a movie like this is pointless just sit back and enjoy the madness and then forget about it immediately after
when asked what his plan is a character in godzilla x kong the new empire says throw everything at the wall and see what sticks director adam wingard has adopted this approach when making this film but on this occasion very little that is being randomly tossed about actually sticks the smackdowns between the films creatures are loud frantic and reasonably fun but the plot is a sloppy turd of titan proportions  a stinky contrived overblown mess brought to life in a maelstrom of not very convincing cgithe script is absolutely terrible and the majority of the film had me either scratching my head in confusion or laughing at its preposterousness kong being equipped with a metal fist is an undeniably cool idea but the fact that the protagonists just happen to have such a device on hand in hollow earth is just crazy especially one with built in antifrostbite serum a vet who knows how to extract a kong tooth also knows how to fly a hollow earth hover ship  clearly a man of many talents god only knows what the iwi tribe were up to with their glowing pyramids what was the deal with that glowing spike that nasty ape used to control the ice lizard and why did everyone suddenly start floating around in hollow earth there might have been explanations for some of these points but they became lost in all of the chaosafter godzilla minus one i suggest leaving all future films featuring the big lizard to the japanese rounded down to  for kaylee hottles perpetually anxious look  doesnt the girl have any other expressions
something is very wrong with american film making for some time nothing makes sense here intelligence of people is sharply underestimated on the level of insult and nothing really works with story this last film about monsters shows that while it is trying to draw some long forgotten mythology that works worse than in most cartoons for children under  human characters exist only to remind us of long forgotten cliches and definitely not of characters destroying the cultural and historical heritage of mankind is order of a day and in all that theres nowhere in the site possibility of simple just sit back and enjoy the rid what an insulting mess of corporate idiocy that beautiful queen under the surface and some fights do save this experience but the whole thing is not worth the effort at all
"pros
this movie is a saturday morning cartoon brought to lifethis is a s showa era film with modern effectsthe monsters are  the leadsthe monster brawls are absolutely nutsgodzilla vs kong round  was funthe entire rd act is exactly what  year old wouldve lovedcons
we are so far removed from the tone of the pacing is all over the placethe script was written with cocaine and mushroomsevery character is underdeveloped as is the plottheres no scale to any of the monster brawlslike every iteration of godzilla it starts serious then slowly becomes a kids franchise well the monsterverse is now officially a kids franchise for better or worse i say knowing full well that if i watched this as a kid it wouldve been the greatest movie ever however watching it as a  year old man i cant ignore the flaws this movie feels like a fever dream there are some big crazy ideas here but the movie doesnt hover over any of it they throw so much at you so quickly that you have no time to absorb anything before the movie is moving on the same goes for the characters who exist to deliver exposition and thats it a lowkey waste of rebecca halls talent the monsters are the opposite they are the leads of the movie this movie feels like kong  the hollow earth war there are long stretches where theres no dialogue and the story is being told through the expressions of the monsters and truthfully it works the monster fights are meant to be seen on the big screen especially a battle that takes place in zero gravity seeing godzilla and kong properly team up is something my inner child needed to see my theater cheered with joy as they charged into battle together this is the kind of movie that the young fans will absolutely love and theres nothing wrong with that i grew up on the showa era movies and thats exactly what this is this is the kind of monster movie that creates the next generation of fans with that in mind this movie does its job "
this is not your typical monsterverse movie my wife and i both agreed it was like watching a guardians of the galaxy movie it was entertaining and the soundtrack will be pretty good anytime you put kiss into a soundtrack it will be good i thought the monsters looked pretty good the steroid kong was pretty funny with his thanos gauntlet kind of excited to see baby kong going forward plus godzillas bed looks like my cats bed funny to see him sleep where he does twice hopefully they can go back to a more godzilla minus one type movie if i had any advise to future viewers see it during matinee times definitely not worth the full price
i think ive been spoiled by the masterpiece that was godzilla minus one going back to this ultra generic brainless  story nonsense is just disappointing i dont expect a great story but the dialogue was so bad and the story so pointless i almost wanted the humans dead so i didnt have to listen to them several uber generic rehashed mcu jokes that werent even funny i love godzilla and the monster verse started off great with brian cranston and that first godzilla film but since then its just slowly gotten worse imo like i said i knew this would be dumb and i went in with low expectations but left feeling almost insulted at how ridiculous and stupid it was i hate to say it because i love the idea of godzilla movies
you get what you paid for lots of cgi titans going scene by scene then culminating into a boffo end fight scene ive read some write ups online stating theres too much cgi the movie is centered around a fifty foot gorilla a sixty foot lizard and they are fighting other enormous titans in a world that does not exist great special effects great action and a its paced wellstory dont fool yourself the story is as thin as half of a single hair you came for the fictional animals fighting not enough godzilla that was a shame go see this if you are a fan of dumb popcorn films dont expect othello
i was surprised about how uninteresting i found a large parts of what should be a big dumb fun kaiju movie and certainly that wasnt what i felt about godzilla vs kong in fairness it picked up towards the end thougha signal coming from somewhere within the hollow earth causes godzilla to begin to strengthen himself for an upcoming battle within hollow earth kong unwitting reveals a deeper level that was previously sealed off and within that level are other giant apes ruled over by a tyrannical king skar kong challenges skar but is wounded in a losing effort desperate he heads to the surface to convince godzilla to join him in the battlethat all sounds pretty exciting i know but its all belaboured by a relatively boring middle section that we spend with the human characters exploring the hollow earth the humans themselves are actually pretty good dan stevens is great in everything and hes having a lot of fun here he has good chemistry with lifelong friend rebecca hall and with bryan tyree henry both of whom are reprising their roles from godzilla vs kong still though their voyage through hollow earth is lacking in peril or excitement whilst were here the monarch tv series established that time moves much slower in hollow earth than it does on the outside world  a fact that this film ignores entirelyit does as you might imagine pick up for a zero gravity multititan battle that takes place leading into the films climax from that moment on i was engaged with the film and enjoyed it through to the endingi dont know how helpful it is to compare this with godzilla minus one as despite sharing the same character they have very different objectives in the stories they tell but i did feel this was inferior to the last monsterverse film and im not sure where id take the series from here
the plot to godzilla x kong new empire is that below the earth are face painted tribal people who use crystals to control gravity and who are a looking for a psychic deaf girl because they need her to awaken a mother moth that shoots magical spider webs in order to unite old man king kong his minime and nuclear godzilla to stop a big red monkey with a bone bullwhip and an ice breathing lizard dogit would have been better if this plot had been all monster and no humans but like the rest of this universe its mostly humans who are dumb and unlikeable and stupid and in this one the humans are the most dumb and unlikeable and stupid than any of the previous filmsall four prior films had some charm this one lacks its super dumb and not worth seeing in theaters just stay home and dont watch
i would not talk about this part of the monsterverse except that i remained fascinated by this sequel and the origin of the hollow earth kong is the character in this part exactly as he should be a true leader who is ready to go to the end to save everyone he cares about is stopped in the course of the film an inexplicable connection with godzilla as well as with mothra is born which connects these two alpha titans in a unique wayscar king is one of the strongest antagonists out of all the parts although the movie comes together you havent seen half of it a merciless and terrible tyrant who stops at nothing for his throne i wont say anything about shimuo one of the greatest a titans this movie deserves everything recommendations and hopefully more parts in the future
the new empire is the latest installment in the monsterverse bringing together the iconic titans in an epic clash and uneasy alliance the films narrative dives into the discovery of a new threat emerging from the hollow earth prompting godzilla and kong to team up once more to defend the surface worldthe story unfolds with a fastpaced urgency as ancient secrets are unearthed and new monstrous adversaries rise while the plot is undeniably engaging it occasionally feels rushed lacking the depth and development that could have elevated the film from great to exceptional some story arcs could have benefitted from more screen time to fully flesh out the intriguing mythology that surrounds these legendary creaturesdespite this the cast delivers stellar performances across the board rebecca hall returns alongside brian tyree henry and kaylee hottle ensuring that the human element of the story remains strong amidst the colossal battles dan stevens also makes an appearance as trapper a pretty fun and interesting characterthe true stars however are the vfx and sfx teams the visual effects are nothing short of spectacular bringing the titans and their world to life with breathtaking detail and realism the sound design amplifies every roar and explosion immersing the audience in the heartpounding action the sheer scale and spectacle of the monster battles are aweinspiring making every clash a visual feastoverall godzilla x kong the new empire earns a solid  from me the film boasts a fantastic cast and phenomenal vfx and sfx ensuring a thrilling cinematic experience while the story could have benefitted from more nuanced development the movies strengths more than make up for its shortcomings fans of the monsterverse will undoubtedly appreciate this latest adventure and it sets the stage for even more exciting possibilities in future installments
i keep coming back to these movies over and over i love monster movies and can enjoy dumbfun action im the exact target audience how do they continue to fail aside from godzilla  they range from mediocre to terrible and gxk is no differenti know most reviews will compare this to godzilla minus one but i have to every single godzilla shot from minus one is better than every single shot of him in gxk every single action scene in minus one is better than every single one in gxk better story characters dialogue emotional investment everything minus one is better in every waythe worst thing i can say about gxk is i was so bored and i didnt care about anything that was happening zero investment this is partly because it doesnt really have a story stuff just happens halfway through i still didnt know what the story was about what conflict we might be heading to any kind of build up of a threatthey continue with another useless human plot completely formulaic and bland one of the only positives is a highly talented cast theyre just not given anything to work with rebecca hall is the only one who gets to show her talenteven worse is the  comedic attempts i laughed twice the nearly sold out crowd laughed a few times the rest made me cringe theyre like dad jokes the entirety of the human story is basically a kids moviewhat about the titans they rarely show the scale of these monsters most of the time its from the perspective of the monsters not the humans so they always look like theyre  feet tall with everything around just smallereven the movements are so fast like humans are fighting when they fall they fall in a second no groundshaking impact it feels so fake and nowhere close to epic im not anticgi but the big action scenes are hectic gibberishi give up it shouldnt be this difficult i dont even need it to be a good movie just entertaining with good action instead i get forgettable and dumb viewing opening thursday imax 
i like godzilla in general but i vastly prefer tohos output over legendarys franchise i thought the first  was mediocre and this was no different quality wise from its predecessorsthis film followed the footsteps of gvk and kotm by trying to fix the problem of the previous installment but mess up on something else the fight scenes in gvk were very dragged out so they tried to make it shorter however any action sequence with godzilla was just bland speaking of which godzilla legitimately felt like a regular old side character rather than a main character not to mention how he moves im not kidding when i say godzilla moves like he was crack his movements were just so weird and unnatural this was disappointing to me because i came here just because of godzilla and seeing him get sidelined was just crushingi can tell they tried to make this a great film because in the first act they put in a bunch of separate action sequences in between scenes trying to entertain the audience but as i said they were completely sided extremely short fights that really doesnt entertain us however the writers did come up with smart choices throughout the film and set up some of the twists well but the plot was so underwhelming  was the only mv film with a decent plot and it just went downhill from there dont even get me started with how they ended the film you are my home like what does that mean i know what the girl is trying to say but couldnt they figure out a better linespeaking of which this film has a lot of points that makes no sense from a logical perspective where does the hollow earth get light how did the tribe end up down there without any advanced technology how do they survive the high temperatures of inner parts of earth and the list goes onhowever they did nail at one thing kongs plot and his action scenes were legit very fun and entertaining albeit i felt like they didnt know how to start the opening so it was just kong chilling obviously i came to theaters to see godzilla not kong but i dont have much to complain about kong the team did think of creative ideas to get the fights going and so on even if it wasnt the best the human plot was a significant improvement over previous installments and the final battle was entertainingrating 
a roaring reverberating monster filled fiasco a gorgeous spectacle in the truest sense a visual extravaganza made for the biggest screen possibleits no less than a treat for the theaterloving audienceyes human characters leave a negligible impact the punchlines miss their mark most of the time but who really cares its a pleasure for your eyes and soulif youre a monsterverse fan like me and wished for more titan action trust me you are going to get out of the theatre with a big smile on your face your heart will be fulfilledyour inner child will be satisfieddont miss it
godzilla and kong wouldve made a great team but not a lot to convince that they would be honestly godzilla x kong the new empire is an okay movie but probably the weakest of the monsterverse movies so far the movie would mostly rely onto the story of kong that it has forgot to give a plot for godzilla the most we would see from godzilla is that he travels and thats it with not much new from him that and just like in the other monsterverse movies i really did not care for the human characters i felt they havent gotten a lot of character suitable for this movie the only ones i see does try to put effort to the movies purpose is jia however it can be well enough to be an exciting monster film with awesome battle scenes that feature abilities for each monster that they have along with great atmosphere for hollow earth id say that it can be a good movie for godzilla fans for the monster fights but if youre expecting this to be something like godzilla minus one i wouldnt set your expectations that high it was not that bad as it is for a monster movie but couldve done a lot more
godzilla x kong the new empire throws humanitys favourite giant monster brawl back into the ring but this titanic tussle feels more like a tired rehash than a worthy successor we open with the uneasy alliance between godzilla and kong tasked with protecting humanity from lurking threats however whispers of a hidden danger soon tear this fragile peace apart dragging our ape and atomic lizard into a clash for survivalthe films biggest strength lies in its breathtaking visuals the battles between godzilla and kong are undeniably impressive director adam wingard stages these showdowns with a chaotic energy taking us from the neondrenched streets of hong kong to the gravitydefying caverns of hollow earth the special effects are topnotch with both titans rendered in stunning detail godzillas atomic blasts illuminate the screen while kong swings through the air with a balletic grace that belies his immense sizeunfortunately the impressive visuals cant mask the films narrative shortcomings the plot feels cobbled together relying on tired tropes and predictable twists the human characters once again relegated to monster movie peanut gallery duty are given little to work with theres a valiant effort to establish a connection between kong and a newfound ape companion in hollow earth but its underdeveloped and ultimately inconsequential meanwhile bland dialogue and clichéd motivations make it hard to care about their fatethe pacing is another culprit the film lurches between slow expositionheavy stretches and frenetic action sequences the editing feels choppy at times leaving some fight choreography confusing and hard to follow the score by tom holkenborg junkie xl is a mixed bag while it boasts some pulsepounding tracks during the fights it lacks the thematic depth or memorable motifs that truly elevate a monster moviegodzilla x kong the new kong empire feels like a missed opportunity it evokes memories of classic monster brawls but fails to capture the spirit of what made them special while kaiju fans might find some enjoyment in the bigbudget slugfests the film ultimately disappoints with its forgettable story underdeveloped characters and uneven execution if youre looking for a monster movie masterpiece look elsewhere this ones best left on skull island
godzilla x kong the new empireits a smashing good time offering solid entertainment that meets the standards of what a monster flick should be theres nothing particularly fresh or new here just the familiar sights weve seen before the plot and characters are cookiecutter but theres a decent amount of fun mixed in the film tries to wreak havoc on multiple countries reminiscent of michael bays style turning it into a global crisis scenario but it doesnt quite hit those heights still its not as bad as feared and ultimately its just plain fun to watchits a good movie for family time
when you open a review by saying it looks good its never a good sign is it well godzilla x kong the new empire looks goodand thats about it really the story is basically the same old nonsense that hollywood has been propping their kaiju movies up with since forever people do things for inexplicable reasons the monsters  a fair number of them this time out  go bang crash lots of buildings fall down with presumably thousands of innocent people dying in the process and eventually everybody goes back to living their lives as if nothing untoward had happened just another day at the officeoh one plus is that we get to see the wonderful mothra thats always a good thing sadly we are alwaso introduced to baby kong yes thats every bit as bad as it soundshollywoods first godzilla movie to follow last years magnificent godzilla minus one was never gonna be easybut it should have been easier and better than this
the recent american godzilla films have not exactly been narrative driven thinkpieces but rather monsteronmonster brawlers if you want monster action the new empire has it in spades and is easily the most beautiful of the four recent films the titans every one of them looks eyewateringly outstanding an absolute standout being mothra who remains as gorgeous as she was in king of the monstersgodzilla looks great and his new colour palette is especially amazing and though he gets top billing in the title he is sidelined in his own film in favour of kong dont get me wrong kong is a good draw in this film in his pursuit to hopefully find other giant apes in the hollow earth a realm which is as epic as the monsters that reside there it just would have been good to see more of our favourite lizard toothough the effects will absolutely be the number one reason to see this film the story script and human characters are certainly not the script is the most contrived convenient mess this addition to the franchise has ever seen example we need special item  lucky it is right next to us though we never mentioned it before until now becausereasonsa massive thing missing from this monster movie is a heart the first two films had ken watanabes serizawa a sole believer in godzilla and the titans who fought for coexistence between monsters and humanity the third entry had millie bobby browns madison who exhibited an undying faith in godzilla when others did not this film yeah none of thatrebecca hall does her best as dr andrews and despite the occasional moment where she can flex her acting muscles lets face it she deserves better than this she is normally used as an exposition tool simply telling us the backstory and describing what will happen next think of the film this way  there is a big monster scene then dr andrews will explain why and what happens next  then there will be another monster scene  rinse and repeatbryan henry and dan stevens share the role of comedic relief though it is ron smyck as harris who arguably had some of the best lines and deserved more screen time the film at times often feels like a comedy more than an action feature trying to squeeze in as many funny lines as a marvel filmthe music is of course as on point as ever  a bombastic score that makes every setpiece that much more entertaining but thats all this film has  it is the most beautiful and colourful the monsterverse has ever been  but it is shallower than any puddle youll find
comparing this film to minus one seems odd because theyre completely different this movie is filled with action and takes clear inspiration from the showa era godzilla films on the other hand minus one is more serious in tone while this one is to put it mildly a bit goofy if you expect the same level of seriousness from both films youll likely be let down by this one however if you go into it expecting a silly fun movie thats exactly what youll get theres nonstop monster action throughout the film with barely a minute break from seeing monsters on the big screen ultimately understanding and embracing the unique qualities of each film is key to enjoying them to the fullest
the last film of the series which first deals with two great legendary creatures one by one and then brings them together in a single film godzilla x kong the new empire was released if you are interested in the creature concept and especially mega creature fights you may think this movie is for you you may want to watch the monsters that you were afraid of when you saw them on television when you were little to experience the same feeling when you grow up or you may want to take your children to the movie of the toys that they are most likely to buy on hamburger menus and show them this movie as the transformers of the period in any case you would be wrong  we will explain how it happened in the next part of the article with comments containing even a little spoilerlets go in order first of all we have an action movie in front of us this movie does not contain horror elements like the godzilla and king kong films of the horror genre of the fifties nor like s king kong with jack black or s japanreleased godzilla its not that the movie fails to be scary its that it doesnt even consider being scary godzilla and kong who are referred to as titans instead of creatures monsters etc in the movie exist as mythological heroes throughout the moviecontrary to horror the film gives the impression that it is designed as an action movie that can be watched by the whole family it contains very wild images for the young audience especially with scenes of kong hunting in his natural life and especially dismembering his prey although the green mucous fluid effect was used instead of blood in the scenes where kong divides the giant jackals or the sea monster in half in order to reduce the apparent brutality this eliminates the possibility of calling the film a childrens moviein a way the movie follows the same formula as transformers  creatures from space or underground emerge and some of them want to take over the earth while others fight against them on behalf of humanity here kong in particular seems like the good autobots that its probably easier to attribute human characteristics to a mammalian ape than to a coldblooded lizard the difference between godzilla x kong and transformers is that everything from character structure to jokes is presented to the audience in a more filtered and simplified way this situation which causes too much simplification leads to moments in the film that cannot be explained to anyone such as the bernie character being allowed to join the journey to the hollow worldwhile there is an explanation in the story for the primary schoolage character jias obligation to return to the hollow earth there is no explanation for a civilian like bernie endangering his life just because he wants to likewise for kong who is expected to fight against the greatest danger ever on earth while putting on that mecha glove which was previously shown in the poster and in every promotional material on the hand of kong whose hand has ice burns there is no answer to the question of why the rest of the mecha armor in question was not used the audience is expected to say only one glove was made and it probably fell on kongs injured hand although we will not list all of the open doors one by one here there are plenty of examples similar to these two in the moviethe inconsistency is noticeable not only in the story but also in the visual language although very successful visual effects were used in the previous movie of the series godzilla vs kong  which was also shot by the same director  this movie is where almost everything except people is cgi it contains visuals like an atari game plugged into a tube television the visual effects of the entire hollow world are not pleasing to the eye except for godzilla kong and kongs other baby monkey who look serious even though they lack fine detail especially the other dinosaur which is capable of starting an ice age appears with an animation quality that can only be seen in b movies shot by small film studios with the help of friends indeed the film has a high ranking among the films released in  but remains relatively small due to the brand it deals with and its goal of becoming a blockbuster it has a budget of  million dollars the visual problems do not end with the fact that the creatures look like poorly animated pokemon like the creatures that come out of the pokemon ball and pose the creatures in this movie constantly need to get to high places and pose but the sloppy editing and camera angles result in the axis being distortedthe film whose action scenes and climax points are obviously rushed instead of long action sequences it looks like a collection of scenes taken from different movies with short and excessive action scenes in other words it seems like the aim is to short videos to be shared on youtube or social media instead of the integrity of the movie the film which resembles many works such as avatar  journey to the center of the earth  and god of war in many respects cannot fully integrate what it takes from these works into its own visual world the use of visual effects which is the biggest expectation from this movie fails to please the audience and send them homeit feels like adam wingard who attracted attention with a horror movie like youre next or the previous movie of this series godzilla vs kong did not have the opportunity to put what was on his mind on the screen this time it seems that the series will continue after the godzilla x kong movie which will be more enjoyable if you lower your expectations and go to the cinema to have an event all we have to do is wait for the last movie of planet of the apes which will be released a month from now 
ive watched some trash in my time but this is amongst the worst compared to the excellent godzilla minus one this really is an insult to anyones intelligence i wasnt expecting much cgi fighting cgi was the premise and thats what i was expecting but even that was plodding and boring the bits inbetween with the humans was just terrible terrible acting terrible exposition i just had enough of it by about half way through the most the critics could say about this film was that it was fun but i didnt find much fun in it the jokes didnt land and the cgi didnt have any of the excitement or impact i expected
this installment was fairly boring for much of the running time the acting was wooden and when the actors suddenly feel the need to extrapolate to show why what just happened was significant then you know you have mediocre talent writing your storyline and some of those aspects of the monsterverse had gotten downright silly recently all of them involving kong last movie he got a monkey axe this one he gets a metal armored upgrade for an arm he couldnt use from a monarch employee who just happened to have some unused monkey tech lying around how convenient none of which address the fact kongs arm was now frostbitten and basically useless before not any more hes fine now he packs a dandy punch ah well the movie is about kaiju so i suppose expecting reality to make an appearance is expecting too much but sooooo much extrapolation many many examples abound hard to list them here without giving too much away basically my review comes down to this the last  minutes or so is pretty good and action packed before that well its tedious at best and poorly written its pretty eye candy but youll owe your brain an apology afterwards
adam wingards sequel to godzilla vs kong is filled to the brim with nonstop action and adventure the film focuses primarily on kong as godzilla takes a back seat until the end of the movie the main narrative is that a team led by rebecca hall and dan stevens embark on a journey to the hollow earth to decipher a mysterious signal meanwhile kong is on a journey to find more of his kind the cast does well despite playing somewhat generic characters it is however very clear that the filmmakers principal focus is the spectacle and the story is just a vehicle for the epic fight scenes the fight scenes are indeed epic however as the monstrous titans engage in multiple colossal battles throughout the film i think the film may have tried to balance too many ideas though including the emotional story involving rebecca halls character and her daughter there was just not enough buildup of the human storyline to make the conclusion rewarding all in all godzilla x kong the new empire is a fun popcorn movie delivering spectacular action and nothing more
"let me get one thing out of the way pink is the highest energy wavelength meaning godzilla was at his most powerful in that scene with kongnow for the review godzilla x kong the new empire took great liberties to tell a story that felt like a typical take on what this captivating franchise is known forif you believed at any point that something looked noncredible or felt silly then you havent seen some of the classicera movies featuring godzillathis mutated radioactive lizard has had his good bad and crazy days in movieland so watching him pull a few weird moves in godzilla x kong didnt come across as altogether strangemuch the same could be said of kong who was essentially a smart kaijugorilla who managed to survive in conditions that no human ever could with all we know so far about his journey kong has a bizarrely balanced intellect just short of speaking he seems capable of higher thought something i saw a lot of in this movie as wellnot only did new empire live up to its name it captured iconic kaijugrade teamups between godzilla and kong and it didnt stop there even mothra came on the scene and delivered some goosebumpy thrillsa prophecy connecting skull island manifested through jia the last of the tribe that once lived there she reawakened kaijumothra who was key to helping kong and godzilla realize their jointguardianship potentialthe scifi plot next saw godzilla and kong teaming up to take on a ruthless foe the apechief known as the scar king he was part of kongs species but not as keen on coexistence the backstories were engaging in this regardsome hitherto unknown secrets cropped up in the story there were some intriguing connections that linked the scar king godzilla and kong in ways that were primal and memorablethey also went a step beyond hollow earth and showcased a previously uncharted subsubterranean realm the iwi tribe an unknown prehistoric human civilization soon became another thrilling addon to the script not to forget other apes similar to kong  who up to this point was the last of his kindmonarch too played a vital role in the movie one that made me see them in a new light they continued to monitor all things anomalous especially in regard to keeping kong and godzillas paths from crossing then there was that outstanding freezepowered shimo titanterritorial battles were still in focus implying how the kaijus in question were more attuned to their animal instincts than anything genuinely evolutionaryi loved all the creature designs in the movie they deserve their own bestiary  book merch recommendation speaking of books john scalzis  novel the kaiju preservation society contained so many unforgettable moments similarities to which i enjoyed watching in godzilla x kongthe movie retained the idea of using kong to go up against various monsters that threatened human existence this was not new in the new empire but a trope that has been covered before in the franchiselike i stated before this monsterverse took plenty of liberties to create a popculture mashup for the fans they also catered to the conspiracy nerds in the crowd when they explored a variety of hollow earth sequencesin a lot of ways godzilla x kong the new empire was both an extinction warning and an origin story ironically it took two giant monsters that couldve ended us all and made them save us insteadplenty of other noteworthy moments glazed with extraordinary cgi and garnished with generous action sequences made godzilla x kong the new empire a triumph in fantasyscifi entertainmentnobody in their right minds can call this a strictly credible plotline but credibility is not why we root for a giant radioactive reptile that once had a fondness for destroying half of tokyo but has since taken his travel plans globalas for kong even hed have been surprised if someone told him hed finally leave that dang island and go see the world  only to end up inside itgodzilla x kong the new empire was an anthropomorphized crossoverstyle extravaganza that captured numerous nuanced bits and bobs that have rendered its iconic kaijus famous among fandoms all over the worldin this monsterverse they took a superintense duo and let them indulge in a superinsane duet with other dancers contributing their own jigs in a show that was literally too big for broadway

there are two plotlines that interject at certain points the kong tribe plotline and the chosen one plotline the chosen one plotline is some of the cringiest boring nonsense imaginable while the kong tribe plotline is actually servicablekong looks cool and the cg battles and fighting look pretty damn good but as soon as the battle scenes end and kong is replaced by the humans it all falls apartim a bad mom boohoo this is the main focus of the human plotline it is insufferable and also the little girl is the best and she is actually the chosen one wow incredible the girl is the key to everythingalso it never ceases to be comical to see a fight scene in a massive city inhabited by millions of people when you know that every building destroyed results in the thousands of deaths and instead of it being a horror movie it is a fun family action film it just makes me look around wondering if everyone is watching the same movie as i am this is like  times  the greatest national tragedy in brazilian history but instead everyone cheers okay thenthere is maybe  minutes of entertaining stuff here all of it includes kong but even those parts are mediocre this is the kind of slop netflix buys from india and throws them on the netflix kids but instead they made it into a full on movie christ almighty even the later transformers movies were leagues better than this absolute stinker of a movie
i sat down to watch the  movie godzilla x kong the new empire and i was actually just expecting to be another runofthemill recent times monster bash movie as the newer movies with godzilla and king kong has proved to be now dont get me wrong because i have thoroughly and genuinely enjoyed the recent movies by all means but they were not really outstandingand then director adam wingard brought godzilla x kong the new empire to the table holy monster bash batman what a phenomenal surprise of a movie this turned out to be i have to say that i was blown away by this movie and i had not seen a movie of this magnitude making its appearance i was fully and wholly entertained throughout the course of the  minutes that the movie ran forthe storyline in godzilla x kong the new empire as written by terry rossio simon barrett jeremy slater and adam wingard is pretty straightforward but what works here in comparison to the many previous newer godzilla andor king kong movies was that this movie was all amount titans fighting one another and the human storylines were mere backdrops that worked so well for me because the insane amount of action in terms of titans fighting throughout the course of the movie was amazing and it made the movie work on such a great level for me seeing godzilla and king kong fighting or either of them fighting other titans now that is why i sit down to watch movies such as this and oh boy did director adam wingard deliver herthe acting performances in the movie are good and i have to say that i wasnt really overly familiar with any of the actors or actresses on the cast list sure ive seen some of them before but am not all that familiar with their previous work kaylee hottle playing kia and fala chen playing the iwi queen definitely put on memorable performances with their characterssomething that is important for a monster bash movie such as godzilla x kong the new empire are special effects and wow i was beyond amazed here the cgi in the movie is phenomenal and it looks so great and realistic and the sheer amount of mayhed and destruction throughout the course of the movie almost had me cheering in the cinema this is definitely the most intense kaiju movie or titans as they are called in this movie i have ever seen and that alone makes it more than wellworth sitting down to watch godzilla x kong the new empiregodzilla x kong the new empire is how kaiju or titan movies are supposed to be and this particular movie from director adam wingard was simply amazing this is a movie that i strongly and warmly recommend you to go watch do it in the cinema because the sounds of the titans roaring and battling is so wellworth getting shook through from the cinema speakers i loved that about the movie as welli am a fan of this movie no doubt about it and when i walked out of the cinema it was with a big wow are you kidding me feel because adam wingards  movie godzilla x kong the new empire was overthetop and exactly how such a movie should bemy rating of godzilla x kong the new empire lands on a rocksolid nine out of ten stars
a filmmaker could have demonstrated better judgment in selecting the cast the cgi is top notch still it remains perplexing who authorized the casting decisions particularly the expressionless demeanor of the team including the child artist whose acting falls short however a positive aspect is that her performance may inspire confidence in aspiring actors  if she can make it to hollywood then believe me anyone can the screen time allotted to the actors was limited leaving room for improvement a more adept short film crew could have potentially achieved better resultskudos to the cgi team every moment is enjoyable except for the liveaction performancesnote   star just for the cgi
"previews movies are better there are no twist and turns just
simple story it fully based upon  main characters elevation eventhough it should be worked but it didnt there is no epic ending in which godzilla vs kong had for epic ending there should be twists and turning points like mechagodzilla came and beaten godzilla and kong but in this film there is no like that balance its just  titans are fighting and suddenly ended it doesnot satisfies itdoesnot make you bore you can have fun time but it is a small movie with  minutes we need more runtime while going to theatres then only it staisfies with money we paid for ticket"
"im not going to spoil the movie here because is something that you need to see in the big screen whit your family and friends but man this movie has a lot monster fight and action that you will not be disappointed godzilla and kong are totally badass in this movie in this one i love that jia return she is the best human character in this movie just like in the godzilla vs kong the movie kept me entertained all the time through the whole movie and the visuals and design are amazing in this movie and something im going to say there are a lot lore in the hollow earth that has to be explored
 amazing ⭐"
godzilla x kong the new empire directed by adam wingard continues the monsterverse saga with mixed results the film while visually stunning and actionpacked struggles with its narrative and character development the returning cast includes rebecca hall as dr ilene andrews and brian tyree henry as podcaster bernie hayes joined by newcomer dan stevens who plays a charismatic kaiju veterinarianstevens portrayal of trapper a titan doctor adds a humorous and laidback vibe to the film his character however feels underdeveloped and underutilized despite this stevens chemistry with hall provides some of the films more enjoyable human momentsthe films visual effects are its standout feature particularly the sequences involving kongs journey in hollow earth and his interactions with a younger ape named suko these scenes showcase wetas impressive cgi work and add emotional depth to kongs character however godzilla often takes a backseat primarily appearing during chaotic destruction scenes until the climactic battlethe introduction of skar king as the new antagonist arrives too late in the narrative which diminishes the potential for a more developed conflict between him and kong despite the delayed setup the final showdown delivers on the franchises promise of epic crowdpleasing monster battles the climactic fight between godzilla kong and skar king is thrilling featuring stunning visuals and highenergy action that fans will appreciateoverall godzilla x kong the new empire excels in delivering spectacular monster battles and impressive visual effects however it falls short in narrative cohesion and character development making it a visually entertaining but somewhat shallow addition to the monsterverse
cinematography the cinematography in the film was a standout it utilized different types of lenses eg wide angle and different camera focuses with some blur in the background it was innovative on one hand but not over the top the closeups and medium shots were greatediting and pacing editing was commendable sometimes the pacing keeps me engaged but then the narrative structure does not always keep up with plot twists and character arcs that feel aimless or underdeveloped at timessound and music sound and music play pivotal roles in setting the tone with the electronic score punctuating the epic battles and quiet moments alike however the choice to abruptly cut music in some of the scenes detracts from the cohesion of the films soundscape leaving a disjointed impression that the rest of the soundtrack struggles to mend in the second act the soundtrack was very generic it sounded similarly to what you can hear in typical superhero films with a heroic vibe the whole second and third acts felt like a generic viewing experiencevfx visual effects are where the film shines brightest crafting a world that is at once familiar and fantastically alien the vfx was innovative and pushed the boundaries of the genrecgi the reliance on cgi is super heavy on one hand some cgi moments were great but on the other hand as the movie progressed it became so much that i didnt want to watch it anymore because it looked generic it feels like i am watching an animation film using too much cgi instead of real locations can sometimes break the immersive experience the use of more authentic natural landscapes could benefit the filmcast the cast was incompetent it often felt misplaced or unable to fully embody the largerthanlife characters they portray which exacerbates this in other words it felt like i was watching actors from a  parody moviecostume design the characters costume design was terrible they could have created unique costume designs for the characters such as having the same for everyone while travelingthe movies emotional and intellectual engagement was inconsistent mysticism and technology are both big ideas in the movie but the story is both big undeveloped and hard to follow i wish this film had more depth meaningfulness and clarity also godzilla had less screen time which is sadin conclusion godzilla x kong the new empire is a mixed bag there is too much going on and every detail eg large small or microscopic is difficult to digest through visual storytelling individuals seeking a narrative with depth and coherence not just smashing things might feel it falls short in that aspect although the film has flaws it showcases the progress in vfx
the latest installment in the monsterverse godzilla x kong delivers on its promise of spectacular kaiju battles and jawdropping visual effects the titanic clash between the two iconic monsters is undeniably entertaining providing fans with the epic showdown theyve been eagerly anticipating however despite its strengths the film leaves some crucial questions unanswered particularly regarding the concept of aging in the hollow earth as touched upon in the monarch tv seasonfirstly the movie excels in its action sequences the battles between godzilla and kong are choreographed with precision showcasing the immense power and unique abilities of each titan the special effects are topnotch bringing these legendary creatures to life in a way that is both aweinspiring and terrifying the sound design complements the visuals perfectly making each roar and clash resonate with the audiencethe human characters often a weak point in kaiju films are serviceable here while their storylines can feel secondary to the monster action the cast does a commendable job of keeping viewers engaged the exploration of the hollow earth is particularly intriguing offering a glimpse into a mysterious and vibrant world that adds depth to the monsterverse lorehowever the film stumbles when it comes to integrating the broader mythology established in the monarch tv season one glaring issue is the concept of aging in the hollow earth the tv series hinted at the unique temporal properties of this subterranean realm suggesting that time might function differently there this intriguing idea had the potential to add a fascinating layer to the story but godzilla x kong fails to address it adequatelyas the characters delve deeper into the hollow earth one cant help but wonder how does aging work in this environment are the creatures and ecosystems affected by time in the same way as those on the surface the movie provides no clear answers leaving fans of the franchise with lingering questions this oversight feels like a missed opportunity to enrich the narrative and explore the implications of such a unique settingin conclusion godzilla x kong is a solid entry in the monsterverse that delivers where it counts in the epic monstrous mayhem the visual spectacle and the sheer scale of the battles make it worth watching for fans of the genre however its failure to address the intriguing concept of aging in the hollow earth as introduced in the monarch tv season and its occasionally uneven pacing prevent it from reaching its full potential with a bit more attention to detail and storytelling cohesion this movie could have been a true titan of its genre
ive had a good fun during this movie its important to recognise that godzilla x kong is purely entertainment and special effects focused at times there are too many effects and actionpacked moments that movie is dragging us into  at the cost of some more interesting aspects such as for example a bit more constructive interactions between the main characters learning their stories motive etcthere isnt time for that really because this movie doesnt slow down and the time ends up passing rather fastthats why you should not expect too demanding plot it doesnt have too much depth yet it manages to remain sensible enough to make a decent storyline that can be followed ive totally enjoyed getting immersed in getting to know the worlds created in this movie
 i did not have any expectations whatsoever before watching the film  after the trailers dropped i was kind of disappointed  but it was one hell of a ride in the theatres really enjoyed it it is fun  action  packed  it has comedy  two or more gigantic monsters fighting on the big screen and it was damn fun kong is the main focus of the story and it does make sense because he is a character that can connect with people the human characters are actually likable in this one especially brian tyree henry as bernie and dan stevens as trapper rebecca halls character dr irene andrews is good aswell but the main thing i loved about the film was its epic climax it was great overall the film is fun and entertaining thats all
pretty much what was expected with lots of kaiju action and big destructive fight scenes the three plotlines each have their merits and tie together nicely but it did slow the pace in the middle and the big showdown at the end felt a bit anticlimactic most of it was a bit silly but it was entertaining and fun with good special effects plenty of action and ample lighthearted moments the human characters were annoying but bearable but the spectacle of the setting and human side of kong made up for it its a great world theyve created with monarch and hollow earth but there is only so much you can get out of the overall premise
i awaited for this movie for such a long time and oh boy i was more than astonished this movie is an emotional roller coaster blending extremely exciting action with touching bonds and epic team upssuko kongs loyal companion who is like a son to him steals a spotlight for me he is so cute and shows his loyalty and affection towards kong godzillas and kongs eventual team up is what we all wanted for so many years for these two iconic titans to fight together against skar king and one other formidable foethe introduction of the main antagonist of the movie skar king is very interesting i really like the concept of this antagonist as he will bring some emotions to the character as well which is very interesting for a titan to have such human like behavior and also adds a whole new layer of excitement to the movie with later putting one of the best monster battles ever brought from a moviebut whats truly sets this movie apart is its heart amidst the chaos and destruction of the epic monster battles there are moments of pure emotion between the titans and the humans and what brings the new empire is the new bonds that were made between the characters for methis is by far the best addition to the monsterverse yet it has all that we asked for and its truly a masterpiece thank you legendary this will probably be one of my favorite movies ever made and you must watch this on imax for the best experience d
starts off as and sadly that hue does stay during most of the movie another runofthemill generic hollywood tentpole blockbuster from the weightless cgi looks to the boring dialogue and characters the first act of godzilla x kong didnt do much for me however as the film progresses it started to show off its bonkers ideas and charms one by one and slowly  ultimately managed to win me over this cinematic universe slowly drifted away from its dark grounded almost disastermovielike origins of godzilla  as it went on and after watching gxk you wouldnt believe theyre even set within the same continuity gone are the rains dust and nighttime battles of king of the monsters or the vibrant operatic cinematography larry fong achieved in skull island in gxk  of the battles are set in broad daylight and the camera spins cuts and turns upside down director adam wingard goes crazy in some shots to maximize and display these battle of titans in a cartoonlike manner you are basically being waterboarded with cgi spectacle and thats not a bad thing as someone who was turned off by the way godzilla ran in the first trailer i kinda do miss the old aesthetic of the monsterverse but i cant deny that what they achieved in gxk is helluva fun i was basically cheering inside during the third act they cut off all the bs mostly and solely focused on delivering a bonkers digital fantasylike colosseum for the titans to punch and throw each other also notable is the role of kong as basically the protagonist of the movie contrary to godzilla who gets less screentime and is treated more like a force of naturebeast he is kong acts feels and emotes more like a human there is an interesting contrast between kongs humanlike and godzillas animalistic behavior most of kongs scenes works as a dialoguefree fantasy action film about a lone warrior wandering this fantasy world and bonding with a childhollow earth where exotic creatures dwell ancient hidden civilization in there huge temples built with shining crystals hidden lore of monsters portals giant monkey tyrant riding an ice dragon antigravity action sequence and historic landmarks being destroyed disastermoviestyle you can not fully be on board with the new direction but you cant deny its charm and funalso forgot to mention godzilla fighting an radioactive sea dragon in the arctic think this maybe qualifies as a gonzo blockbuster
look with a title like that you can understand the internets disappointment when the two titular titans dont kissthe fact that godzilla x kong comes so soon after minus one redefined what it means to be a godzilla film the new empire looks more and more like the bigger dumber cousin youre mother would insist you play with when you were a child if im honest you come to this film for the sheer kaijusmashing spectacle and not much else because it doesnt have much else to offer it starts with a lot of promise but takes itself too seriously and becomes tediously long and drawn out also barely any godzilla in this godzilla movie dan stevens and brian tyree henry are desperately trying to make this onedimensional material work i thank them for their service as they were easily the most likeable part of the cast meanwhile adam wingards direction is nothing special and junkie xl sounds like he fell asleep on his synthesisers half the time ultimately leaving godzilla × kong feeling like the lesser parts of the showa era dumb fun with nothing much to cut your teeth into and not a lot worth giving a damn about
everyone is just comparing godzilla x kong the new empire with godzilla minus one which is such a bad move these two films have completely different tones and should not be compared legendary can make godzilla movies with godzilla s tone but we must also welcome something different the action sequences are out of this world and cgi too human characters are not the best in legendarys monsterverse so we should get over that by now be sure to watch it on the big screen the vibrance is also an another feature of this film that makes me fall in love with it maybe it wont be received well by the critics but the audience makes the movie successful and the the audience will love it a thumbs up from me 👍
the epitome of turning your brain off this film is ridiculous and it knows it it fully leans into the campiness and fun of the situation and thus the film is a fun time overallthe highlight is definitely kong and his plot line this film and godzilla vs kong have him be the main focus and the film does a good job with conveying his thoughts and feelings with little to no dialogue sort of his journey feels the most fleshed out and the villain is probably has the most personality of any monsterverse antagonist in contrast godzilla gets very little other than going around killing monsters and helping out in the rd actwith the focus more squarely on the monsters we get a lot more action and its pretty good the cgi is great and the action choreography is pretty good as well the plot simply acts as a means to get from one fight to the other with no attention for consistency or logicunfortunately the major drag of this film like many monsterverse films are the humans they all exist to spout exposition state the obvious or intervene at a pivotal moment in the story they have very little character and their arcs are pathetic the only bright spot is trapper who feels like just the kind of character the monsterverse needs more of someone who sees everything ridiculous going on and seems to be enjoying every second of itoverall godzilla x kong is exactly what you thought it would be turn your brain off for  hours and simply bask in the ridiculous premise and the epic monster fights
when i was a kid in mid nineties i watched godzilla and dragon movies in theatres and was mesmerized so i took my kids to this movie with high expectations but this turned out to be a huge disappointmentthere is no logic no realistic situation and no serious story telling attemptits like ok let us get godzilla and kong together and add some good vfx its more than enoughwe were expecting some real badass character against godzilla kong since it was hyped that not even godzilla  kong can defeat this characterbut this character turned out to be a dud and didnt live up to the hype not even to a small extentwhole movie is without any logic it is as if the vfx guys came up with some series of events while making the graphicsthere is one scene where the space ship captain is killed what other team members do just continue with their exploration without even sparing a moment of thought for their fellow mate and how do they return back in the space ship later the dentist flies the space ship just like that random characters do stuffs like we see in cartoon for toddlerswhen kong gets hurt they already have a perfect solution in place they exactly knew that such a thing is gonna happen as if they had done a time travel and got the tech readywe can list many such bloopers it completely fails to connect with audiences even my  year old son started pointing out such stupid acts and asking me the reason i didnt have any answerplease get some good script writing team into action even if you need to do away with some vfx members for the sake of getting an engaging stuff we have enough of this vfx stuffs where we need to lay our brain to rest

my daughter and i caught godzilla vs kong the new empire  at the theaters this evening the plot delves into king kongs journey in hollow earth as he searches for others of his kind only to discover a species with intentions to dominate earth meanwhile a monarch agent cares for a young girl from kongs island who shares a unique bond with the giant ape and believes hes in danger determined to help kong the agent leads a mission to hollow earth to uncover the truth and potentially save himdirected by adam wingard known for youre next the film features rebecca hall from the town brian tyree henry from bullet train dan stevens from the guest and kaylee hottle from godzilla vs konggodzilla vs kong boasts an abundance of cgi reminiscent of guardians of the galaxy or jurassic park which surprisingly worked for me the film successfully navigates the challenge of uniting kong and godzilla in a way that should meet expectations of fans of the monster universe this picture is filled with exhilarating and visually stunning monster fights that are the highlight of the film godzillas presence is particularly impressive and kongs battle upon arrival in subterranean earth is an epic standout moment the evolution of the baby gorilla is fun to watch too the film pays homage to historic godzilla films with numerous easter eggs while the storyline is adequate and essentially takes a backseat to the monster action there are numerous sequences that only work because this is a monster universe movie and cant be taken seriously however the solid performances from brian tyree henry and dan stevens provide enjoyable comic relief to offset any overdone scenes additionally the soundtrack is solid and the concluding battle elicited an applause from the audience including my daughteroverall godzilla vs kong the new empire is a wellexecuted american addition to the monster universe that warrants a viewing i would rate it  and recommend giving it a watch
i have to say that this movie is totally entertaining and a good movie for time spending with family nothing heavy nothing complicated easy to watch so just enjoy your time with a bucket of pop corn and watch this moviekayle hottle is so lovable cute and pretty while her acting is not much but she got what it takesdan stevens the character is way too cool and easy for him but his charm says it all since the beginning to the endthe cgi is very good so enjoyable and definitely not too cartoonthe storytelling is so easy nothing complicated for everyone to enjoy and be happy with all the problem solving provided
godzilla x kong the new empire is exactly what you expect it to be big dumb and loud monster fights for some people this might work  if you love some of that rock em sock em transformerslike largescale action youll get what you came foreventually otherwise this was a gigantic waste of time a silly pointless illogical and soulless film that is missing everything that makes these iconic characters special it was like watching a kid play with their godzilla and kong toys theres no substance to it i loved gareth edwards  godzilla film with its excellent visual style and sense of scale and tone but this is no longer that no disrespect meant to director adam wingard  its visually incoherent and lacks any sense of scale or weight its almost like its become a cartoon of what it once was and honestly i think godzilla minus one broke the monsterverse for me im more interested in deeper stories that use these creatures in more intelligent ways godzilla x kong is mostly fine but its cinematic junk food and the epitome of empty calories the novelty has worn off and the sense of gigantic scale is lost with too much time in hollow earth plus im just really not into the big monkey punches big lizard fights anymore some will love this but its just not for me if you liked the first godzilla vs kong then youll for sure like this a little too dumb and mindless with nothing else really going for it heck godzilla and kong only appear intermittently in the first  mins which is bogged down with boring human exposition before our titans even share the screen when they do its one of the most ridiculous anticlimactic generic teamups imaginable nonetheless its hard not to be entertained watching giant monsters fight and at least they do this well as rotten tomatoes summarizes come to godzilla x kong the new empire for the sheer monstermashing spectacle  and stay for that too because the movie doesnt have much else to offer

"good thing to say about this film the truth is that i didnt have many expectations in terms of the script but there is no where to take it 😂if your intention is to see an intelligent film with script twists this is undoubtedly not your filmnow if youre looking for an epic fight between a radioactive lizard and a monkey youre going to get what youre looking forin this installment two new creatures join in against which our protagonists have to fight hand in hand kong and gozillato finish with the review i am going to give my grade based onscript

acting of actors final grade "
this is very entertaining movie with lots of big boss fights and all the action you could possibly handle seeing this at the cinema was a great ride not perfect movie in any form or way but having a few beers and watching big huge monsters fight is something specialthe negatives are that the cgi is not always perfect but it does not matter too much another thing is that the first team going down under seem inadequate not really the people at least not alone you should send on this type of mission the third thing is that things get a bit too much the characters are over the top the dentist dude is way over the top the action is over the top we do not only have big freaking monsters fighting we have an ice monster aiming to bring in a new ice age we have some alien things weird anti gravity technology and humans just happen to have a big freaking mechanical arm ready for kong  which of course is a perfect fit it all culminate in a enormous fight on earths surface which is also over the topextremely entertaining but otherwise kinda meh still the best of the franchise so far and it is hard to really complainthis is not an intellectual movie and will never win any awards but whooooooo cares you wanted a huge monster movie with big monsters fighting and that is what you get for this type of movie but a lower score otherwise also a must see in the theatre  the sound design is amazing
what a fun surprise im not a faithful kaiju fan though i have seen enough info to at least know what the showa era style is when this movie was announced i didnt think this is where they were going but i think they did pretty good for adapting that style to a modern big screen also it shouldnt have to be stated but theres no sense in comparing this to minus one and that should not take away from either experienceim judging this movie based on the style they were aiming for though the showa era can span from somber to straight goofy we got the feeling they were going away from the somber end of things with this one me personally im still a much bigger fan of the  tone but thats not to say i cant enjoy myself hereall that being said we finally got some humanfree monster interaction and communication it works very well for me too i do like the humans as i think theyre the key to perspective in these movies i do think the humans need to tone down on the silliness a little bit though expect a joke attempt for most scenes containing themi liked how the humans integrated into the conflict here it was pretty interesting and especially hearing the story of the titans for what hasnt been explored in these movies yet i just think some of the scenes dont hit as hard as they should since i was basically waiting for a punchline i want humans i just want them done in a certain waythese monsters have way more personality in this one in gvk we had some mean mugging and attitude but here we have that and much more facial expression and emotion some of you may like it some of you may not i dont think theres any way to know other than seeing itthis story moves fast too fast that being said i get it theres also a ton of story to get through i couldve sat through another  minutes though honestly i wouldve taken an extra  minutes of fighting and  minutes of context i have no problem with long movies so thats just methe fights are what you come for this is no minus one and it doesnt need to be the movie has an infinity war feeling in my opinion at one point the gripe i have is some fights needed to be much longer i know godzilla is the king and i love watching him win but i still need to feel like its earned especially with the context in his part of the story there are some crazy sequences in this one and im glad they simply said were going this side of the showa era and we do not care that being said its not straight goofy but it is pretty creative and cool i think they adapted that era to the modern era perfectly as far as fighting goes i just needed them to last longer especially the final battle i guess its more of a  part final battle but that second part was much too quick for mestill if this sounds like what youre looking for go see it i even say this isnt my favorite but i had a hell of a time this movie is not designed to be analyzed critically it is to be injected into your veins as kaiju juice there are still some things holding it back from that type of movie being better but its still worth it in my opinion
sadly this has to come after minus one if not in itself it would have been quite a lo more entertainingpersonally i do not like the new choice of color for godzilla it brings no added benefit that is memorable and kinda looks metrosexualkongs power gauntlet is just too convenient to be ready for him makes little senseand mothra makes a surprise appearance or is that a mosquito with butterfly wings the team really needs to revise the look of mothraoverall the movie is entertaining enough but easily forgettable not as good as the previous installment and pales in comparison to the first
"im gonna be honest and just say its meh i still think that king of the monsters was the best of the  and after they introduced mechagodzilla in gvk everything went downhill in terms of plot is the movie wonderfully cinematically pleasing yes the visuals are stunning and the cgi just gets better as it goes but its hard to enjoy all that when the plot is so god awfulspoilers ahead
what part of telepathic people makes any sense in a monster vs monster movie and why can gia teleport everything about the iwi tribe in this movie made no sense to the whole plot and seemed pointlessly forcedand scar king was cool and all but he wasnt supposed to be the major threat shimu was supposed to be the big bad wolf and they spent a lot of time making it seem like she was a threat to global security given the fact she caused the ice age but then she ends up just teaming with zilla kong and mothra in the end and submits to kong as if shes not another alpha titan who would fight for dominancethe monsters in this movie compared to the other movies seem so weightless as if theyre not hundreds of thousands of pounds  foot tall killing machines and why are they so human like it just seems like a lot of the movie made no logical sense and youd expect that from a monster movie but its honestly just too muchoverall i still enjoyed the movie but its probably one i wouldnt watch several time just for fun with how pointless the plot felt"
this movie is awesome i went into it being dragged by my friend for his birthday as has become our tradition with this franchise i havent enjoyed a single movie in this franchise until now now let me get this out in the open this movie only works if you dont think about it i hate it when people say that and i never do but here i think its warrantedthe main characters are saying their guesses on the current situation that turn out to be the exact explanation constantly they basically just exist to explain the insane scififantasy thats happening hieroglyphics are interpreted not only in great detail but also without a single misread the robot hand they made for kong for some reason just happens to be stored in hollow earth for some reason right where they crashed for some reason and it has the medicine for frostbite in it for some reason etcbut thats not really what this movie is about is it look at the title and thats where this movie shines and delivers on their intent i want kong to have a robot hand i dont want him to lose his hand i want the plot to move along and for all these crazycool things to exist so who cares for whatever reason it works the bread and butter of this is great and thats all that matterthe dumb stuff wasnt even all that dumb i only rolled my eyes a few times and the rest was tolerable enough it really did feel like a kidspreteens movie or big budget b movie and theres nothing wrong with that because if you make a movie like this that knows what it is and tries to be nothing more thats just fine there is a bad way to do this and a right way this could have been much better of course and it could have been a lot worse but ill take it the little boy in me was satisfied and kids need movies like this i loved con air when i was a kid i dont now i didnt love the insider as a kid but i do nowthe monster stuff was well done and there was a lot of it i was actually surprised at how many scenes without dialogue there were and how well the story and characters came across i found myself hooked into all of the thrills and chills which made me think am i actually enjoying this the crazy world that they created with hollow earth and the ice lizard and all that mythology was very cool and reminded me of being a kid playing with my toys especially the scar king when that name was first said i was game his spine whip was very cool the creature designs was also very coolthey did very well at letting this be a monster movie normally its crammed with human stuff that you really just dont care about i think they finally figured out how to make an american monster movie dan stevens was really good i thought his character was going to be really annoying at first but hes a good actor and his naturalistic stuff was a good addition to the team and he did comedy very well he wasnt a badass but he knew what was going on a big laugh came out of me when kong laughed after knocking out the scar kings toothi kept thinking that this was the movie i wanted to see as a kid i loved godzilla and king kong as a kid maybe without ever actually seeing a movie about them i just loved the idea the only movies i had growing up in the s were the originals which were boring for a little kid great now and the japanese movies which were either too cheesy or hard to find so im glad that kids from now on will have this to satisfy their love of monsters
first of all dont readlisten to all those reviewers who have no idea about how the monsterverse works especially the ones who compare gxk with minus one they both are movies made for their own monsterverses pov respectively those who still choose to compare them have no understanding about the word povheres the real review for all the monster lovers out there yes adam wingard has definitely listened to all us monster lovers and has made what we asked more of monstrous action offcourse no movie plot revolving around planet earth can ever be made with  humans involvement unless its a jurassic era documentary so we do get a small boring human plotthe move is filled with monster action sequences which are epic but some scenes did lack originality like controlling shimo by a small piece of crystal which just automatically glows without any onoff button or some hypnotic effects only when pointed at her cgi at various points are quite messed up but afterall weve got what we wantedthe human plot was just stinky some parts were actually essential but the rest just a bunch of meaningless  ironic plot filling crap i mean what was all that iwi technology crystal pyramids anti gravity etc etc bs a titan vet as a full time profession seriously apart from kong which other titan is gonna examine  take care of rest of them will straight away be ready to gulp him up they had a metallic arm support which is readily available in the hollow earth just in time its like as if they knew kongs gonna get only his arm right arm injured cringe alertadam did try to add more of some comedic plot compared to gvk some people did buy it but like i said earlier its just a meaningless plot filling crapregarding the cast performance kaylee hottle just had  worried face expression through out the movie the rest of the cast did try to give their best in whatever screen time they hadoverall its a great  money worthy popcorn flick satisfying the fans monster brawling needs but with a cringey human plot
this is the right time where hollywood should stop making these godzilla and apes movies atleast for a decadeso in this movie godzilla decided to light itself with pink lights and fight against a godzilla like creature with white lights and freezing properties then there are apes wakanda people inside hollow earth with great cg technologies and do nothing seems this movie aint made for watching but to put cool lights on silver screenwe have few human characters as well protagonist wisdom girl cool white guy compulsory funny black guy and one guy supposed to die about which no body cares so all these characters go on a simple mission which turns out to be existential threat to earth so these people watch a bunch of monsters fight until credits roll
its exactly what you want in a movie with godzilla and kong the story is so so but the action and the visuals are incredible not to mention the sound design is top notch too these are the movies that are made to be seen on the big screen with friends if having fun at the movies isnt for you then whats the point the villains and other monsters are a nice addition and even a surprise appearance from someone with definitely make godzilla fans smile hopefully this has a sequel because who doesnt want to keep watching these titans fight it out wwe style go see it on the biggest loudest screen you can
taking place after the events of godzilla vs kong kong settles into his new home in the hollow earth during his stay he encounters more of his kind including a small red ape who starts out as hostile but begins to trust kong however with this discovery comes a new threat skar king a tyrannical leader of apes who controls a titan with ice powers kong must get the help of his rival godzilla in order to take on skar king and his weapon kong is accompanied by dr irene andrews and her adoptive daughter jia who is close to kong bernie hayes the conspiracy podcaster and newcomer trapper who helped heal one of kongs woundsgodzilla x kong the new empire delivers exactly on what the trailers promised i have heard that this movie puts the human characters to the side a bit and gives more spotlight to the monsters while i think the humans got a little more screen time than i thought they would have this movie definitely focuses on kong and the civilization of apes he discovers this movie is kongs story and what i like a lot about this movie is how his scenes are handled with his expressions and actions the relationship between kong and suko is the perfect example we can see when suko slowly begins to trust kong as he shows the young ape kindness just from his eyes these scenes do a great job with show and do not tell this is definitely where director adam wingards passion for the source material comes into play i can tell that wingard set out to make a movie about the titans rather than the humans dealing with the titans i really enjoyed the scenes where kong is traveling through hollow earth and discovering the other apes they are interesting intense and fun especially the scenes with kong and sukoskar king might be my favorite villain from the monsterverse he has the most ominous presence i have seen from a villain in a while just the way he walks around his army how he smirks at kong the way he controls shimo and how he uses his awesome weapon makes him such a memorable bad guy shimo is pretty fun but a bit more of a minion than i thought she would be my only major complaint about this movie is that i really wish godzilla got a little more screentime i understand that this kongs movie and that godzilla is more of a force of nature than a character but i would have loved to see him either destroying more monsters or spending a little more time fighting alongside kongthe action scenes are fantastic this is a movie that is packed with action from nearly beginning to end my favorite set piece is one that takes place in hollow earth that involves zero gravity it is one thing to have kaijus battle it out but it is another to have them fight from rocktorock that whole fight is a joy to watch and it reminds me why i love seeing these kinds of films on the big screen another fight i like is kongs first encounter with suko and two other apes yes it looks a bit goofy but it is so entertaining to watch kong use suko as a weapon to smack the hostile apes all of the fights are enjoyable to watch because they are shot expertly and they pack a punchwhile i prefer the visual style of kong skull island and gvk to this this movie is not without striking images and creative set designs i love the use of purple in this movie particularly with godzilla he looks more powerful than ever some of the sets on hollow earth look really cool especially the temple which fits hollow earth well the special effects for the monsters look amazing as they are so expressive and lively that it gives them more character their powers look great and their designs are very impressive the scale is interesting here because the monsters are now in a world bigger than earth making them seem a bit smaller than they are i love the scene where they return to earth to remind us their massive size this is a great looking movie that shows how much fun adam wingard had directing this movie between the colorful visuals and the crazy fight scenes the soundtrack is decent with a nice choice of song at the end and a solid musical score by tom holkenborg and antonio di lorioi think the human story is okay but not particularly inspired the cast do a great job especially kaylee hottle as jia who is wonderful in this movie hottle is a deaf actress and she does a fantastic job expressing herself especially with her interactions with kong and with her adoptive mother she is the heart and soul to both this and gvk brian tyree henry and dan stevens look like they are having the time of their lives here and rebecca hall gives a very committed performance as dr irene andrews the actors are definitely game and they are fun to watch my problem is that they are kind of just here along with kong for the ride jia is the only character who has a major role in the storythe tone of the movie is very goofy with plenty humor that mostly landed with me and a lot of scenes that make little sense there is a scene where one of the humans gets eaten by a plant out of nowhere and it is not brought up again after that scene this feels like watching a saturday morning cartoon more than any of the other monsterverse films it works for this film because of all of the monsterverse movies it has the most absurd story this is an adventure into a brand new world that comes up with an excuse to bring kong and godzilla on the same side this is a movie that knows what it is and it does not hold back on the cheesy plot and the bombastic action scenesi have a lot more to say about godzilla x kong the new empire however i would have to get into spoilers at that point so i will just say this i had a great time with godzilla x kong i got exactly what i wanted from the movie this movie has some amazing action scenes and goofy moments that make it more enjoyable to watch but it also has a lot of heart this is a movie where i can tell that every person involved in the production had a blast making this movie now i am excited to see what new direction the monsterverse will take after this
what does the x in the title mean godzilla multiplied by kong or godzillas ex kong which one is it so there is earth beneath surface how the heck does it get sun to have all that vegetation and look as bright as amazons jungles is there another sun inside the earth for the hallow earth trust me i put my logical brain utterly in coma to be able to watch this movie but it was still too dumb of a movie the acting dialogue everything else is just as bad almost everyone is either angry or agitated and awaiting dooms day even when nothing has happened yet jokes are flat and out of place it feels like the early generation of ai has written this movie for a bored wanker with monster fetish
its disheartening that perpetual dissatisfaction and biased reviews are prevalent in the industry its great that you found kong to be the best addition appreciating kongs leadership and the entertainment value each film has its own storyline and merits making direct comparisons less meaningful this installment seems to stand out offering a fresh perspective and an enjoyable experiencesome folks are never happy and some critics might get paid to write bad stuff but its awesome you think kong rocks kongs a cool leader and the movies super fun dont compare it to godzilla minus one because theyre different stories each film is unique and kong stands out for its fresh take and fun vibe
as far as im concerned the original could have used less human story and just stuck with godzilla and kong going at it ive said it out loud once and it feels like they heard me though the new empire does have a human story it goes by so quick as to not let too much time linger between the kong godzilla scenes it threw me off at first cause i was not expecting such a short movie but it was jampacked with all the monster fighting you needed particularly with kong being a bigger focus on this movie than the other so much so in fact that you could say that he was that human story i was expecting in the film the destruction was wicked no matter what godzillas duty to protect this earth in the monsterverse being created this movie makes it obvious that we are nothing but insects to this dude there was something truly horrifying about the death and destruction that this movie was showing i dont think any godzilla movie was as globe trodding as the new empire allowing the king of monsters to commit to some serious genocide defending the planet as a whole its a little disturbing and i loved it but its the only thing this movie shares with the far betterdone godzilla minus oneoverall its the perfect movie experience
the tagline which was one reserved for bollywood movies has to be unfortunately used for hollywood moviesthe cgi in the movie was so bad that none of the scenes seemed believable and creature who both godzilla and kong fight together seems to have been left half bakedmay be the creators decided to make godzilla movie with healthy mix of avatar wakanda ironman and a lot of other superhero movies but didnt spent anytime in developing the script sets or the cgithe movie seems to tick all the checkboxes in terms of die we have a teenage lead who is mute and shown to be from some ancient tribe who is supposed to be chosen to help win this war appropriately called wisdom girl in one of the reviews has only one expression of inquisitiveness throughout the movie never being able to quite justify why she was the chosen on to complete the ensemble we have female lead a pilot who is killed off immediately to show his arrogance and high handedness a sort of youtuber and a vet if only hollywood concentrated on character building and storylines then solely focusing on diversity angle while making the moviein this movie we explore the hollow earth which is supposed to be a world of its own deep beneath the surface of the earth while the concept sounds exciting as some scriptures also mention existence of such world in the movie hollow earth is another name for pandora or rather poorly rendered pandora despite being deep inside earth surface the creatures the habitat even trees and waterfalls grow the same way as they would on surface of earth exposed to all the sunlight at one moment we see some sort of bright disc like sun without any explainationmight be the creators themselves realized the mess they have created so they decided to start he trailer with clips of the movie prequel which is never a good sign to overcompensate there is a saturation of chest thumping and shaking noises throughout the fight scenesmay be children might find this movie fascinating because of colors and concept of hollow earth but there doesnt seem to be any other redeeming factor in the movie
primitive  brainless  pointless basically less of everything  nevertheless  gets  stars from me  for a sheer non stop absurd over the top action  which managed to captivate and thrill personally i dislike all of this new films  which put of all of the known big dudesmonsterstitans in one big mashup couse it feels that all of them missing a lot of themselves by sharing screen time with othersprefer more old fashioned  classical films so considering all of the many negative feelings i had towards this film even before it came out  its wonderful that it gave me a pleasant surprise  overall  decent one time watch
godzillas reduction to almost a cameo in this one notwithstanding he needs to start being truly scary going ape full pun intended in hong kong on his previous outing was a step in the right direction hes no longer seen as the allbenevolent protector of mankind and hes more than happy to demonstrate that hell gladly splat humans in planes and warships like bugs if it suits his purposeswhen you imagine giant monsters stomping across the landscape you dont picture overly irritating sidekick characters dropping unfunny oneliners and cracking unfunny jokes enough with the tiresome comic relief trope no more bernie no more trapper no more obese madison sidekickive had my fair share of kaiju dreams and i remember all of them being scary as hell id wake up with my heart pounding away like a piston there was nothing remotely funny about them what they were terrifyingly awesome and i loved every second of themboring family subplot  dense dialogue aside godzilla minus one knew the score they are not cute plushies that you cuddle with in bed they are monsters they need to start looking and playing the part
this movie is good but not great this movie is mainly about kong and his journey in hollow earth with the humans trying to help him godzilla is sidelined and he doesnt do anything except chill on the surface until the end this is one of the dumbest movies like when kong goes to the dentist and gets a gauntlet because he has frostbite the human characters are better than the other movies in the franchise because theyre funnier but it started getting weirder and weirder what they do the villain was ok but he had no emotion to him and had no ark but he was cool with his bone wip the action and cgi was really good and carried the movie it was generic and did nothing new so ill give it a  out of 
"what a waste of time totally a brainless movie which made no sense whatsoever i think the worst ever movie i saw of godzilla or kong whether at individual level combined totally ruined i dont think i will be watching any more godzilla or kong movie as this movie made a damage to the image and reputation i had for such movies normally i dont write a review but wanted to add for this one so that people could get an opportunity to deprive themselves of the trauma lol
i waited patiently for  hours and  mins thinking something would come up that would make sense or some action but it ended  hours  mins of non stop nonsense"
this was a good movie to watch alot of titans fighting with the monsters and there is alot of lore in this movie and godzilla vs shimo was a good watching and this was a masterpeace of the movie franchise and i will watch it again when it comes to streaming platforms and i will buy some merch too this how good this movie was and next kong fight was cool and i really enjoyed a  fight and the cast was amazing in this movie and the godzila transformation is actually amazing and kong new armor hand was actual amazing and this movie is a amazing movie and i think you should watch it and tell me how you like it
godzilla is on the surface battling various monsters king kong is now in hollow earth and he has a toothache there is relative peace as long as the two are separated something is rising from deeper below ilene andrews rebecca hall bernie hayes brian tyree henry trapper dan stevens and jia kaylee hottle last survivor of the iwi tribe from skull island all travel to hollow earththis franchise is going all in on monarch hollow earth and all that previously i looked at hollow earth sideeyed at this point i actually appreciate the ridiculousness it could have gone much wackier especially with jia i almost want to see that at some point i just relax and enjoy the ride its some ride the mega destruction is pretty cool im guessing that every movie will be destroying a few global cities the humans are silly meaningless banter and techno gibberish on the other hand i dont mind the planet of the apes at all
i watched godzilla vs kong a day before watching this and man what a movie it was but this one doesnt even come halfway as good as that the plot was horrible it felt like the writers werent even trying to make a good plot the action scenes are a total dissapointment and godzilla was not used to its true potential this was definitely the worst movie ive seen in a whilei am still giving this a  because i liked the journey of kong through the hollow earth and his fight with skarking but everything else was terrible to say the least the stakes were lacking and the cgi was midoverall a total waste of money better go see dune part  if you havent
"the legendary pictures do realy well at that movie they finally found the balance between how much human and how much monster scene we need the only thing that makes me not give  stars is that there were not enough godzilla scenes for me we only really see godzilla at the beginning of the film and in the final boss fight the film was mainly about kong and the hollow earthbut the visuals and effects themselves were very good the fights were of sufficient length for such a filmso i liked it yes
theres a post credit scene no sadly we waited  minutes to see it but nothing comes
this is my personal opinion on godzilla x kong the new empire"
this film starts off by showing how kong is adapting to living in middle earth how people are watching kong to make sure hes ok and also how they are watching godzilla to make hes keeping humans safe by fighting monsters whilst watching kong a strange signal comes from middle earth and a team of people decide to go down and see whats causing this signal and they find out that the signal is a distress signal but what is calling for help and why are they calling for helpwhilst the team of people is exploring middle earth to find out what this signal is the world looks amazing especially in d and there are some fight scenes between kong and other monsters and we also see glimpses of godzilla fighting monsters as well but i felt like some of these fights were cut shortone of the humans thats exploring middle earth is called trapper dan stevens and the jokes he cracks are good trapper is also a vet who helps kong with his arm after it gets injured in a fight with a monster and he helps by giving him this robotic arm again gadgets like these are something i would have liked to have seen more ofeven though i thought some of the fight scenes were cut short i did enjoy the monster battle at the end but one of the monsters in this final fight is mothra and i would have liked to have seen her do more overall though i had a good time watching this film and im looking forward to the next film in this series
horrible piece of basic mash of poo seriously who are the people who sign off scripts who from the stupio was like hmm yes the script seem to be written by a  years old child and the direct already botched a few movies lets give him millions of dollars to waste againawful story basic d characters plot is loose like kongs diarrhea it feels like an insult to audiences intelligencelazy writing lazy talentless directing why anyone hires this dude bribing networkingshout to the animators visuals are pretty good sadly even the decent animations cant save this movegod awful dont watch it dont waste your money and time
"this film was a solid  out of  for me i actually found myself enjoying it more then godzilla vs kongthe good
king kong was awesome this might be my favorite portrayal of kong on the big screen ive never thought him interesting but he actually was awesome in this filmthe human characters were on screen just long enough to care about but short enough not to get annoyed by them in godzilla vs kong the human characters scenes went on for way to longthe giant monsters were actually pretty funny at one point king throws a rock at a monster that is trying to runaway also godzilla takes a nap if a pretty iconic locationthe bad
didnt really feel like the giant monsters were a real threat especially once the inevitable team up between the two title characters happenedoverall the film was solid and works best on a big movie theatre screen overall it was better then transformers   pacific rim uprising godzilla vs kong i would say it aligns with my score for transformers rise of the beast and pacific rim"
"visuals 
story 
storytelling 
action 
humour overall beautifully crafted scenes that immerse the viewer in the wonderful world of hollow earth and its multiple denizens their facial expressions are impressivethe storytelling seems to take precedence over the action with people talking alot about what is going on and who is doing what but there is alot to tell or else it would be confusing in basically an alien landscapethe action is decent but feels a little subdued were the producers keeping to a time limit perhaps i think if they had put extra effort into the fighting it may have gone three hours i think they found the right balancethe silly humour lost me a little it almost felt michael bayish hopefully they do not intend on going this way i like more dark humour and action in this kind of film especially in the earlier movies they were alot darker this one seemed a bit too bright and cheeryotherwise a good outing too bad i left it so long until the final screenings to see"
overall the movie is great when it comes to the kaiju scenes the major problem is when it comes to the humans unlike past installments where the films are  serious this film starts to slide into jurassic world and mcu territory becoming more comedy they introduce a wannabe chris pratttype character named trapper to be an unnecessary future sequel love interest for female character ilene andrews his biggest negative is that he gives the movie a cheap excuse to force in classic rock music into scenes where they dont belong nobody wants to hear kiss play i was made for lovin you during a kaiju battle get that crap outta here i had to remove  star because of this and there being no godzilla theme
this american made godzilla flick is another example as to why we always prefer and consider the original toho godzilla flicks as the better oneswhile the latest minus one film was a great film taking the monster seriously with a great scenario presenting godzilla as a serious menace tro humanity this new american take on the monsters presents great cgi monster fights and nothing elseno character developments no serious scenario indefferent acting and a failure everywhere except the cgi monster battlesunfortunately almost all of the recent american godzilla king kong remake films are based only in the monster fights excluding maybe only the first  godzilla american solo film which tried to be smg different up to a levelanyhow u can watch minus one and then watch this film and see how much better is the minus one toho filmthats why the real godzilla is only the original toho godzilla franchise and not these cash in american godzilla remakes which are only for people who want to see the new cgi effects and dont care about taking the monsters seriouslythere were parts of the movie so ridiculous that u say wtf is going on here since when kong goes to the dentist  there were parts of the movie that they made it a comedy that is not good this is a godzilla and kong film its not a crap dc pase iv universe movie to make fun withthe best part of the movie was the final battle but a large portion of the film was boring at least they could include more monsters but they were more about apes this was more a kong movie and godzilla was a guest star or something they even presented mothra in a different way like we used to know her from the toho films and where was rodan so i give this a c and that only for the great indeed cgi battle effects
godzilla x kong is an pure storytelling movie director adam wingard understands the assignment for this movie the action the colors the score its everything i wanted from a monsterverse film the cast is amazing dan stevensbrian tyree henry and kaylee hottle are the best characters the cinematography is great epic monsters battle is great kong and suko are the heart of this movie the scale is epic this is nonverbal story of the monsters the monsters treated as characters with respect and honor this is a love letter to the showa godzilla movies godzilla has some cool moments in this movie people needs to watch this movie on imax for the art of cinemas i hope the future of the monsterverse to be continue i loved it very much
"this could have been best monsterverse movie of the franchisescreentime of humans need to reduced next time it was too much in this movie and it could have been much better if skar was shown in first  minutes of the movie by telling his origins why he became evil how he got crystal  he shouldnt have been killed he would have come back in next movie for a revengei have deducted  stars for not giving enough screen time for our titans  movie running on fast pace and main villain was underutilized pardon me if i have missed something
this is my first review for any movieshowthanks for reading 😊"
cant believe we went from gareth edwards semiplausible  godzilla film to this garbagethis is a movie for kids that looks like it was made by kids every scene cuts within  seconds even if it doesnt require it just to try and hold attention every meaningless plot point is summarized by a zany side character for easy comprehension and worst of all  they personified all the monsters to make them relatablewhat was previously the only redeeming feature of the sequels gaint monster fights has been ruined in the last two films by basically making kong a human hes not a giant wild ape any more he makes traps he slings his axe over his shoulder and he takes a shower like hes had a bad day at the office you know youve reached the bottom of the barrel when youre only way to get an audience to side with your monster protagonist is to make him all but humanhillbilly kong x misunderstood ice godzilla x transformer kong x purple godzilla x giant ewok is the probably the dumbest film ive seen in the last five years far from being entertaining i absolutely hated it on every level and it left me feeling angry that they found a way to ruin the entire franchise
looooove the new monsters special monster appearance no spoilers here baby kong great throwback feel with the soundtrack and spectacular visuals wild battles audience applause cheering what else do you wanna see on the big screen better visuals than gvk would love just a little more godzilla but when hes there its awesome and whatever its a blastthe monsters are great as more developed characters but without losing any of their monstrousness the critics seem to miss this fact and are focused on the human characters no acknowledgment of depth of monster characters umm this is a godzilla movie name one from the old school where you remember more than one of the human characters
im a recent fan of the monsterverse and binged them all with my best friend they are easy films to follow with amazing affects and are very funny so i expected the same with g x k we excitedly ran to our local cinema to watch it and were blown awaythe story is so nonsensical and dumb that it was hilarious to follow the cgi was incredible despite having the lowest budget of any of these films for whatever reason i honestly forgot cgi could be good due to marvel constantly shoving bad effects down my throatthe human cast while still not great were much better than last time my only real complaint is that godzilla is once again shafted hard in this film despite his name being the first word in the title it isnt as bad as g vs k where he only appeared twice an hour apart from each other thoughthe battles were amazing and very well choreographed which made for a insane final actif you like fun movies id watch this with a friendi give godzilla x kong the new empire a  out of 
the casting is abysmal the lead actress has no screen presence the military guy is fat with all the military clichesa life threatening monster has been discovered and the governments are letting a private company handle this with no fail safe options no presence of military this movie just made me shut my eyeskong is running from wolves when he can simply climb a ledge i mean the plot holes are as big as a cratera life threatening monster has been discovered and the governments are letting a private company handle this with no fail safe options no presence of military this movie just made me shut my eyeskong is running from wolves when he can simply climb a ledge i mean the plot holes are as big as a craterdefinitely not worth your time
i was initially disappointed with scar kings limited screen time and lack of menace in the movie it frustrated me how the focus seemed to shift away from the main monsters to human characters particularly the deaf girl with visionary abilities making it unclear what the movies central theme was supposed to be however i did appreciate the impressive action sequences and visual effects kongs character development was a highlight with the story revolving around him tracker stood out as a welldeveloped human character who supported kongs journey despite these positives the movies mediocrity can be attributed to the insufficient spotlight on the villains which falls on the studios and writers
i watched this movie in cinema today all alone and by myself its an action adventure movie with as one would expect not much sophistication or twist on the story front it manages to be interesting enough throughout though and its simplicity is never silly nor is its unfolding overly predictable the visuals are the main strong point of the movie with kongs ever existing hybrid charisma also lefting things up and introducing hero dimension into the mix i felt some of the monsters were not as exciting as i wouldve hoped for them to be respect king ghidorah and neither were many of the characters involved in this adventure one thing id like to point out here is that i felt watching this movie in d did harm to the experience as i strongly felt that that kind of visuals needs to be watched in d in order to do it justice i dont even know if it does play in d but if it does then go for the d version a good watch overall i give it 
good movie enjoyed it went to see it at the imax cinema and it was everything i expected it was very loud with a lot of fight scenes between kong and other titans he sees throughout the movie the colour palette was very good vibrant and gave it a retro action movie style to it jokes landed well cgi was on point and really good fight scenes were amazing especially on a large screen like an imax very good would recommended it for fans of the previous movies the back storey elements were good and gave it a unique feel to the rest of the king kong  godzilla films it was more thoughtful and had a good story line so wasnt just an endless stream of violence with no real story to it very good well done to the director and the cast
"went to watch this with my  sons and very low expectationsmy expectations werent low enough terrible acting ridiculous plot that they seem to be making up as they filmedcgi of monsters and carnage thats been done a thousand times before and a tribe that communicate by thought and i know what they were thinkingget me out of this terrible film
i was hoping for a bit of entertaining popcorn movie fun but came away wishing id kept my dental appointment insteadreviewers on here giving scores of  out of  these people need their heads examining surely s out of  means a great filmthe fact that there were only about  people in the cinema on a school holiday should have given me a heads up as to how bad it was going to beharsh lesson learned"
godzilla x kong is a triumphantly epic film blending epic action with moments of genuine heart and a touch of absurdity surprisingly despite its simple and somewhat silly storyline it manages to captivate the human characters take a backseat allowing the titans to shine as the true stars while the plot may not be groundbreaking its exactly whats needed for an enjoyable action flick it doesnt aim to be complex like dune instead it offers pure entertainment the story though straightforward and silly at times isnt terribleits simple and serves its purpose well while the cgi was good for the most part there were some corny moments the music was good but i felt disappointed that they didnt use the original themes for the titans
"in a generation filled with superhero movies we take a side trip with this another monsterverse installment featuring big monsters which typically are also acting as heroesas distress calls the likes of kong and godzilla must join forces to stop scar king and his pet shimo from their own world to the country of brazil the great battle took place in the end brazil was saved but lots of innocent people died and their city destroyedlesser human screen time in this film is a good decision but perhaps a bit more focus on the monsters good luck with the cgi budget however the story is still good not that an amazing film overall but a film packed with action sequences and more more meow i mean roarsa good popcorn movie a good movie in the big screen a good action packed moviegodzilla x kong the new empire is a  for me
ps i love godzillas new rome i mean homegodzillaxkongthenewempire movies filmreview"
bland  pointless storyover acting for kong godzilla creatures they are creatures not humanunnecessary dialogueover used cgi very unnaturalsimply put this movie shouldnt even exist the directing of this movie is just pointless my brain felt dead after watching it better off watching godzilla minus one story and intention was very clear and plot kept you guessing compared to this one there is no motive what so ever everyone just appeared out of nowheresomehow this movie really needs to be reviewed by movie company before airing wish i could request refund for this time wasting movie
godzilla x kong the new empire is the best monsterverse movie yet it is the most enjoyable film of the year it has great groundbreaking visual effects the cinematography is great the writing is good the epic monsters battles are great and awesome the humans characters are good dan stevenss character is the best and brian tyree henrys character is good it is an amazing pure storytelling this is an art of cinemas family and friends will enjoy the movie very much as i do people needs to watch this epic on the biggest screen possible as well as in imax congrats on adam wingard and legendary pictures long live the monsterverse
in the history of cinema there has been some fantastic performer pairingskatherine hepburn and spencer tracy bob hope and bing crosby paul newman and robert redford gene wilder and richard pryor will smith and martin lawrence will ferrell and john c reilly and of course the greatest pairing of them all  kermit the frog and miss piggyadd to that list king kong and godzillain godzilla x kong the new empire the th in the monarch series of godzillakong films  and a direct sequel to s godzilla vs kong  director adam wingard has crafted a unique adventure for these two behemoths of the big screen  he put them in a buddy cop moviekong of course is the freewheeling funloving jokester who just wants to hang out with his buds while godzilla is the uptight serious older behemoth who is getting too old for this stuff and just wants to take a napcan these two put their differences aside and team up to defeat a new enemy that is stronger than each of them individually  but might not be if they join togetherwe all know what the answer to that question is and surprisingly this film is a pretty fun way to go about that journey in a cgifest monster punching monster live action cartoonand thats what this film is its like a saturday morning cartoon where the action is incredibly unbelievable but still a bunch of fun to watchohand theres humans around rebecca hall and brian tyree henry from the first film who stand around spouting mostly dialogue that is intended to clarify the plot points  and the stakes gotta give those  credit they deliver those lines like real pros never once winking at the camera as they say things such as kong cant stop this on his own and the reply he wont be alone its outrageousand funadding to the fun is dan stevens who is overacting to the perfect level he knows exactly what type of movie he is in and what his role is  and he does it wellwhile this godzilla film wont win any oscars like godzilla minus one  no relation to this film  did it still is a very entertaining way to a few hours in the theater munching on popcornanddoesnt that count for somethingletter grade b the very definition of a b picture stars out of  and you can take that to the bankofmarquis
worst plot and casting weak cgi hollywood must think cinema goers are stupid beside the main actress none of the other actors were likable nor had screen presenceonly redeeming  minute is when skar king laughs at kong for having a silver false toothnot worth the wait for dvd nor streaminganything scientific is totally suspended with no logical explanation this might as well be a fairytale this is not scifyonly redeeming  minute is when skar king laughs at kong for having a silver false toothi went to see ghostbusters but there was no late show so ended up watching this garbage waste of money and time
kong has a toothache and godzilla goes sightseeing in romethe thing about this film is that there is previous continuity you need to know the corporation monarch monitors titans  huge potentially and often actually destructive monsters godzilla and kong both work against titans but they hate each other so godzilla lives on earths surface while kong lives in hollow earth dont ask watch the previous filmthings follow on from the setup established in previous continuity and you might be a bit lost in places if you dont know about monarch hollow earth and the godzillakong grudgefesthaving said that this is a nonstop special effects extravaganza monsters kick the manure out of each other pretty much from start to finish with a little bit of human interest every now and then to keep us invested if you want eye candy this film has it in industrial quantitiesbut this is basically a b feature with a huge budget
ill just start by saying that if you know what to expect from a movie like this and you still want to see it then i cant recommend it enough godzilla x kong the new empire is now in theatres and its probably the most fun bombastic silly as well as dumb movie in this whole monsterverse to date when this franchise began in  with godzilla and then kong skull island shortly after i never expected we would end up with a movie like this one look this movie was made for people who want to see giant monsters fight each other so if thats all you need from this it delivers heres why this big dumb movie gave me an awesome experiencepicking up after the events of godzilla vs kong the majority of this movie takes place down in hollow earth still unravelling secrets about skull island a group of new and old cast members journey into the depths of hollow earth making discoveries about ancestors and possible current civilization this continues throughout the movie as kong discovers a leader of apes scar king this leads to kong needing the help of godzilla who has spent the entire movie charging up at random nuclear locations around the world yes the overall plot is that silly and all over the place but it all builds up to a minute battle sequence that was just pure funi will say as expected the human story is thin but i really didnt care and thats because of dan stevens performance he knew the movie he was in and he was just having a blast with his character he livened up the movie when the monsters werent there which is also not very often this time around a nice story continues from the previous instalment about ilene rebecca hall and her newfound daughter jia kaylee hottle but kong with a giant robotic glove godzilla being the most powerful he has ever been zero gravity action scenes and surprise monsters all clashing together just made me smile if youre looking for something deep look elsewheregodzilla x kong the new empire may have been exactly the movie i was searching for at the time but i cant deny that it worked for me the movies premise is honestly just a bunch of nonsense to build up to awesome action and that was clearly director adam wingards plan from the beginning this is a movie built specifically for fans of giant monsters and for that i have to give it up for it delivering that will there be a dumber bigbudget movie this year probably not but this is an example of dumb done amazingly well if this review sells you on seeing it then i absolutely recommend it
huge monsters duking it out pyramids changing gravity nonsensical plot and fun special effects there is nothing plausible or anything that makes sense in any way what you will get is a fun monster movie people who go to these films expecting citizen kane are the more ridiculous reviewers this is a movie you go in with some soda and popcorn and just relax to this movie exists to entertain you so let it the monster fights and effects are superb and that is all you need the human characters simply subsist in the midst of the story godzilla x kong is great fun so what are you waiting for we dont just go to the movies for oscar powerhouses we go to have a good time in that this movie is what the doctor ordered
the plot to kong godzilla new empire is that below the earth are face painted tribal people who use crystals to control gravity and who are a looking for a psychic deaf girl because they need her to awaken a mother moth that shoots magical spider webs in order to unite old man king kong his minime and nuclear godzilla to stop a big red monkey with a bone bullwhip and an ice breathing lizard dogit would have been better if this plot had been all monster and no humans but like the rest of this universe its mostly humans who are dumb and unlikeable and stupid and in this one the humans are the most dumb and unlikeable and stupid than any of the previous filmsall four prior films had some charm this one lacks its super dumb and not worth seeing in theaters just stay home and dont watch
"godzilla x kong the th film in monsterverse is nothing new in terms of story but it will give you an amazing experience in theatre especially if you are seeing it in imax d there are many great eye popping visuals epic destructice action scenes and crazy monsters running throughout screen which will keep you entertained for nearly two hours storywise its nothing new like every other movie godzilla awakes attacks somewhere which lead him to another monster they fight and godzilla wins the end meanwhile some human scientists will do crazy things throughout the movie i mean cmon isnt it what all monsterverse movies arebut some things are meant to be enjoyed without paying too much attention to the story and turn off you brain to enjoy the ride this franchise is all about this concept youll get some epic action scenes buildings crumblings to dust monsters clashing and some drama i mean what else can you expect from a franchise about monsters lol
these types of movies are meant to be enjoyed in theatres without using any brain just to get awesome big screen and sound experienceif you have kids take them out to see this movie theyll love it and maybe you too"
godzilla x kong  is a movie that grabs the attention of action fans with its stunning visuals and epic showdowns between giant creatures the visual effects are mindblowing especially in how they portray the battles and the aftermath of destruction caused by these titans while the film doesnt aim to break new ground it does provide an experience that allows viewers to switch off their brains for two hours which can be a plus for those just looking to be entertainedhowever it falls short in delivering emotional depth or a gripping storyline unlike the japanese film godzilla minus one the human characters are onedimensional and easily forgettable failing to leave a lasting impression on the audience the villain is also weak and lacking in menace missing the qualities needed to stand out as a true antagonist in summary godzilla x kong  is a visual spectacle that while offering momentary fun lacks memorability and fails to evoke a lasting emotional impact
kong enters our world because he has a rotten painful tooth giant heli brings a metal tooth to replace it in one minute surgeru like that take weeks in real worldat this point i expected godzilla to replace its tale with a broomstick laughable in most terrible waythe reptile goes to recharge by killing tiamat with no problem doing thatunderneath a tribe of kong like giant apes we found out are always trying to conquer the surface and bring an ice age with the use of a cold elemental monster imprisoned by the leader of the apesmothra appears out of nowhere and with g and k go underneath and battle the enemies mentioned than resurface and defeat thema girl has a shoelace tied around her head and to make her look for us as a native american indian last survivor of a tribefull of cliches and simple action done using cgi the movie maybe entertaining for kids and teens barrelya fail and a painful experience that laft me scarred for life  kidding but seriously the movie is lazy bad
was my first time seeing  rpx movies in the same day cause i saw ghostbusters frozen empire a couple hours before which was great too and i absolutely love how in godzilla x kong the new empire had a lot more to do with the creatures i didnt see minus one cause i dont do well with subtitles i throughly enjoy these ones they deserve to be praised i very much enjoy adam wingard films especially youre next the guest blair witch remake was better than original and the previous godzilla vs kong was great too i love that dan stevens was a big part of this he starred in the guest and enjoyable in anything i hope plenty appreciate this film it deserves itedit i got to re watch in imax made me appreciate the movie even more i love sounds and im glad ive seen the last few godzilla x kong vs ones in imax
godzilla x kong was an entertaining movie with enough monster fights to keep you engaged the story is rough even by monsterverse standards though brian tyree henry and dan stevens are great as comedic relief but the rest of the humanpart of the story really struggled to find its roots the writers made it too humancentric at times which is not the reason were seeing the film some plot points youre supposed to just glaze over and pretend that its okay which is fine for this universe but they did it a bit too much here its saved by comedic lines and the fact that it never takes itself seriously still doesnt live up to the standards of the first godzilla movie from 
action sequences are good and some human characters are actually funnythis shouldnt be called godzilla x kong this is a kong movie godzilla is a side quest in this movie the villains in this movie didnt pose a real threat both very mid and the script for this movie was all over the place no steadiness about it all im going to say is at the end of this movie you can tell this franchise is going to become very far fetched more than it already is wasnt on the edge of my seat through all hr min and was very disappointing too much hype around the movie wasnt bad but wasnt good  for this one
godzilla x kong is the latest film in the monster verse its weird to get two movies involving godzilla coming out within several months of each other on completely sperate ends of the spectrum you had minus one which is a serious war drama about a man seeking redemption this film is an overthetop dumb fun monster movie i know many people have put this film down for being not like minus one however it never set out to be i have always believed that a movie should be judged on whether it succeeds at what it sets out to do this film sets out to be an entertaining monster fighting movie does it succeed in that more or lessthis film like all the others is breathtaking visually the monster fights are good this movie does deliver on the dumb action beats when the movie focuses only on the monsters fighting or interacting its at its best i just wish scar came off as more of a threat than he was while the fights are still entertaining to watch you never get the sense that godzilla or kong are in any real serious danger like in past films while i like the human characters more here than in the last two films they still arent that interesting and bog the movie down by focusing on them so muchthats the main flaw with all these films aside from skull island like the transformers movies the writers andor producers of these film think the audience needs the human characters to grasp whats going on and to have an emotional tether to the film but they dont do that good of a job at making us care about most of them the best character in these movies by leaps and bounds has been kong if they ever make any more of these films they should set the next one in the distant past and have no humans at all thatd be differentmy favorite movies of the monster verse are kong skull island and godzilla vs kong i would put this film just below godzilla vs kong if youre a fan of those two films you should enjoy this alright i enjoy this more than both the godzilla movies in this line i did enjoy myself in the theater for the most part godzilla x kong is dumb fun and theres nothing wrong with that but if want something on the level of minus one or even godzilla  youre not going to get anything out of this
its just one of those big budget movies that you go in for pure enjoyment and are just brainless fun with no specific story to be told but lore to figure out and have in mind when it comes to the kaijus monsters and the world excluding the humans from iti dont mind the amount of human interaction that was there but the movie couldve done with even less more and human interaction since the story was too straightforward to be told by humans and very understandable to be told throughout the kaijus and the world itselfvisually the movie was great and very pleasing to the eyes and the cgi was great with no specific mistakes to remember i prefer godzilla vs kong over this one because the whole idea and story was more intriguingit deserves a watch on the big screen
im not a particular fan of these movies but this one was funlikeable charactersinteresting storylines  nice progressionsome humour that worksfx are a mixed bagmy main gripe is that i see no redeeming features in godzilla  it looks silly it looks sillier when moving at speed its not cute or impressivekong more than makes up for that  especially in this has a bit of a hard time bless himthe movie works and is just on the right side of sentimentalthe humans are good too delivering the expected comedy turns annoyance and arrogance where requiredmore words to meet the silly character limit
my son is a big godzilla fan so i took him to see this in the cinema im afraid we had been thoroughly spoiled by last years godzilla minus one which was a tremendous film even if you have no interest in godzilla its just a very good filmi was hoping this one would be a next installment of the previous big budget hollywood attempts sadly nothe budget was there and the monster were great but this film lacked any real purpose to the extent the writer  director seemed to get a bit confused at how to play it it kept lurching from straight action to exceptional cliche to tongueincheek humour the character trapper being a good example i wad expecting him to look straight to camera and give a cheeky wink to the audience half the timewatch it for the monsters but dont expect to get anything remotely memorable from the story or human actors
godzilla and kong stand as two colossal icons in the realm of cinema and their monumental  film was hailed as a savior of theaters globally injecting muchneeded energy with its epic monster battles and departure from the trend of weighty serious narratives fresh from experiencing its latest installment on imax im eager to share my comprehensive thoughts on the filmin essence godzilla x kong the new empire left me spellbound it delivered a plethora of captivating action sequences each imbued with excellent camera work and jawdropping cgivisual effects that seamlessly brought the titans to life however it was kong who truly stole the spotlight as the films central protagonist his journey was nothing short of amazing drawing viewers into his world with expressive emotion and mannerisms that transcended dialogue making the visual storytelling an absolute delight from heartwarming interactions with fellow titans like suko to intense confrontations with formidable foes like skar king kongs character arc was a rollercoaster of emotions culminating in a satisfying resolution that showcased his growth and resiliencethe films action sequences were not merely excellent they were downright exhilarating each fight scene was meticulously choreographed utilizing established franchise elements with creative flair from gravitydefying showdowns to pulsepounding battles in the heart of bustling cities every moment was etched into the audiences memory building towards an electrifying climax that left viewers on the edge of their seats what truly set this film apart was its homage to the showa era seamlessly blending the franchises trademark goofiness with modern sensibilities eliciting cheers and applause from the audience at every turnone of the films most commendable aspects was its masterful pacing and intricate plotting with three intertwining storylines  kongs journey the human plot and the godzilla subplot  the film kept viewers engaged from start to finish kongs narrative arc was undeniably the standout but the human plot while not groundbreaking showed marked improvement over previous monsterverse projects characters like jia and trapper added depth and dimension to the story while the godzilla subplot provided a constant undercurrent of tension and anticipation building towards a climactic showdown that was as epic as it was satisfyingfurthermore the film boasted a memorable villain whose presence loomed large over every scene cruel menacing and eerily captivating the antagonist served as the perfect foil to our heroic protagonists driving the narrative forward with each nefarious scheme and dastardly deed the films worldbuilding was equally impressive offering tantalizing glimpses into a rich and expansive universe teeming with lore and intriguedespite some criticisms online particularly regarding godzillas screen time i found such complaints to be unfounded while kong may have dominated the narrative godzillas presence was felt in every frame his looming shadow serving as a constant reminder of the impending clash between titans moreover to dismiss the film as mere dumb fun would be a disservice to its rich storytelling and nuanced character development from kongs emotional journey to the human characters personal struggles and triumphs the film offered a depth and complexity that transcended its actionpacked exteriorin conclusion godzilla vs kong the new empire is more than just a blockbuster spectacle its a triumph of storytelling and visual artistry that pays homage to its iconic predecessors while blazing a trail of its own with its unforgettable characters breathtaking action sequences and heartpounding suspense this film is a testament to the enduring power of cinema and a worthy addition to the pantheon of monster classics
godzilla x kong the new empire is the sequel to s godzilla vs kong and the fifth film in legendary pictures monsterverse once again directed by adam wingard and starring rebecca hall brian tyree henry and kaylee hottle it delivers what it promises for fans of kaiju action with a handful of pleasant surprises along the wayfollowing the events of godzilla vs kong both the giant ape kong and the giant reptilian godzilla have agreed to keep their distance from one another leading to a safer world as a result kong has since made his home within the depths of hollow earth while godzilla continues to swim the surface worlds oceans only occasionally emerging to attack any invasive kaiju one day kong ventures deeper into hollow earth where he discovers something huge that could threaten the very existence of not only his species but all life on the surface quickly realising that he cannot handle this threat alone kong attempts to form an unlikely alliance with his fierce rival godzilla before both hollow earth and the surface world is destroyedten years since its debut legendary pictures monsterverse has managed to give western audiences their own cinematic universe of giant monsters with japans iconic kaiju godzilla leading the way in his own selftitled  film joining this colossal reptilian from the east is the equally famous king kong or just kong for short from the west who also had similar success after first appearing in s kong skull island it was inevitable that these two kaiju would face off against one another which is exactly what happened in godzilla vs kong marking the first time since  that both monsters have appeared in the same movie together after that fight ended in a decisive draw it seemed uncertain what direction things would head from there but in godzilla x kong the new empire we see the pair working together in an entertaining followup that once again showcases great special effects and that signature kaiju destructionrather than focus on two separate stories at once this time the plot is mostly centred around kong by himself though he is a powerful and respected figure among the inhabitants of hollow earth kong still needs to assert his dominance whenever necessary much like any gorilla he demonstrates this through physical combat and by roaring loudly while pounding his chest however like any primate curiosity gets the better of him as he decides to explore further into hollow earth to find out what lies beneath of course what he ends up discovering poses a threat to his position of power which later leads to some interesting lore about the origins of both kong and the other kaiju who call this planet home these scenes are what i would consider to be the best parts of the film as they allow us to see that kong isnt just a mindless monster who wants to destroy everything he sees but in fact a curious animal with a natural instinct to remain at the top of the food chainmaybe its the better special effects or maybe its the better way the mythology is handled but i actually found myself more invested in this story than i did with the previous film this is likely due to the way the film is told primarily from kongs perspective as when we see him learn more about ancient life in hollow earth we are learning along with him from his surprised expressions to his determination to defeat his opponents the visuals do a fine job at clueing us in to how kong must be feeling on this journey into unknown territory as a result kong is a surprisingly relatable character this time around at least by giant gorilla standardson the other hand godzillas role in this story has been significantly sidelined in favour of his mammalian rival whenever we see him on screen godzilla is either fighting off any large miscellaneous kaiju that dare to appear on the surface or he is swimming around looking for another place to rest humorously it would seem that godzilla has taken a preferential liking to curling up inside the roman colosseum to sleep in the same way a dog might curl up in its own fluffy bed in any other case i would be annoyed that the king of the monsters has been reduced to playing second fiddle to kong but remembering that he has already had two other solo movies that adequately established all we need to know about his character i wasnt nearly as botheredas is usually the case with giant monster movies there are plenty of action sequences and scenes of chaotic destruction that are sure to keep audiences satisfied with what theyve paid to see for example we see kong punching his way though large mysterious creatures who attack him and we watch godzilla smashing through skyscrapers and other landmarks to destroy any other kaiju that threaten his territory out of all these parts i found the scenes with kong to be the most exciting due to him being the more emotionally sympathetic of the two monsters thats not to say i didnt enjoy godzillas scenes at all as he certainly has some memorable moments too especially during the films climax its worth noting that most of the time kong is merely defending himself from opposition while godzilla is usually the instigator of his largescale fightsregarding the human characters they all serve their respective purpose to the story and nothing more i didnt really care much for rebecca hall or brian tyree henrys roles in the story other than for them to quote exposition that godzilla and kong cannot verbally communicate to the audience though they were far from annoying i just wish there was a way for them to have had a more memorable impact on the story other than being the stock humans with scientific knowledge on the titular monsters it is clear that these two human characters are only there to set things up for the next action scene involving either kong godzilla or both of them at once meaning that practically anybody could have played their rolesthe closest the film comes to having an emotional moment with a human character is with the deaf girl jia kaylee hottle who is able to communicate with kong using sign language without spoiling too much there is one scene with her and kong that i found quite touching which is more than can be said for all the other human characters whose names i can barely remember at the end of the day this lack of human drama doesnt really matter because as i said once before we dont pay to see a monster movie for the human characters the same way we dont go to mcdonalds to order a filet mignon then again if godzilla minus one was able to accomplish greatness along these lines then the potential was certainly there at leastfor yet another giant monster movie filled with gratuitous destruction and chaos galore godzilla x kong the new empire is a worthy addition to the decade old monsterverse that promises to entertain with its great visuals and plentiful action scenes as i said about the films predecessor you shouldnt expect anything less from a movie that has godzilla and kongs names in the title and once again thats just what we get im curious to see what direction the franchise will head in from this point forward as there are a number of ways this story could continue with its already established mythology until then im satisfied with simply watching these giant monsters beat the hell out of each other for our own amusementi rate it 
seriously the initial godzilla remake back in  with brian cranston was x better than the last few godzillakong moviesthe second godzilla king of monsters had the ability to separate itself from the pack and to think all that they had to do is listen to actual godzilla fans the monsters are great the kids arentwe dont care about kidsteenagersfamilies in a godzilla movie godzilla should be the star of the showwe dont want the story to revolve around kidsstop with the one liners hollywood has become so accustomed to godzilla should be a rather serious movie not a marveldcu flickfire your writers for crying out loud the story is so so bad it is beyond cringeget a decent couple of adult actors i mean the scripts are so bad i dont think ive ever seen vera farmiga in a worse movie than the second film decent writing pulls decent cast poor writing if youre lucky youll get the rock or mark wahlberg please dontwatch the anime series of godzilla or even the original films they have a substance you guys will never createit is called passionnot everyone has an iq of  and the ability to sit through this garbage for  hours sometimes i wish i was a complete moron then i could happily enjoy the endless dribble hollywood pumps out
this movie was fantastic for what it was it was a fantastic spectacle to see lots and lots of character development for kong in this movie as well just godzilla himself i dont know why the critics are bashing this movie so hard its not meant to be some modern allegory on the state of the world or anything its a kaiju monster battle and in that department it delivers heavily love this movie for what it was not what im projecting it to be or what i want it to be anyone basing their decision to watch this film based on what the critics have to say is missing out tremendously on a fantastic film
okay this movie was definitely crazy but im not sure yet if it was crazy good or crazy bad this is the type of film which had everything the story kept driving its audience to unexpected places sometimes very weird places but somehow at the end it felt like something was missingi have the feeling like wingard the writers and producers wanted to emulate the craziness of movies like thor ragnarok or even the previous godzilla v kong and that was all fine and good however its also evident that they never had much idea what to make with godzilla in this entry and as a result his screen time felt much reduced most of the occasions he was on screen though they made sure for him to take over the showmost of the fighting scenes also felt quite short and i dont understand why godzilla felt so threatened by the villains but whatever kong was the real star of this movie along with his little sidekick the human characters were good enough and jia was specially goodin the end i wont deny i had fun watching this movie but to me it was a downgrade when compared with godzilla v kong some aspects of the story definitely felt rushed which might have been solved if given just a bit more care from the screen writers and the director oh well
the movie has some fun moments and a few jokes made me smile but overall the movie is a bit of a mess with really average cgi i felt after seeing dune  and how amazing the scale of everything felt there that this just felt really average on a visual level the fights didnt really do anything for me either there was alot of fighting but i never got goosebumps or felt excited by any of it it was pretty underwhelming godzilla also didnt get enough screentime its a movie made for kids basically maybe im just getting old dune  was one of the best cinematic experiences ive had in years but this fell short big time
i watched the  godzilla vs kong movie again right before seeing this sequel and can comfortably say that i enjoyed it more not a great deal more but it was a fun watchboth movies basically switched back and forth between three storylines the big difference for me was that all three storylines in this film held my attention while only one of them did in the  film one of the storylines in the former film i didnt care for was the one involving the two annoying kids trying to figure out what was going on along with an unfunny comic relief podcaster fortunately the kids didnt appear in the new film and althoughbernie hayes did he was a bit more tolerable here but its still obvious that hes there just for the comic reliefalthough not citizen kane the film did manage to bring together the three storylines satisfactorily with the typical monster allmonsterbattle conclusion and as a bonus a guest star monster from godzillas past made an appearanceoverall the film was two hours of entertaining brain candy like the  film the special effects were great and the monsters more entertaining than the actors as long as you approach it that way you should enjoy it
with the territory dispute settled between godzilla and kong monarch sets out to monitor godzilla on the surface and explore hollow earth with kong as kong searches for remnants of his species something has godzilla in a frenzy on the surface what they discover in hollow earth teaches them more about the history of the titans and requires kong and godzilla to team up to save the worldthis franchise has drifted away from the original premise of king kong and godzilla but has managed to create something unique and entertaining the story is simple with loads of classic characters and some epic battles the monsters have slowly developed human characteristics and mannerisms which can be good or bad depending on the person overall the movie is easy to watch familyfriendly for older children and has components of the classics which might satisfy longtime fans
fight scenes were top tier and the action was good only part i didnt like was the part where the girl was basically the main character they did not even try to make her a main character she wouldve been fine as a side character or maybe i just see her as the main character because they havent even set the main character yet unlike in godzilla king of the monsters also for some reason the didnt go in the direction of government trying to capture and study the girl wasted story maybe next time also theyre over using the godzilla x kong formula its gonna get stale quick they should go back to solo movie or introduce another charecter
why has cgi become so crappyand most importantly why do we tolerate iti wont comment on the acting direction editing or even the plotits godzilla vs kong in any casebut i will comment on the terrible cgi in movies of the last couple of years like the flashit seems like cgi artists have given up on trying to make photorealistic effects and replaced them with crappy visuals from video games of the previous decadesbad compositing the mix of cgi with live action or other elements unrealistic coloring unnecessary flares cartoonish movements and well you can forget about physicsthis movie feels like the opening of a video game from the s the first jurassic park from  is far more convincing you cant watch and have an emotional connection with movies like thisif its supposed to be a cartoon or animation just say soif we continue to endorse and support creators who dont care about quality then its on usperhaps they know that the end is coming for them due to ai and stopped caringoverall not just avoid but punish movies like this one maybe theyll start trying more
i saw this movie on imax d recently at fast let me start with the good things i found about godzilla x kong the new empire this movie has good and the best vfx and action i saw godzilla in many forms most likely blue thermonuclear and last pink thermonuclear forms was awesome and new character suko is very cute and kong adopted suko and mothras special appearance and was amazing and giving a great slap to godzilla and kong rides on godzilla giving goosebumps and all the fours are crashing talking about a human character like bunnys acting was very funny the new hero trappers last entry is so cool now let me say that i was as disappointed about godzilla x kong when was godzilla fighting with scylla for just  seconds and tiamat also just  or  seconds i thought it would be at least  minute btw i want to see this movie  more time thank you to adam wingard for thinking of such a great story
godzilla x kong the new empireso we got a godzilla  kong sequel with a really alluring trailer thanks to its undeniable cool factor and im somehow inspired to check it out despite not being that wellversed with the monsterverse let alone being a fan of it but i got a friend who is and the trailer does manage to elicit enough curiously within me to go out of my way to see it so how was it well that feels like déjà vu does it not didnt the  godzilla installment get me to contort my body in all types of ways and yawn up watery eyes thanks to sheer boredom well suffice it to say its happening again for a second time despite that im willing to give this one the benefit of the doubt as my stomach is rendered uneasy thanks to certain things ive been consuming recently which also affected my whole body seriously i just feel fatigable the whole day whats that all about as opposed to how i felt watching king of the monsters almost half a decade ago with my aforementioned best friend whos a monsterverse aficionado while being fit as a fiddle in other words yes its a bit better but not by much and the reason this movie manages to earn slightly more meritorious qualities is two words kaylee hottle yes the taciturn superstar that stole the show once again she did it on the previous godzilla film and she did it again here seriously there arent enough levels of verbosity that can do justice to an encomium that she so ever deserves since her primordial appearance in the franchise two years ago her performances are stellar as she plays an intrinsic role to the film which renders her preeminent while everyone else is concomitant thank you adam wingard not to mention shes also responsible for some of the more tearjerking moments in the film which correlates with sentiments of not fitting in letting go and undying love for one another and yes the whole thing about her not making friends grades in a state of dégringolade and being an outcast at school is all too relatable feels like theyre calling me out the only difference is shes deaf and im not so stop complaining you inutile piece of but anyways i feel like i gave a fair amount of conferment towards the star of the show already lets move on to the rest of the cast shall we now while theyre not bad theyre nothing great either theyre just generic mediocre figures that are so heavily outshined by jias character that if she wasnt here this would fare worse than king of the monsters for me the supposed comic reliefs trapper and bernie the easygoing immature vet and a fraidy influencer who wants to prove to people he saved the world once are not funny nor are they obnoxiously bad they just dont really do all that much for me and as for jias mom ilene andrews her presence is only accentuated by jias presence for being her cornerstone which i will commend her for but aside from that shes just as lukewarm as the other two present here but of course the price of admission is paid to witness gargantuan mindless monsters beat the crap out of each other while roaring at the top of their huge lungs every  minutes or so and yes while we do get an abundance of that its not something i particularly find to be all that interesting to be honest overgrown ugly simians the word rhymes with hideous for a reason too dumb to know anything else beyond collateral damage running rampant against each other is a lot more lackluster than i initially thought it would be of course what elevates them from just being soulless primal smackdowns are the subtle themes of survival respect and teamwork in order to avoid spoilers im not going to fully expound what took place only that i find the action sequences despite being well made thanks to boasting stateoftheart special effects and adept cgi workers to be discernibly laborious when compared to scenes with jia in it im sorry and im watching this in an onyx cinema hall where the seats vibrate and stuff thats saying something yeah all in all its a decent film i do think the previous installment hit slightly harder thanks to fairly compelling villains abusing the power of science and intelligence and action sequences thats considerably better thanks to its more scifi elements courtesy of mechagodzilla but this ones not too bad either mostly because of kaylee hottle she brought the previous film out of the realm of just being solid and now she brought this one out of the realm of mediocrity much love shes worth the tickets alone if the initial allure of mindless monster action and pulchritudinous sceneries to expose the audience to kaylee hottles jias more compelling character arc and performance was the plan then im on board solid stuff words
so i had to take clients to the movies today and this was the only one they hadnt seen so this was what they pickedi was expecting a monster movie and not anything really intelligent but these kinds of movies can still be fun i was totally wrongthis movie was terrible i have seen many films and this was honestly one of the worst i have ever seen if i wasnt with clients there is no way i would have sat through itthe actors had nothing to work with and they were kind of pointless it was just basically  hours of cgi and really loud noises how many times did these creatures need to howli havent seen the first one and i never will total garbage and it should be avoided
godzilla x kong is a big improvement over the previous entry king ve godzilla especially with the human element which was so cardboard last time  the cg is done very well  although the new rival of kong seems very generic another giant ape called skar king  and then a whole tribe of giant gorillas and a baby one with a napoleon complex  the team up tag team between godzilla kong and skar king happens of late in the movie  mothra makes her grand appearance as the moderator telling kong and godzilla to set aside their alpha differences to battle skar king and his enslaved ice breathing giant lizard  which is the opposite of godzillas radioactive breath  its a fun movie just watch and enjoy the ride  heres one spoiler alert  no post credit scene 
"skull island was so well done
what theyre doing and did with king kong is greathis part of this movie plays out like a westernits just greatthe other stuff is useless
sure godzilla is cool and does his thingbut the people in these godzilla movies and the way they tell you what is happening as you are watching it happen or just watched it happen is mind numbingthere is no use for these people at all
and the dopey ancient backstory is so unneeded
let it go
leave it to the monstersi sat and put up with the dopey humans and enjoyed the destruction from godzilla
but i loved the king kong story and his scenes king kong 
godzilla 
people "
"rating 
overall a very stupid movie that has a dumb plot because the movie just feels like kong ft godzilla but has some merit in watching with its visual effects cinematography and grand monsterfilled fight scenespretty bad direction the direction is only good on a macroscale because the movie is only about building this vast mythical world and the massive fight scenes the direction on a microscale is pretty formulaic and bland as many of the performances just feel like they fill time the storytelling is not good as the movie does not create a coherent story it just feels like they force a bunch of plot points together decent acting decent to pretty good from rebecca hall plays the lead decently well and holds her own in getting the most out of the rest of the cast decent from brian tyree henry really tries his best to be the comedic relief character but he just isnt given good material to work with so he misses his jokes a lot decent from dan stevens has charisma that makes his character likable decent to pretty good from kaylee hottle does a pretty good job at being the emotional vulnerability in the movie and how she is a conduit between different groups pretty bad from the rest of the cast just a bunch of formulaic tentpole performances bad story the concept is so stupid because it just has dumb plot points like the first  minutes of the movie is about how kong has a toothache the plot structure is a complete mess as they focus way too much on kong that this movie feels like kong ft godzilla the character writing for the humans is very shallow and formulaic the character writing for godzilla is very shallow as hes just there the character writing for kong and the apes is pretty good as its all about finding a home bad screenplay the dialogue is very stupid the humor is pretty bad because it has a high miss rate the symbolism is kinda forced but surprising present despite how shallow it is the foreshadowing makes the movie predictable decent score good cinematography i dont know why they used imax cameras but they used it well and helped show this mythical world good editing very good sound really helped bring to life the monsters and titans especially godzilla and kong good to very good visual effects this movie is really about the visual effects as it helps bring to life the world the monsters and their fight scenes pacing is incredibly slow as this movie feels like it drags the first hour just feels like exposition the runtime couldve been  minutes longer to help show the relationship between godzilla and kong because it is very forced climax is very short even though it is well executed godzilla and kong are only in the movie for like  minutes together tone is just a stereotypical action monster movie very michael baylike this movie is kong ft godzilla because the two are only onscreen together for like  minutes and their relationship is super forced"
first off understand this movie shouldnt be compared to godzilla minus one and is a movie based on the legendary monsterverse movies fans who are going to see this movie are going to see this movie usually because of the showa era influence that the director adam wingard was going for with the flavor and he did just that with this film in a more modern wayi knew what i was in for when i saw the preview and having seen godzilla vs kong i had a good idea the direction that this movie was going the preview built up a lot of anticipation and i learned nothing was exactly as perceived from seeing the great looking interesting and action packed previewsthis movie is the movie ive been the most excited about seeing this year being a major godzilla fan and i am pretty easy to please when it comes to these movies and not the most critical of these kind of films i am going to mainly focus on what i loved about it with out giving anything away that the previews didntfirst off is how colorful the movie is and the theme of it being similar to s movies which there will be times where the great songs reflect that aspect of it i really loved what they did with the music i had to go ahead and say the hollow earth truly is a breathe taking world that reminds me of pandora from avatar and also similar to indiana jones with in itthe movie is far more about the monsters than it is the humans compared to the previous movies and the human characters are more so used to speak for the monsters story where about midway through i enjoyed one of their roles the most in telling the monsters backstory but i will have to say if this movie even was just the monsters id probably still be happy the human characters however prove to have their place eventually to set the plot into motion such as gia who ends up playing a really important rolethe monsters truly are characters and have much personality who come with some humorous moments kong is like a cowboy in a way and almost feels like clint eastwood to me skar king who is the orangutan villain you see in the preview really comes across as kind of an western villain with his attitude and mannerisms adam wingard even said in the commentary from the previous movie that he saw kong similar to a western character like clint eastwood that i thought was great inspiration to incorporate with kong and skar king in this moviethe battles are what most people will be raving about and are a blast to watch go down in this movie and were talking battles that have never been seen in a godzilla movie before with much inspiration from wrestling and will please those kids at heart who enjoyed their saturday morning cartoons again were talking showa era inspired herei felt by the end the movie had much heart and i actually found it surprisingly moving enough it truly is a epic blockbuster to me but one common complaint is how viewers would have liked to see more action and i for one wouldnt have minded that i mean a good movie will have you asking for more and maybe that being the case is validthis movie is more kongs story than anyone else with his human counterpart gia mirroring his journey another common complaint is how people would have liked to see more of godzilla but with what you get to see with godzilla left me satisfied enough and room for what could come in another movie more focused on godzilla and potentially one last one from adam wingard that i would love to see from himi was real happy that i saw the movie in imax and would highly recommend it for families as the kids will absolutely love this movie more than likely it was what was so great about the showa era movies its a great popcorn and soda movie that brings nonstop action with amusement and does have purpose one should understand by the end who gives it some more thought
godzilla and kong the new empire was definitely worth watching the scenes are amazing and the monster fights so much like the old godzilla monster mash ups but looking even bettertrue there isnt much human interaction except for a few scenes but the characters the human ones were tolerable youve got to remember this is a monster movie people want to see monsters fighting and you get those scenes in spades the human storyline is secondaryoverall this is a big silly fun movie that checks all the boxes for monster mash ups i enjoyed it for what it was great entertainment to turn your mind off to and have fun
it felt like too much happened too quickly but with that said it didnt feel like anything shouldve been cut out of the movie it couldve benefited from maybe a longer run time to better explain certain things that happened or at the very least add something that explains how much time has passed one second godzilla is here and now hes here kong is doing something important to the story blink oh hes done now even though it seems like it shouldve taken longer some of the sound seemed washed out for example godzillas roar just didnt feel loud or intimidating but that couldve just been the sound system in the theater i was at despite the rushed scenes and possibly poorly mixed audio it was nice to have godzilla and kong be the stars of their own movie instead of humans like the other movies made by legendary would watch again
i like a good kong or godzilla movie i really really do but this wasnt it as usual the creatures dominate the narrative and the people are there for exposition but really this is just an excuse for fx mass destructionmay be its just me but the sheer loss of life that would have gone down in rome cairo and rio would have been immense godzilla again traverses the globe in seconds without explanation one minute in the med then pops up in the artic kong can escape middle earth sorry hollow earth by somehow climbing out while to get in requires dropping miles through a swirly whirlpoolcaught it playing in d but theres nothing in it that warrants seeing it in this medium also the long periods of just fx creatures interacting and fighting was and im sorry to say boring
godzilla x kong the new empire is another fantastic entry in the monsterverse which even better than the previous film godzilla vs kong and more than delivers with its huge spectacle and great titan centered story and surprisingly entertaining human cast its great ride and will leave any godzilla and kong fan who wants to see the two team up against formidable foes more than satisfied the action scenes are spectacular the human cast this go around do actually are pretty entertaining and arent boring like youd expect the visuals must be seen on the biggest screen possible skar and shimo are great villains that give the big g and mighty k a run for their money and this film is all around another great installment in the monsterverse from adam wingard
just saw this movie last night in a theatre that was half full these movies have felt like a  or  out of  for me and that is about what i expected and that is what i got it was great to watch godzilla and kong and they did a great job on the graphics and the fights they seemed to listen to the main complaint in the last godzilla vs kong movie that they wanted more fights with godzilla and kong however the plot did not make sense as with most godzilla and kong movies the plot for the people is terrible as usual they tried to make the people save the day in a way that is unrealistic and adds nothing the storyoverall the movie is worth seeing you enjoy godzilla and kong and want to fast forward past the people to the fights
yay another godzilla vs kong movie a chance to lose shed excess iq points faster than rapid onset dementiathe movie starts with kong on his island escaping some big dogs and killing one in an unnecessarily gory fatality movie scares other dogs awaykong has toothache after been punched by evil red ape goes to humans for dental service gets big dumb anesthetic injection and big dumb metal tooth from humans humans go dumb side story with shamans and mystical stuff my brain dont understand boring lady has boring romance with boring australian guy also boring mute girl movie thinks its avatar for a while but after long boring time goes back to monsters fightingkong is good ape red apes bad except for red baby ape so movie not racist against red apes show individual can be good and prejudice bad red ape control ice power godzilla with glowing rod red ape ride ice godzilla real godzilla now with pink energy kong roar at pyramids pink godzilla climb on gibraltar rock also roar next scene fight at pyramids smash pyramids glowy moth appear and then friends then scene with disco music other music garbage go braaaah and bam baaaaam all movie but disco and synthwave tracks fun human characters lame everyone different accent cant understandrandom beach scene with samba music maybe in brazil camera turn around then red ape and ice godzilla vs kong and pink godzilla big stupid big fight baby red ape show up kong steals fatality move from sub zero kong x godzilla x mortal kombat nowmy brain hurts but am dumber now therefore happier next monster movie when
this movie was amazing its a kong centered movie with godzilla making cameos here and there but its fine i like both of them equally i was little bit iffy on godzillas new evolution but its grown on me he looks way more powerful than he was in the previous films and of course the best part for me was the final battle godzilla and kong charging at skar king and shimo and fighting in zero gravity and of course mothras return was especially amazing also its cool that kong has adopted suko as his son and formed a bond all the minus one stans can screw off  would watch again
it feels more like this is an avengers movie and not a godzillakong onesure its a fun watch and theres cool moments here and there i also liked the villain a lot the way he moved and his facial expressions were really uncanny and a bit scary i wouldve liked to see more about him how he became the king of the giant apes his fight with godzilla in the past and his banishment and how he defeated shimoi didnt like that godzilla did basically nothing the entire movie almost all the focus was on kong and the little iwi girl they couldve sold the movie as kong and mothra as well because she had pretty much the same screen time as godzillaand i dont know how to feel about kong feeling sad hes been shown as this unstoppable force that only responds to that iwi girl kinda like hulk but now hes acting more like a human he gets sad because he doesnt feel comfortable in his new home he is grossed out when he gets dirty in a fight he pretty much cries because of a tooth infection and goes with the humans to get helpand theres also a lot of conveniences in the movie like when kong gets frostbite and they casually have a giant gauntlet made specifically for him thats undamaged and ready to use or that mothra is there and only the iwi girl can wake her up and then the huge special attack they can only do once by clashing the two giant crystal pyramids which doesnt even do that much honestly and feels like they wasted iti dont regret watching it and i didnt have a lot of expectations after watching the trailer but its just a mediocre film
godzilla and kong is a simple movie in its premise since it only wants to entertain and to show big monsters fighting so it has also to be judged in this framework unfortunately the movie is not able to achieve this due to useless and long boring sections centered around humans and their story arcs indeed when the movie shows the monsters it is good for what it is with fun and entertaining scenes furthermore the monsters are characterized thanks to convincing facial expressions which are able to convey what they are thinking on the flip side the parts featuring humans are boring and most importantly too long they were present also in the previous chapter godzilla vs kong but they were shorter and less serious and so in the end if youll be able to overcome those scenes and they will not become an issue to you the movie will feel fine and fun if however like in my case these scenes are able to provoke a lot of boredom the viewing can be more problematic indeed when the movie flows it is very good when it features the humans its the total opposite in my opinion  minutes less dedicated to the humans and a shorter movie would have created one of the most entertaining blockbuster movie of the year
i did not know there was a monsterverse but that seems apropos for a movie about two gigantic prehistoric creature monsters that are always warring with something or somebodyi went to this movie for mindless escape and thats what i got a lot of loud sound effects and huge monsters filling up the screenthe story  what story it meanders all over the scifi fantasy universehow did godzilla and kong get into the same space to duel over europe i dunno but thats where you suspend disbelief and just laugh it offthe kids will love it because it has loud and roaring noises and the special effects of the hollow ground are eye popping
the new empire doesnt exactly shed itself of all the issues ive had with the monsterverse movies so far but it thankfully lessens the things ive been frustrated with and it made for quite a fun ridedont get me wrong the characters still arent up too much i dont think theyre that deep or particularly memorable but they are likeable they have genuinely good chemistry and even if i felt the film couldve taken itself a bit more seriously at points i still found it a lot funnier than it had any right to be theres also significantly less of them compared to king of the monsters and godzilla vs kong and it does wonders for the pacingsince theyre not trying to balance so many characters and subplots it makes the whole thing feel much more streamlined and i can honestly say i was never bored which was not my experience with the last films its very fast paced but more importantly it always felt like there was something important happening dont get me wrong its no masterpiece of writing the dialogue is still bland and the story nonexistent but for what i needed from this film it hit just the right sweet spoti also loved the fact that there were whole sections devoted exclusively to kong in past instalments this time probably wouldve gone to boring human characters but this is much more along the line of what i want to see the kills are brutal the actions fun and even if it devolves a bit too much into cgi noise in the rd act i still thought it was fun with some actual sense of scaleafter very little anticipation from me in a long stretch of these movies that i havent really enjoyed this was quite a pleasant surprise its not immune to all this series flaws but its been more than refined enough to create for an enjoyable experience its no minus one but its a lot more fun than i ever wouldve expected
wow i dont know how to explain this movie it was great in resolution and talking now this was a great movie i dont even think there are words to express how this was made the animation was great so much was added to this short movie i say short mostly because its shorter than an average movie of  hours it had so much story not just on kong but the iwi tribe as well this is a must watch not just on a tv in the theaters now i dont like to put spoilers but near the end towards the middle was a great scene i thought this movie was not going to be moving via worldwide but the part i didnt like about this was the fact that the fights were at world known visitor spots rio egypt rome france besides that it was awesome watch it please
just how great a great movie godzilla minus one is it had a miniscule budget the special effects were better and the story was far superiorgxk was so farfetched and unbelievable and yes i know a giant monster movie isnt really believable but still that you just dont end up caring what happens in it i can see the director thinking lets put in a lot of color and kong will wear the infinity gauntlet because thats what fans like to hide what a mess this movie is i also cant stand putting dumb characters into a movie for comedic effect no one talks or acts like the stereotypical dumb character doesin the end i was actually hoping skar king had defeated kong and godzilla at least that way the franchise could have potentially ended on a fairly exciting note instead of going out on an embarrassing movie like this one
only people with high enough testosterone level can truly appreciate this movie it was a truly eye opening philosophical and beautiful on so many levels piece of cinema the conversations the cinematography the acting it was all a masterpiece i cannot express how grateful i was to the world we live in for providing me with the unique opportunity to witness this heavenly movie which looked like it was provided by god almighty himself i loved how the director made godzilla sleep in in the colliseum thus referring to the glory of the roman empire between the incredible plot they managed to even put a history lesson by shooting different scenes in a historical cites

i busted out laughing because of the simplicity she gave this massive franchise with this massive character that goes back decades this is one of the reasons why i love nana she will make you laugh for surewell the gorilla and the lizard showed up and showed out entertaining all of us at one point i didnt know if i was watching an avengers film or a kong and godzilla film the action was jampacked and frankly they were doing things that they shouldnt be capable of doingthere were a lot of parts that were overdone or very wonky something made you scratch your head and ask how the heck did they get to this point it didnt make sense at times but just go with it shockingly godzilla in all these films has very little screen time in this film he didnt even crack double digits it doesnt matter though because you cant tell while youre watching ita film with a lot going on that still wont stop you from having fun and being entertained while watching it it pleases people of all ages which is comforting to know box office smash so expect another filmi love godzilla and especially king kong he didnt disappoint and he made sure to let everyone know he was not to be messed with no matter who you were kong walked around with the you know what energy the whole film try not to take certain scenes too seriously just enjoy this film on the biggest screen you can find i give this film four mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥cosmoandthemoviewithin

initially when i saw the trailers for godzilla x kong i was a bit excited for the new entry a team up of the  most well known modern day monsters with all out action normally this should be a slam dunk but i think the problem with this movie is that there is literally nowhere to go with the story that we havent beenin a nutshell the scientists working at monarch detect signal anomalies that are coming from hollow earth but cant figure out its origin and who is sending them they trek on downward discover the signals origin  discover that there is a villainous gorilla like kong who is trying to escape and reign terror on those living up top godzilla  kong teamup hence the title of the film many punches and kicks are thrown along with a few wrestlingesque moves and the villain is defeateddoesnt really sound too bad for a plot in fact in this movie they finally put more emphasis on the monsters story over the human story and let this drive the chaos and spectacle the bad part is there really isnt anything new that we havent seen in the past  godzilla movies  kong skull island im sorry but there are only so many times i care to watch godzilla  kong fight other giant kaiju monsters threatening humanityearth before it simply becomes boring is the action fun for the most part it is entertaining and the pure visual spectacle in the imax version which opens up from standard letterbox aspect ratio which the previous movies didnt makes for a fun  entertaining ride but again weve seen both godzilla  kong fight monsters and destroy cities to last us a lifetimeadd to the fact that the cgi visual effects that show us hollow earth looks really artificial and weak and you have what amounts to a middling film dont get me wrong there are definitely places where the vfx blends well or looks appropriate but there are definitely clear spots where you can tell its not photorealistic at all and that is disappointing considering the money spent on this compared to last years godzilla minus one which was far superior visuallyis there anywhere left to go with this franchise not really unless you just want more monster chaos  action i think if they put out any more movies in this series they need to be  minutes or less any longer and it will just become more and more boring and lead to fatiguego see this if youre a kaijugodzillakong fan it will deliver wait for it on streaming if youre hoping for something more along the lines of godzilla minus one
technically super impressive the story is also very straight forward if you like godzilla and kong it means you came to see gigantic fights and massive scale screenshots and that is what you get watching this movie and to get the ultimate engagement you have to watch it at cinema dolby or imax i watched it in a dolby cinema and enjoyed it from the first minute to the last not sure why it had  score does people expect a complex story from a godzilla and kong movie i decided to give it a high score because it deserves it you cannot compare this movie with eg dune i expected a straight forward movie many fights no low pace great production and it checked all of it so if you are a fan of godzilla and kong go watch it at cinema and enjoy
starts off again as a day in the life of kong reality tv just like in godzilla vs kong i loved that it didnt feel like it was made for imax at the start then i just kinda got used to it didnt have that much depth could notice this in close up scenes and parts of the screen looked blurry wish id seen it in rpx or a similar format for a more immersive experiencekong is always lonely man it was great to see him find new apes also how did that little monkey survived being slammed around and then being used as a batting stick by kong lolthis movie had a distinctly video gamelike quality both in its graphics and the action sequences a lot of green screen however it was pretty fun i especially enjoyed the fight in the desert also i wanted godzilla to lift his feet so bad when he was walking out of italy back to the video gamey feel like watching godzilla run was cool and kong riding but it was really video gamey to me i saw a little of that in the trailersit was giving me jumanji vibes the stakes were really high but the movie felt simply fun its arguably the most fun packed installment in the monsterverse yet however i wished it had retained a slightly darker more serious tone akin to earlier godzilla films while scar king was formidable his jokes sometimes undercut the seriousness the movie lacked the intimidating atmosphere that earlier godzilla movies captured due to the overall fun vibe of the filmlike i always remember the scene where godzilla finally showed up at the airport in godzilla or when rodan destroyed the city in king of the monsters or the storm this movie didnt have those vibes and i miss it still pretty fun but instead of having my breath taken away i was just watching in this movie like oh that looks cool while laid back in my seatanother thing not specific to this movie scenes like this always shock me when theyre in the jungle and the local tribe in camouflaged are these warriors just lurking standing still in the bushes  waiting for a trespassers its not logical but almost always looks coolthe movie is quite ambitious especially when it came to the iwi tribe in hallow earth there was so much lore and science added into the franchise it was so compact and filled i also like that the tribe spoke telepathically reminds me of the scene in kong skull island when someone said they dont speak muchcertain scenes felt rushed such as how quickly they obtained the mechanical arm it did seem overly convenient and the movie couldve benefited from more development the overall pacing of the movie with a rush to get to the big fight gave it a sense of being hurried for me almost like a speed run through minimissions to get to this big fight it felt as though they were hesitant to make the movie longer and i wish it was extended it by  minutes could have allowed for more depth and nuancei cant believe icy godzilla just ended up being a lovely pet dog and godzilla is sleeping in italy like a cat anyway so many parts of the movie are great the action ambition and overall fun vibe making it highly enjoyable for many viewers while i think its good or kinda good i do wish it were slightly longer and had a darker tone it feels like a departure from the tone of earlier godzilla films and seems to target a slightly differentbroader audience a lot of people seemed to like it a lot of kids too while it may not fully meet my expectations its still a movie worth watching for its entertainment value i guess
not sure how you can enjoy a movie like this if you are an adult anyway the best thing here is maybe the actors rebecca hall dan stevens brian t henry the rest is awful i am amazed that grown ups gather in a room to discuss a script and they come up with something that stupid it is worse than the previous one which was already terrible there is no stake in the story cgi keeps getting worse baby kong compare it with what we were seeing  years ago or what planet of the apes was doing more recently and you know that they gave up investing in cgi they try to fill the screen with more stuff more monsters more destructions they should have respected the premise of the king kong story which is quite simple that we might have forgotten animal species on this planet not a fantasy with some stupid hollow earth below our feet with dinosaurs monsters and magic it is not fun to watch it is an insult to our intelligence come on
 godzilla  kong  the new empire movie review directed by adam wingard the film is the sequel to godzilla vs kongplot of the moviethis time kong encounters a mightier enemy  skar king  he needs the help of godzilla to put an end to skar kings storywill kong be able to succeedanalysis of the moviethe movie initially starts with a slow pace but after some time a hint of something will happen is being generated the first half goes into this curiositythe second half is about unveiling the mystery of how the skar king is connected to godzilla and kongthe screenplay journey will not make you happy to the fullest as after a certain point i was expecting a blow but no it takes us to the height of the patience and then it breaks the last  minutes of power packed action blended with d specs gives us goosebumps its like the srk  salman come together for an action in pathaanfrom the technical aspect the visualisation of the hollow earth the habitation of iwi community in the hollow earth had been beautifully taken it makes us believe that these are not fiction although we know its a fictional moviebgm while entrance of godzilla gives the audience a feel of anxiety as whether godzilla is coming for war or for something else as its character journey had been portrayed respectively in the screenplaythe basic plot of the movie is an evil to conquer the throne of power will go to the extreme to fulfill but there are some fearless who turn that into just a dreamthis plot we had seen in many movies in different versions but what makes this movie worth watching is how this concept they blend with the mythology of the protagonist characters which makes the audience convince able
im entertained but the movie is popcorn wb is wellaware of what the audience wants  cgi monster fight scenes  and they give it in full storyline of the human characters are reduced to contextualizing and driving the narrative toward more titan faceoffs however despite their little screen time all actors gave convincing enough performances rebecca hall a tenderhearted mother and brian tyree henry a comedic normie whos not overly cringy the plot of the monsters is pretty simple as well but its revealed gradually throughout the film either by human narration or physical language which i think is a smart choice for a commercial production however too much screen time for titans makes me lose track of how big the creatures are which is quite underwhelming for a movie about giant monsters  the production tries to make it up by using shaky cameras and earthmoving sound effect but somewhere along the second act i just dont see kong as large as he is in skull island finally the action sequences are heavily budgeted ax spine whip ice rays barbie rays mechanical boxing glove flying buildings destruction of important cultural relics and most satisfyingly no human intervention if you like how the transformers smashed the pyramids to smithereens youll love this movie
i am honestly glad we are getting more movies in the monsterverse the movies have been amazing or anything but they have been thoroughly entertaining after godzilla vs kong we are getting a teamup movie with godzilla x kong the new empire does this continue to be entertaining or is this finally the entry that bores youyou came to this movie for big monsters fighting and in this aspect the movie succeeds there are a great many fight scenes in this movie especially with kong i love the way kong fights and how you can clearly see how he is strategizing and planning compared to godzillas ferocious animalistic style they also created a new villain for kong with the scar king i love the design of him and his more agile style of fighting the movie builds up to an epic rd act brawl and it is insanely entertaining and worth watching for it alonethe cgi is pretty good considering that this is the cheapest monsterverse movie so far hollow earth looks great and kong looks phenomenal godzilla has a new pink design for story reasons and it looks fine there are some visually greatlooking shots by returning cinematographer ben seresin that capture the mystical nature of hollow earth and the titans kong is the main lead in this film and he is the standout star there are many scenes with just kong and other apes that go on for  minutes long with no dialogue or humans and they work so well just through kongs facial expression and body language you can perfectly understand the emotion and the story that is being conveyed it is impressive in terms of human characters trapper played by dan stevens is a fun newcomer he has excellent chemistry with returning character bernie played by brian tyree henryunfortunately the story concerning the human characters is still incredibly dumb there are many questionable and stupid things such as why they only brought one armed soldier for a mission or why even a conspiracy podcaster is even involved in the mission the human characters are still not interesting or engaging enough to care about they tried to incorporate the motheranddaughter relationship plot element again with returning characters dr ilene rebecca hall and jia kaylee hottle but it doesnt work well because they dont explore it enough for the most part ilene is again the exposition character its a shame as godzilla minus one shows that you can do big monsters and engaging human characters in a moviethe pacing drops off significantly around the second act where it just has a bunch of humans talking and exposition dumps additionally godzilla is barely in this movie despite being the first in the title every fight scene concerning godzilla barely lasts a minute in the first  acts it is understandable to show how powerful godzilla is but it would have been nice to see the fights last a bit longer on that note while the fights are indeed entertaining they are not as well choreographed as the ones in godzilla vs kong junkie xl returns to score the music for this movie but it definitely lacks the impact that junkie usually does the music score is a bit forgettableoverall i came to see giant monsters fight and i got exactly that this feels like a very highbudget b movie and honestly that is completely fine godzilla x kong is another entertaining movie in the monsterverse and i hope more is made in this cinematic universe the possibilities are endless
godzilla was made famous because it was so different and just a monster flick so why in gods name does hollywood think we care to see reoccurring people from the previous filmsi couldnt care less for the russel family or this tribal girl you could legit have just news reports the white house or political figures talking debating and monsters just fightingthinking these types of flicks need all this extra crap kills my interest quick people may make fun of michael bays transformers but at least majority of it was actually filled with the autobots fightingsame with pacific rim i didnt like it a lot but its still more enjoyable than this
i think this addition to the godzilla x kong im not going to spoil anything but the way the monsters were and how they looked like a massive threat was absolutely flawless hence the reason for the headline i wrote heading in the right direction because obviously everyone knows that godzilla and kong partnered up as shown in the trailer do we really want to see the same movie over and over again the same monsters go toe to toe if you want that watch wwe lol but this is a direction that they have obviously put time and effort in so hopefully we get another godzilla and kong movie but hopefully jack black returns to the kong universe even as a cameo role to sort of rekindle his time with kong but only the future will tell loved this movie 👍🏼
a film about giant monsters fighting to the death was never going to be groundbreaking in terms of storytelling but nonetheless the godzilla x kong a new empire delivers exactly what fans have come to expectits visually impressive when it comes to the monster designs and its large scale action scenes its thrilling and there are some great references to showa era of the godzilla franchise however godzilla himself is sidelined in this film and kong once again seems to get more screen time that being said kong is definitely the heart of the film and shines every time hes on screen the human characters script and the pacing are probably the weakest elements of the film dan stevens and brian tree henry are the best human characters since they bring a well needed comedic flair it seems that the rest of the human characters are only really there to deliver clunky exposition that feels like it comes of nowhere and there are times the film is either very slow or going to fast like when it has time to breathe it suddenly picks up the speed again and i can barely have time to thinkoverall godzilla x kong is a flawed but very fun film that will please longtime fans but newcomers will be very confused or very uninterested
everyone involved in the making of this absolutely dreadful waste of time and money should be thoroughly be ashamed of themselves the writers should never be allowed to pen another draft of anything not even a text message or fill in a birthday card to their own parentsthe executives who gave the go ahead should now only have the key to the janitors cupboard the financiers shouldnt be allowed to have a bank account without guardianship they obviously can not be trusted with money as to the clowns who actually directed  put the whole thing on screen you should need a mcdonalds uniform for your next job
went watching this film this morning with my  year old son and wow did we enjoy it we have watched all the recent godzilla and kong films and enjoyed then all but this film knocks them all out of the park now i am not saying this is an oscar winning classic or a film for everyone but for the genre monster v monster action movie this cannot be beatenthe action  fight scenes just dont stop throughout the entirety of the film the monsters kong and godzilla come up against throughout the film are all different each time meaning the film brings to life a wide variety of different species  titans for the duo to battle against this means no one battle is the same and it is not the same two species fighting over and over again next the story might be nonsensical but it keeps the movie moving throughout and it explains everything to keep all viewers in the loop but lets be honest you dont go watching films like this one for the story you go to be entertained and this film definitely does that
"when a kaiju movie opens with an exotic scene and the subtitle somewhere in middle earth you instantly know youre back on king kongs turf after they transported him from skull island in the last kong movie to this wonderland underground on our planeta place where sunshines inexplicably and lush jungles thrive with absolutely no photosynthesisyes its bad science but we forgive them when they say if middle earth exists what else dont we know about this planet
a lot it would seem most of it needing no justification whatsoeverunlike the previous film which concentrated on a few stranger things scenarios this one brings back plenty of titans battling other titans and a few weve never met till nowno spoilers here just watch the trailerits been  years since godzilla vs kong and in the meantime weve been forced to endure the tv series monarch legacy of monsters which was light on scary monsters and heavy on super creepsour old favourite nuclear fusion titan godzilla has a new design with purplepinkcolored plates similar to godzilla millenniumgodzillas atomic breath is now on volume eleven after a fight with another titan that looked a hell of a lot like the one kong fights in an earlier scene and both are aquatic one fresh water the other saltwaterin the new list of titans is a mini kong named suko and hes a nasty piece of work initially but learns to love the king like audiences have since the sin japanese it roughly translates to essential child while suko is also a filipino word for surrender

expectations were relatively high after watching the trailers but came out unimpressed despite all the tickssure it is a requirement that you suspend reality when watching a movie especially when its a syfyfantasy you just enjoy the action the cg and the mayhem and destruction this has all that in buckets but does it have to jump back and forth and plenty of feeding closeups of course tickbut wait what about the plot the storyline mehwhat suckswell theres the lack of continuity the timing and duration of events the inconsistent scales of the titans from scene to scene and the amazing tidiness of the ministories to name a few tick tick tickthen theres the neatness yep its all very neat how they need this why here it is and theres that and the other neatness tickanything is posible of courseso of course there are people living in the middleearth land of titans of course there are more apes of course you can trek back to your ship past maneating plans fly back to the surface travel to where you just happen to have a giant prosthetic gauntlet for the injured kong and the correct hand fly it back and fit it before hutton finishes a sentence and of course kong will like and be able to use it in an instant why not you suspended reality before taking your seat remember big tick thattime fliesapart from the first few minutes the storyline is set to ludicrous speed and develops fast really fast illogical mindboggling events and revelations cascade so quickly that the director knows the viewer will need help which is why half the dialog is about explaining wtf just happened tick and tickdestructions galorewhere to titans like to fight in populated cities of course preferably where famous monuments can be flattened tickoverall  stars for all the ticks
"before i get rolling here i thought id mention the correct way to pronounce this movies title i was curious because godzilla x kong sounds just too awkward and since we already had godzilla vs kong a few years ago that wouldnt have made sense so here it is godzilla kong the new empire warner brothers says the x is silent so who is anyone to arguewell i dont know about anyone else but this seemed like a giant excuse to have a huge monster slugfest once these guys get going the action is relentless especially in the latter part of the movie the titled titans get to mix it up at one point but then when
a threat from hollow earth emerges to threaten the entire planet the behemoths team up to take down a serious handful of other giants with names like tiamat shar king and shimo an ice powered monster that almost took the measure of kong who received a mechanical right arm to bolster its strength after shimo hit him with its icy breath that took a lot of mentos let me tell you the amazing thing is that an adventurerdentist called trapper dan stevens conveniently had one of those huge exoskeleton arms just hanging around ready to be put to good use in case kong needed it still one would have to ask what would have happened if kong had his left arm injured instead that could have been a problemthe titanic struggles are wrapped around a story involving some human counterparts and a lost iwi tribe living in the bowels of hollow earth but lets face it thats not what you come to see the movie for its the epic action at the center of the story and on that score the film doesnt disappoint as i said its virtually nonstop belligerent action from beginning to end with both kong and godzilla making appearances in the very opening minutes of the story as a monster free for all it will leave fans breathless and clamoring for more if that were even possible"
this was better than godzilla vs kong thats for surewe got to see more of the hollow earth species such as doug the goodest boi the eel thing and shimo some titans returning from king of the monsters such as scylla and mothra who didnt die this time  as wellone nitpick i do have with the film though is the unexplained disappearance of mark and madison sure theyre pretty minor characters at this point but bernie was included in this film and mark was working to find out why godzilla was seemingly randomly attacking cities in godzilla vs kong so wouldnt he be working to find out why he was consuming energy from nuclear power plants im not saying they would have been needed in the story though maybe a reference to them would have been niceoverall a great adrenaline rush film and nice to encounter more species
godzilla x kong the new empire made me want to go back to the theaters to go and see a movie all the marketing and all the trailers compelled me to go see this and after watching it a second time in theaters i can say this movie was exactly as it was marketed a movie full of action and full of fun while the complaints about human characters this movie handled them really well and in fact had in my opinion the best human character in this entire series but the main focus is still on the monsters mostly kong still but godzilla really has his time to shine and this movie wasnt afraid to go back to those older era of godzilla films having this be a fun goofy ride of a movie
what truly sets this film apart is the emotional connection that is established with both godzilla and kong you will find yourself rooting for both creatures at different points in the film making the final battle even more intense and emotionally satisfyingthe special effects are topnotch with both godzilla and kong looking incredibly realistic and intimidating the fight sequences are epic and well choreographed showcasing the full extent of each monsters powersdirector adam wingard deserves praise for his expert direction keeping the pace brisk yet allowing for quieter characterdriven moments to shine the score complements the action beautifully heightening the tension and emotion throughoutthe film from start to finish is a rollercoaster with nonstop action the lighthearted and comicbooklike portrayal of characters makes the movie appeal to a broader audience without having to catch up with every entry in the series so farhowever the human characters take a backseat in this titancentric tale and the plot can feel a bit thin at times but who the hell needs a complex narrative when youve got kong and godzilla trading earthshattering blows the films focus on the titans origins and their bond with humankind adds a layer of depth but it might leave some viewers longing for more
just got out of a dolby cinema screening of godzilla x kong screeningman that was not very good at all boring as hell where is the gravitas by the characters from previous films in this now all of a sudden everything is a damn joke now also the plotline there was way too damn much going on and this film has completely inferior visuals compared to the previous entries👎 godzilla x kong is in my opinion nowhere near the other legendary films specifically godzilla vs kong or godzilla king of the monsterskoth is just very slightly behind gvk i loved kotm but gvk was such an experience👎 the visuals in this film at almost  of the time were not eye popping or amazing at all absolutely terrible compared to godzilla  kong skull island and nowhere near koth and gvkthe suplex looked great though 😂👎 also i remember feeling the power of godzillas charge up atomic blast in godzilla king of the monsters where was that energy in this it wasnt the same amazing charge up and godzilla supposedly had even more power with the pink atomic blast where was the power flying across the auditorium it was underwhelming as hell👎 then on to the plotlines there was way too damn much going on one of the plotlines was like kong skull island but on steroids👂🎵 another thing the score and music i liked it very much but its used so badly in the film its just sort of like background noise instead of elevating whats happening on screen🤷 also brian tyree henry has a couple of laughs but he was very underwhelming here he was absolutely hilarious in godzilla vs kong very disappointing although dan stevens and he have this particular joke together that was funny though 😂🙋rebecca hall was ok🤦🏻 and then you had all this other stuff going on just to get  crappy other monsters on screen after seeing the titan mecha godzilla and ghidorah from the  previous entries dyou think we can go back to  underwhelming monsters like these👎 also the other plotline with kong and the mini kong it was crap in my opinion it just wasnt good🤷 another thing where is the gravitas from godzilla king of monsters concerning these world ending monsters godzilla vs kong godzilla king of the monsters and godzilla minus one all were terrified of these monsters now the characters look at them like theyre little puppies or something good godwhat the hell were they thinkingthe only positives i can give this film are  the score and musicalthough used very poorly in my opinion the suplex off the top ropethats it theres nothing else good about the filmoverall this is a  outta  at very best just be glad weve watched godzilla vs kong godzilla minus one and godzilla king of the monsters in dolbyand or imax the  greatest entries in my opinion
i watched this move with  other people and we all absolutely loved it the monster fights were absolute insanity and gave me goosebumps every time the movie gave me a somewhat s vibe because of the coloration and soundtrack and the acting was quite good the chemistry between briantyreehenry and dan steven was phenomenal and the duo made me laugh every time and there were so many moments in that movie that amazed me and instead of completely focusing around the humans it mostly focused around the titans and the story of scar king and the great ape army this movie was a solid  out of  and i highly recommend you watch this this is easily one of the best monsterverse movies they have made so far and just a quick note dont listen to the people who gave the movie a low score their are few of them but they just dont enjoy life for what it is and they are generally hard to please glad there will be more monsterverse movies
"the movie is quite fun overallnegatives
the dialogue delivery left much to be desired sometimes it was too cheesy and i cringed i like having people feature heavily in these movies bc itd be difficult to relate to a bunch of monsters destroying stuff on their own but the interactions felt disjointed the science was pretty bad in this movie and the protagonist would just blurt hypothesis with zero proof on screen lol exposition isnt always the bestpositives
beautiful color palette a lot of the effects were very cool the titans all looked pretty great both design and cgi wise the different specie designs were also pretty cool the fights were good of course and engaging i loved the young ape"
in a nut shell i feel like i lost s few brain cells watching this and only gave a generous score of  to be kind to the people who worked on this hot mess spoilers after thisbetween the golom baby ape to highly inteligent animals and magically repairing roman colussium random alternating scaling of creatures there is so much that the massive fights couldnt hide one cant help think how the creatures always end up fighting or just getting by destroying around famous land marks bridges monuments the pyramids but suddenly in brazil they avoid the christ statue guess the editors figured destroying that land mark would be too offensive there is so much but i wont go on anymore people put their seat and blood into this i am sure and the studio i understand is making some money on this mindless entertainment i just cant get my mind off of the human body count in all the destroyed cities
i have no words for how immaculate this movie was my expectations were high at first and they really deliveredadam wingard really did good this time gxk was such an amazing film to watch and id definitely watch it over and over again without getting bored i have high hopes that this film will surpass the box office goalthe cgi was great humans decent writing decent vfxsfxgfx all great all the new kaijus were great sad scylla and tiamat got killed off the story was rather interesting but i loved it alloverall this film was spectacular i cant wait to see what will happen in the futurelong live the monsterverse
godzilla has been around over for years and years even since movies have been made and really even if it doesnt win any awards then if you love popcorn movies then this movie is for yousure the dialogue is corny but the acting does save the movie as the actors and actresses on what they are given here but that it is due to the fast paced action that makes up for a pretty messed up script and plotbrian tyree henry an underrated and great character actor steals the movie away having comic relief and also keeps the action going with his wit and charm as a podcast host still he would be the reason to going and seeing it
"normally when a soso sequel comes out it generally makes me want to go home and watch one of the better entries this one just caused me to want to revisit any of the godzilla films featured on mstki swear these monsterverse films get more progressively dumb as they proceed okay theyre dumbfun justnot that much fun anymoreexcluding entry  kong skull island and the  fantastic apple tv series monarch legacy of monsters each chapter sinks deeper and deeper into the middle earth of realism they might as well just animate these movies since theyre so far from reality and the stakes couldnt be lowergodzilla x kong the new empire begs you to leave your brain at the door basically theres a new old threat to both of the title characters and the bad boys bad boys what are they gonna do allbut highfive and fight duhi wouldnt go as far to say this movies badif you dont take it seriously for one minute its also not a sobaditsgood its just there for those who want to see big monsters fightadmittedly my expectations couldnt be lower namely when baby kong showed up in the trailers and he looked like he crawled right out of a super nintendo spoiler his graphics didnt improve in the final product and by far was the worst cgi in the entire franchise so the movie could literally go only up from what i predicted and it didmostly any kong scene was worthy of a watch and mind you not when any human did something to him  i only mean when he was away from all humans and on his own adventuresfunny i grew up on godzilla movies and loved them as a kid i couldnt get enough and while i respected king kong and loved his three standalone movies from   and  forgetting all the other sequelscrossovers godzilla was my jam in this monsterverse its the opposite kong is definitely king throughoutluckily i was able to separate my recent love and awe for godzilla minus one when i watched this latest king of the monsters film yes theyre from separate universes but comparing them is like asking which is better bram stokers dracula and abraham lincoln vampire hunter or bride of frankenstein and i frankenstein you know ones great and the other sillywhile this ranks deadlast in the monsterverse see below its still worthy of a watch its harmless and may even develop into a drinking game every time you have to say to yourself yeah right or really seriouslyfinal thoughts my monsterverse ranking kong skull island

"the more they increase these monsters intelligence the more they insult the intelligence of adult human audiences keep the middle way make it neither childish nor too complex this one was leaned more towards childish level dont get me wrong i loved the actions and alliances but i believe the writers can do better than that in setting up the ways they achieve alliances between certain monstersmy personal monsterverse rating
godzilla   worthy godzilla reboot
kong skull island   worthy kong reboot
godzilla king of monsters   great villain monster
godzilla vs kong   unfortunately the start of of too much fantasy the way the monster skull possessing the mech suit megagodzilla come on
godzilla x kong the new empire   too humanlike interaction between monsters too much fantasy but great action scenes"
"this is my first ever review here so bear with me im gonna try and keep it shortfirst of at all even the very beginning of the movie was like a blurry mess im sure theyre pretty talented people but looks like the vfx team who worked on this project forced to shorten their rendering times even at the very start of the movie cgi is bad and nothing near the past godzilla and kong movies from the hollywood couldve been much much better than this this one is the least watchable when compared with the others i dont think ill ever rewatch it again not enough lively details with the cgi not looking realistic enough also the bigness of the characters doesnt feel majestic enough on their surroundings something doesnt right about their proportions and movements as wellright until seeing this movie i was like hollywood is absolutely doing godzilla movies better than the japan since i liked the godzilla  more than the godzilla minus one  but oh boy i got sucker punched good with this oneoh and also lots of irrelevant s music and neon colors all over the movie i mean guys please it wasnt like this even with the ones with millie bobby brown present with her stranger things background  this is pretty much why i decided to write thor love and thunder on the headline of my review btw that one also was overcolorful just like this one and also fell down the expectationsmy  centsstory was not that bad somehow acceptable but its practice was done wrong at times needs some rewrites reshoots and rerenders to be goldenits not a bad one time watch if youre able to trick your brain into reimagining what youre seeing at the exact moment of youre seeing it and fill the gaps with your imagination 
i mean if you can accept how the cgi looks and if youre also into s music and neon colors like i doi dont think this qualify as a spoiler since it can be clearly seen on the poster but if youre sensitive and not even checked out the poster yet please stop reading right around hereit was sad to see that the king is pink maybe they couldve gone with the red instead you know since no monster is scary in pinkfelt like im watching an ad a beverage ad dragon fruit flavored an energy drink brands and it was more of a kong movie than the godzilla x kong they shouldve named it mostly kong x partly godzilla and not even write the godzilla firstthank you you read it allthat sure shows character you are a red godzilla rawr "
all this kong thing i think is about time the end game comes like theres no threat real enough to even call forth the formidable godzilla even when its a tag team battle if they continue in this direction eventually it would result in a flop and that could be catastrophic for even we the fans scenes that took my breath away were included and thats amazing but i bet so many have had enoughof this godzilla and kong thing dont get me started on the fact that a kung fu fighting monkey or gorilla took form in arms in a whip that he uses i mean who taught him how to fight like that coming from humble beginnings you can tell the story evolved but now its heading somewhere different great entertainment though but other than that ehh nothing comes to mind
to start my review yes i have seen all of the previous movies leading up to this piece of sand yes i have enjoyed those previous filmsthis movie is a letdown on multiple frontsim just going to sum it up in bulletpoints no need to write too much to make my pointit tries to be funny but fails miserably to land any joke or puncgi is sloppy when you have too much monsters that means too much cgi which means budget has to be dividedresult fake looking actionthe actions scenes are not involving at all looks stupid does not take you into itwhen huge monsters as kong or godzilla roar you dont hear anything yet when they walk the sounds trembles enormously reason the music on these moments is waaaay to loudit is just dumb so dumbyou can get away with it when all of the above points are no issue when they are the movie failswhich it didreally disappointing
godzilla vs kong starts off strong with an engaging first half that really pulls you into the story however some might find the pacing a bit slow at times especially in the buildup to the action scenes speaking of action the battles between godzilla and kong are jawdropping especially in the first half but as the movie progresses it feels like theres something missing in terms of the storys substance and unfortunately the climax didnt quite deliver the epic finale that many were hoping for overall its a fun movie to watch once especially if youre a fan of monster flicks but it might not have enough depth to keep you coming back for more
my  year old son likes these movies and comics so hes been excited to see iti was looking forward to it aswell until i started seeing the bad reviews etcwell what can i say yes it utterly ridiculous all over the place plot holes centralbut its a movie about giant ancient creatures and worlds under ours so come ongo in with an open mind and forget the absurdity and the convenient bionic arm that happens to be a flying ship that can also cure frost bite hmm haalso the main villain i actually did find the scenes there pretty scary and dark very planet of the apes in tone but obviously not as goodmy son loved it and we had a good laugh about it afterwards enjoyable
this new entry into the monsterverse saga delves further into the histories of godzilla and kong their origins and the mysteries of skull island and beyondand lets not forget that the film also tries uncover the mythic battle that helped forge these extraordinary beings and what tied them to humankind foreveri always want to give the monsterverse the benefit of the doubt because they brought about a new cinematic universe without telling anybody about itbut unfortunately the quality of the films have been steadily dropping and this has to be the worst of the franchise and im astounded by all of the positive reviews and box office that this has receivedyes the effects are amazing and thats the only positive thing i have to say about this the film makes no sense and whatever story this film pretends to have it gets lost in a sea of cgi and battlesthe battles are boring and amount to nothing and the human cast are given nothing to do aside from going to location after location and spouting out exposition to keep reminding the audience that this is supposed to have some sort of narrative flowbut its going to have a sequel and i really hope that one is better than thisa dud
trust me the best monsterverse movie the director exactly knew what audience were paying for and it was brilliantly executed the humans tale less screentime than the monsters and the entry of martha was epic the fights which we all anticipated and the team up of godzilla and kong against scar king and shimu is meant to be watched in the biggest screen possible go for the movie rather waiting for ott you will definitely regret for not watching in a big screenthe director exactly knew what audience were paying for and it was brilliantly executed the humans tale less screentime than the monsters and the entry of martha was epic the fights which we all anticipated and the team up of godzilla and kong against scar king and shimu is meant to be watched in the biggest screen possible go for the movie rather waiting for ott you will definitely regret for not watching in a big screen
godzilla vs kong the new empire is the latest film in the monsterverse cinematic world which is a continuation of the previous film where godzilla and kong work together to destroy a very large threatso far  reviews have been published on the website rotten tomatoes for the movie godzilla vs kong the new empire giving it a score of  on the metacritic site out of  reviews published for this film a score of  out of  has been recorded for itbut it is not a small compliment if we say that the movie godzilla vs kong the new empire is a skillful and fascinating work
the show is utterly nonsensical wasted my entire  mins or so a show with hardly a storyline to begin with  parts which i can share sorry spoiler alert but im gonna save you some money and you are gonna thank me st a mechanical arm which was premade how the heaven did they predict that kong will be frostbite his right arm  the show is also telling you that there are multiple titans leaving here and there and godzilla only killed them when he sensed a signal rd the show is trying to tell you that there are iwi tribe leaving in the hollow world for god knows how long and no one found out and out of a sudden all those monkeys suddenly storming into it
i for one appreciate the script on this one or a lack of but still glad i didnt watch this on theatersthe constant primal rage battles with over the top cinematics and relentless action and more importantly a small little human moment while maintaining little presence throughout the film theres so little dialogue you could choose random points in the movie with a high probability of no one talking they almost got it perfectly this time too buy theres always that one outofplace character that feels annoying and distractingand sadly it still require you to shutoff your brain as almost everything that happens is so too disconnected from reality and lacking in logical explanations but this is a monster mash and it does so very well you can leave the more human and scientific storytelling to toho whom are perfectly content with telling the same story as many times as possible fun and it moves rather fast so it is easy to watch and the great cgi helps too
these godzilla and king kong movies always get a mixed reaction out of me on the one hand of this movie feels like a quick monster movie that you can watch with anybody on the other hand this felt like a wasted potential regarding the premise of this movie and for my recent watching of godzilla minus one imma a just be a mixed bag with this movie the visuals are actually pretty nice and pretty dope to look at especially when you look at the monsters there are some scenes with kong that feels like you can see the cgi but on the other hand on godzilla and on the other monkeys it actually looks pretty damn cool one thing that actually irritated me was the human plot line now you can do humans really well just like godzilla mine is one but in this movie kind of feels generic theres always a group of people that kinda dont make sense to be around except for the little girl and the mother other than that there are other people that dont have no personal motivations especially the funny one and the one character that fixed kong tooth they dont have real motivations or real personal goals that they want to achieve and thats another waste of potential in my opinion the villain scar king he was pretty cool but i feel like its a little step down because in godzilla versus king kong theyre actually cool personal motivations regarding the corporation of mega godzilla and why they want to replace godzilla but scar king in my opinion does not have any personal motivation or no point of view that we as an audience can look through the certain story elements was kind of intriguing like kong and the underworld i forgot what name they called it but that was wasted potential to me because they couldve went somewhere with kong being alone and being the only one but its revealed that hes not the only one he has to deal with trying to become king and another thing that kind of bother me was godzilla the reason godzilla bother me was because we barely got to see godzilla and godzilla and king kong movie in my opinion godzilla was the highlight of the show because he was jumping body slamming and doing all sorts of stuff king kong was cool but you have to be equal if their characters names in the title overall this is a mixed reaction it was not bad its not kind of good but its just not to the point where made as in a bad movie but as mid as in action just to pass the time but this movie was not bad at all 
godzilla x kong is good fun no where near being as good as godzilla minus one but better then i remember godzilla vs kong beingall the human characters i dont remember from the previous films and wont remember again from this exist either to read exposition off a wall or deliver exposition they couldnt possibly know in order to explain why the big monsters are kicking seven kinds of ahem out of each other one is there to give us a bit of mystical woo woo and why notkong is basically the star of the movie which is how it should be most of the action is well done and whilst there are bits where the cgi is a bit well cgi mostly its good and there are some truly stunning visuals the big battle at the end with lots of monsters smashing seven bells out of each other is a bit all over the place so you often cant tell whos biting who but hey weve all had nights like thatfar from essential but you could do worse on a cold bank holiday afternoon
sure the special effects sound designs camerawork and thrills are there and there are some good visual spectacles and fights that are wellexecuted the performances from the cast members are solid as well however i found myself just feeling that the story action concepts and the characters not being interesting or as creativity as it thinks and just like the american godzilla movies except  one they really miss the point of what makes godzilla specialadam wingard is a talented director but his direction just continues to disappoint and disappoint the characters are dull including some really laughably dialogue and the pacing is pretty off some of the action moments are okay but thats about it and at times it was a bit boring making a godzilla movie boring should be a crime against humanity
a very beautiful looking movie with fantastic action sequences im amazed everyone looks amazing kong baby kong godzilla and the evil monkeythe humans like always are kinda boring a mute girl a otaku the typical short hair girl and some kind of animal dentist the girl and the vet are an ex couple nobody cares about that to be honestthe final fight its incredible everything else its generic so thats everything i have to say there is cameo but im not ruining the surprise for you overall thats all happy thanksgiving everyone goodbay and good night watch this movie guys just watch it ok
ill get right to the point this is the nd worst godzilla flic since godzilla  as usual legendary manages to make even the charactorsactors with the greatest potential and in their usual fashion turns them into cardboad not even the semiclever quips work to give these characters a heart kaylee hottle is very talented and the poor script manages to snuff out her true potential same for dan stevens who has the potential to do great things but again the script is so trite he is lost in the murk the other cast members did a phonein performance that a high schooler could have donemaybe even better as far as the cgi over utilized and a quality that pales in comparison to minus  kong and minikong had rediculous facial expressions and the fight scenes between them looked like www wrestling match with all the correographed moves if it wasnt so rediculous and disappointing it would be hilarious in fact audience was actually laughing at times legendary you cant seem to do justice to these iconic charactors because the people you use to write direct and produce dont understand them so please stop trying dan stevens you have done great work in the past please dont sell out to this garbage
this was a great movie im baffled by all the low ratings perhaps people thought this was where self assessments are posted graphics were good adventure good story line for character development good fight scenes were good and music score good i personally like the emotional and facial expressions expressed with kong and the other monkies  perhaps this is where other people got lostif you are still reading after this just know that it is cheap filler as you have to type at least  words to leave a review so anyway dont believe the tasteless naysayers this movie was dope
was it godfatherlevel  no was i grinning like an idiot saying wow out loud and fistbumping my son throughout yes this is what i expect for my money a literal bang for my buckspoilers obviouslystuff i liked off the top of my headmini kong was weird and creepy in the beginning but i grew to love him i couldnt believe kong used him as a weaponthe fight in egypt was incredible poor pyramids the one in brazil was almost as goodthe multiple locations around the world made it feel like a bond moviei liked all the human characters especially the grumpy scottish pilot and bernie hayes the girl jia was good as alwaysthe fights were pretty brutal starting from the first minutes of the moviethere are long sections of the movie where titans and other creatures are communicating without words but you understand everything theyre saying often reminded me of a planet of the apes moviethe music was spoton and rocked throughoutnot too many talky exposition scenesthis movie does ice threat well which ghostbusters frozen empire didnt quite managemothra my favourite titandidnt likethere must be thousands or hundred of thousands of people dead in rio after the rampage there r i poverall very happy to have seen this definitely catch it in theatres although i had to stand up and tell some douchebag a few rows down from me to stop filming the movie on her phone
firstly please refrain from comparing this to the japanese release of godzilla the same year while i also enjoyed that film this side of the pacific ocean offers a completely different experiencenow lets dive into the reviewthe storyline back in the days was quite simple a blonde ventures into a jungle where a giant gorilla falls in love the climax involves the gorilla climbing a tall building in the city before meeting his deaththen out of nowhere godzilla emerges with a theory suggesting he was sleeping in an oceanic space subsequently other monsters surface all nourished by nuclear energy leading to the expected chain of eventsa new twist arises with the discovery of another jungle during world war ii revealing the existence of the colossal kong as the plot unfolds we learn that the deep ocean isnt the only habitat for these creatures there are hidden portals and even a whole earth within earthmoving forward the film delves into the hollow earth theory unveiling yet another layer of secrecy within this subterranean realm to uncover the details of this hidden place youll have to watch the moviein an unexpected turn godzilla adopts a seemingly invincible persona to confront a formidable adversary while kong who i suspect might start conversing in the next installment receives an iron manlike upgradeultimately the movie is pure entertainment despite any negative criticism it keeps you engaged throughout ensuring you wont be bored so give it a watch and the above will all make sense
if you want to see an empire fall keep making potentially epic movies like godzilla x kong into silly drivelas a big fan of s godzilla im quite disappointed with this latest monsterverse installment im angry at the direction they went with this movie its gone the way of too many franchises such as fast  furious and transformers where the filmmakers have stopped taking it seriously id rather they just not make the movie than make a joke out of it its such a trivial forgettable cheesy experience the new empire has the tone and style of a kids movie the characters are silly and shallow the sets look cheap the cgi is mediocre and most of the humor falls well below the intellectual level of an adult it cant even be called good escapism because so much about it is unconvincingif nothing else this should have been visually thrilling rather the monster fight sequences look like something on the level of those corny power rangers shows i watched growing up its so chaotic and looks so fake the directer clearly had no idea what people want to see from such a movie i remember watching s godzilla and getting goosebumps as they so expertly portrayed the power and scale of godzilla not once during the new empire did i think these creatures look awesome i wanted to feel overwhelmed by their presence but the filmmakers paid no mind to that they might as well have been human sized creatures fighting each otherit terms of story they tried to do way to much it got to the point where it felt like they were throwing something new in every  minutes this is definitely an example of quantity over quality even if the runtime were as long as peter jacksons king kong from  it wouldnt have been long enough to make all of this workone of the biggest crimes this movie commits is it makes godzilla an unnecessary character i love godzilla but here hes a side character whos only in the movie to get more viewers to the theater the new empire would have been much better if it cut out all the other kaiju and focused on kong and the primary ape villain who ends up getting a much smaller role than expectedim someone who has a soft spot for familyfriendly adventurefantasy films and i couldnt even get with this movie while most of it is watchable the ridiculousness of the last act completely turned me off
godzilla x kong the new empire is one crazy movie i mean its completely offthewall the things that go on in this movie have to be seen to be believed dont try to guess what will happen next while watching this movie it just keeps throwing one more outlandish development after another that said when the monsters are fighting the new empire is great stuff the monsters are hard to resist as far as the human cast goes they have a very hard job competing the standout of this movie as far as the humans go is brian tyree henry godzilla x kong the new empire isnt my favorite movie of the series but i enjoyed the craziness i saw this at amc roosevelt field ny
godzilla vs kong the new empire reignites the ageold clash of titans yet this battle feels more like a tired repetition than a fresh evolution were thrust into a world where godzilla and kong begrudgingly team up to safeguard humanity from lurking threats however whispers of an imminent danger soon shatter this fragile alliance plunging our ape and atomic behemoth into a struggle for survivalthe films standout feature lies in its stunning visual spectacle the epic clashes between godzilla and kong are nothing short of aweinspiring director adam wingard orchestrates these confrontations with a frenzied vigor whisking us from the neonlit streets of hong kong to the gravitydefying depths of hollow earth the visual effects are impeccable meticulously crafting both monsters with breathtaking detail godzillas atomic fury illuminates the screen while kong maneuvers with a graceful agility that defies his colossal statureyet despite the visual splendor the film falters in its storytelling the narrative feels pieced together relying heavily on tired tropes and predictable plot twists once again human characters are relegated to mere bystanders in the monster spectacle given scant development or depth although attempts are made to forge a bond between kong and a newfound ape ally in hollow earth it feels shallow and inconsequential moreover lackluster dialogue and clichéd motivations do little to engage viewers in their plightthe pacing exacerbates the films shortcomings oscillating between sluggish exposition and frenetic action sequences at times the editing feels disjointed marring the clarity of the fight choreography while tom holkenborgs score delivers some adrenalinepumping tracks for the battles it lacks the thematic resonance or memorable melodies that elevate a monster moviein essence godzilla vs kong the new empire falls short of its potential while it may offer fleeting enjoyment for kaiju enthusiasts craving bigbudget showdowns it ultimately disappoints with its forgettable narrative underdeveloped characters and uneven execution for those seeking a monster movie masterpiece this iteration is best left stranded on skull island
my live reaction  review for godzilla x kong  the new empire  kong has a cool new weapon there must be a new threat at first i thought what a cute small monkey but then it attacked kong who are these monkeys they got a trap for kong thats not good hollow earth looks beautiful is it me or the movie focuses too much on people i dont like that kong and the aggressive little monkey became friends i didnt see that coming it took them one hour to find the main villain thats a bit late skar king vs kong lets go what is this huge monster it looks like godzilla but it is not godzilla pretty cool skar king sent his apes to kill kong cant he do it himself what a coward kong with his new mechanical hand looks badass mothra and kong and godzilla vs skar king and shimo this is good the last fight scene was pretty satisfying ok overall the movie is not bad but also it isnt great my rating is 
the completely exagerrated human behaviour of kong and that little monkey alone so that even the dumbest viewer can follow this nonsense is embarrasing not to forget the nonperformance of all human actors including the wild tribe inside of hollow hollow earth why not just make the movie without any of them it couldnt have done any harm then the titans woudl have even more time to fight their royal rumble nice wrestling move from godzila to kong at the pyramids by the way the crowning glory project powerhouse of course exactly for the arm that poor kong has injured and of course stored in the outpost nearby lord let it rain brains
amazing imax d experience powerful vrxgood story line movie never slow downboth characters kong and godzilla were amazing  action was at its best plus other characters from previous movie and continuity keep going but one thing  too much violence if you are planning to go with your younger kids but i think it is entertaining for them too in a big waybut if you have watched part one or read the story it will be little help toothis movie is made for imax experience so best to watch in imax theatre and in d movie direction production everything is upto markand all the actors performed well enjoy the show cheers
it is when you make further equations of kong and now also godzilla et co and some other new raising creatures and of course the dumbest of them all is in my opinion in this complete fantasy world green screen and bluescreen produced movie the humans what a horrible script what a horrible cast and what a horrible work from the cast except maybe dan stevens its just terrifying to have to watch a grand cast doing so little in a sophisticatedly horrendously baldly scripted movie that an average grumpy old norwegian man has to pay almost  nok to watch at the movietheater  getting my from before blasted ears reblasted by the soundlevel and effects no no use your sparetime in fresh air and study life around you its better than this let them humans out of the play at next productionpoint they make me feel dum 
i feel like weve reached a point in the monsterverse where writers just gave up on pretending theres some story with the movies and just embraced the lowquality cgi bonanza that has increasingly dominated the series yet they still manage to introduce one of the most bizarre senseless and irrelevant cast of characters with no background story no personality no nothing and for how long will brian tyree henry always doing his best version of brian tyree henry spoil every single random movie so incredibly annoying and unnecessary not funny at all and just also whats going on with the outofnowhere peterquillmeetsryanreynoldsplaysssong character oh boy
godzilla x kong the new empire understands exactly what this monsterverse should be better than any other instalment so far both the stupidity and sheer scale are taken to new heights whilst finally putting the titans front and centre it proves that giant monsters fighting will never get old and is ridiculously entertainingfixing one of the most common problems with these films the human cast is massively trimmed down to only the necessities here rebecca hall is given more to work with brian tyree henry is a funnier comic relief and dan stevens is having so much fun and looking cool doing itthe best performance goes to kong though which is a testament to incredibly detailed vfx work on display here the cg is able to convey his anguish at his loneliness yearning to find his people and any pain he endures it really shows that humans arent needed in these films as kong can convey all the necessary emotions and most importantly without dialogueadam wingards direction has gotten stronger in comparison to the last one the sense of scale is completely lost at this point but in its place are big monster fights that feel like someone smashing toys together in the best ways theres several sequences where the titans move the story forward all on their own which are always the best partthe music by tom holkenborg and antonio di lorio really doubles down on the s scifi vibes with even more synth than last time when its accompanying a zero gravity fight at the centre of the earth it helps to turn the whole thing into the biggest saturday morning cartoon ever made
besides the fact that the main actress now has short hair so instead of a spectacular feminine river flow she looks like a seashore dike and probably fits hws desire to make genders fluid and confuse people and besides turning masculine african americans into whiners jokingly saying things to other guys such as i would kiss you on your mouth or turning godzilla the king of monsters purple it was a watchable movie obviously you cannot expect any deep story as it is meant to be a movie where giant monsters are beating the heck out of each otherthe jokes were unfunny too as hw keeps repeating the same formula to the point that it has simply become unbearable none of the jokes even managed to make me smile let alone laughbut overall it was a watchable movie with lots of fights between monsters decent visuals and special effects and acceptable story
movies about king kong and godzilla have been out for almost  years of course and have been entertaining the audience a lot all this time with the arrival of godzilla in  a new monsterverse was created in which there was slow work towards the meeting of the giant monkey king kong and the nuclear lizard godzilla now i have to be honest and the series didnt get any better because after godzilla from  and kong skull island from  in  we got the terribly bad godzilla king of monsters and its successor godzilla vs kong from  didnt get much better on that at the outcome of the trailer you already know in advance that this is going to be a cgi festival just like its predecessors it was recently a relief to be able to see the japanese godzilla minus one but you already know in advance that this should not even be in the shadow of that film then why still visit this movie well i love monster movies anyway and im always curious what people have made of it again so with fear and trake i look forward to this film againthe story is really too stupid for words although the story is a lot better than godzilla king of the monsters from  which really didnt have a story in it it actually occurs from the beginning when kong turns out to have a toothache once to the normal world a plane thing is pulled kongs molar yes that level indeed the film continues and one is taken to the portals to hollow earth across the world where monarch keeps an eye on the titans meanwhile godzilla sleeps in the italian colosseum in rome kong gets it up against a number of other monkeys from hollow earth and comes across a small monkey there eventually covering the dreaded scar king you already hear it for the story you dont have to go to the movie and a lot really makes no sense at all ilene andrews is a researcher at monarch and has taken jia of skull island one of the last survivors of her tribe under her care why she comes to the blogger bernie hayes who is extremely paranoid is really still a big mystery this character really adds absolutely nothing to the story and that is quite clever when you consider that this is one of the main characters from the storywhatever was feared for godzilla x kong has become a cgi festival large parts of the movie you are wondering if you didnt end up in the wrong room because it looks like a disney pixar movie of course there is little to complain about the cgi effects its all quite beautifully made the director on duty also focuses very much on the use of color in the film and works with quite a few lens flares probably to amplify the d version of the film a bit towards the end the film goes wild and the titans end up in egypt and brazil where everything has to be broken it is the most entertaining part of the film as the throwing and throwing work and the destruction of entire buildings are incessantly brought to the screen sometimes it seems as if the creators have played a lot of a loan at the transformers films and at the planet of the apes films godzilla plays a relatively small role in the film and is eventually only covered for the last half hour for the rest the film might as well have been called kong hollow earth because the story is actually largely about the big cgi monkeygodzilla x kong the new empire has become a mediocre job where the story is really very bad the action and effects are fine and in that regard time flies by what is the addition of certain characters in the film remains a big mystery and large parts of the story really make no sense at all the last half hour maybe its forty minutes are the most entertaining where everything has to be broken and the battle of the titans is unleashed where with most films the d effect does not really have added value it is the case with this film especially the use of bright colors and the lens fares and of course the excessive use of cgi let you take you in d into a world ruled by monsters for the rest the film is really nothing special and when the credits start rolling you are actually wondering what you should think of this one thing is for sure its  better than godzilla king of the monsters but a bit like godzilla vs kong
godzilla and kong movies are fun to watch and this new installment was entertaining for me it was more detailed and entertaining than godzilla vs kong though its screenplay could have been more tightthe story was same like every godzilla kong movie where new villian monster arrives but its execution was decent the screenplay as said earlier could have been more tight the direction was good the performances by the cast members were decent and the cgi vfx were brilliantoverall watch this movie with less or no expectations and you will surely enjoy it also try to watch it in cinemas
godzilla vs kong the new empire is like a rollercoaster ride of epic proportions visually its a feast for the eyes with mindblowing vfx thatll leave you in awe youll definitely get those goosebumps moments especially with the characters and some scenes that just hit differently but lets be real the first half kinda feels like its stuck in neutral especially when they dive into the whole hollow earth thing and dont even get me started on the climaxits like they hit fast forward and left us hanging the characters are badass no doubt but they kinda get lost in the shuffle so yeah its a solid flick but it couldve been a whole lot better
appreciate the cgi action sequencesapart from that this film has a lot of thing that i didnt likethe plot storyi always believed that in films plot and story are the important things you should have its the fundamentals i think you can agree with thatin this film most of what happens here is just ridiculous you understand when you see the filmhuman characterskaiju movies yes but that doesnt mean we dont need to have a good human characterin gxk i dont see a person that are actually smart important and professional enough to deal with this titansdisappointing villainscar king turns out he wasnt intimidating at all i expect more from himthats my opinion
ill admit its easier to watch then gvk has less corny humor in this one and had a huge s retro music vibe to ithowever the plot is very basic and all the interactions involving humans is just side story nothing elseto sum up the plot kong moves to a new neighborhood no one knows him or fears him meets the bully of said neighborhood bully has his own version of godzilla fight does not go well for kong kong then needs help of a rd party to convince godzilla to help him take down the bully godzilla kills a few other monsters to absorb enough nuclear energy to help kong beat the bully
watched this with my son in imax d and wow this is the first time i have watched a movie in d imax and what a movie this was to experience it blows away standard d and the sound was incredible the movie itself had a good story line  a couple laughs along the way if you watched the tv show monarch legacy of monsters you can see how that sort of ties in i would  recommend seeing this in imax d you will not be disappointed the effects are amazing and if you like the monster universe movies like i do then you are going to love this a little tip do not wait around for anything during of after the end credits there is nothing to see
the action scenes were more exciting and cooler visually the characters had humor which was missing in the previous movie there was too much story though kong is being attacked by other apes and an ice dinosaur in skull island while the survivors from the first movie go to skull island in hopes of having him stop godzilla from destroying various parts of asia and europe then they find in a cave with hieroglyphics that a creature who can make peace is the mothra and must be summoned oddly the creatures find each other in egypt even though they dont know anything about geography and were countries apart
i went into this movie with a somewhat hopefulness that it would be enjoyable and some parts were while other parts really were just a drag i dont know about anyone else but the little girl just bothered me just like she did in godzilla vs kong her constantly looking like shes about to cry got old really quick and then to find out shes the expected savior from skull island foretold in ancient carvings omg how many times is this boring trope gonna be usedbernie was honestly a useless character after he figured out it was a distress signal he provided no useful information or development of the story he was intended as comic relief and just wasnt funnyoh and how convenient that the abandoned project that would extra arm kong just happened to be in the hollow world all this time yawnone big plus about the movie though no millie bobbie brown
this movie is exceptionally good people are getting bored from marvel and dceu who always does repetitive things but monsterverse adds new flavour to the action scenes and godzilla×kong truly delivered to itthe fight scenes are amazing and when the monsters are on the screen you will never be bored the one problem which was with godzilla vs kong was that the story wasnt well written but this time adam wingard produced a well written storya must watch movie but i think it should be watched in d to gain maximum reward for the money you paid and its truly worth ittruly a blockbuster 🔥😍😍
godzilla vs kong is a decent movie falling somewhere between bad and great going in i tempered my expectations avoiding comparisons to the masterpiece that is godzilla minus one for the most part this film holds up well thanks largely to kong and his young companion i believe he was called suko these characters possess more depth than the bland forgettable humans who tend to dull down the narrative the main leads contribute little of significance aside from the occasional exposition dumps none of them leave a lasting impressiongodzillas limited screen time is another issue he appears to cause chaos and then disappears for extended periods personally i still regard the  godzilla as the best iteration in the legendary universe i miss the weighty deliberate movements and raw power he once possessed here he moves with the speed of a bullet bordering on cartoonish at times however i tried not to let this detract from the enjoyment as the film isnt meant to be taken too seriously its a silly overthetop monster flick featuring spectacular battle sequences the cgi is nearly flawless throughout with only a few minor hiccups here and there the musical score while not quite on par with king of monsters is still commendablethe villain known as the scar king is intriguing but sadly underutilized personally i would have preferred less focus on the human storyline and more exploration of his character and his oppressed society this could have elevated the film significantlyin conclusion godzilla vs kong is an entertaining watch while it may not achieve the same legendary status as minus one its certainly good enough to keep audiences entertainedrating 
"if i want to see a superhero movie i would watch avengers or justice league but not godzilla vs kong
the monsterverse had potential but after godzilla vs kong  they made a cinematic universe with great potential in nothing they lost everything for me like i couldnt make a better story but never in my life i would give kong the powers from thor like the b e a s t glove conducts electricity and then the ax that just a movie ago was the best thing in this world and now it was almost nothingand also change godzillas iconic color to pink 😭
but not to mention the monsters which im still going to talk about the story isnt very good either like them going to the hollow earth is cool but now explain
what were scar kings slaves doing they couldnt leave that place
i couldnt go to the surface they were just moving rocks from one side to the other
and then the name of the film godzilla x kong the new empire like i even understand new empire because of the ending where p kong took scar kings place but the part about godzilla x kongtheir fight lasted like  minutes
i personally didnt like it very much its just another cliché monster movienow the villains
sacr king isnt even some kind of final boss hes just someone who enslaves monkeys in the hollow earth
and shimos look looks like its made of plastic i wouldnt do any better because i dont even know how to work with animations or d objects but whoever made monster zero mechagodzilla and skullcrawler were all very wellcrafted antagonists and why did she end up looking like a kongs kind of dogthe best part of this film is sko and the humans who were still horrible
even my favorite character godzilla just slept for more than half the film and in the end he did almost nothing mothra might as well
who by the way also did almost nothing"
i went into it without much expectation and that saved me most of the pain but not all as this was a very slightly above average film with some decent and terrible cgi monsters bashing one another with a story shoved in between however most of the cgi is good the bad is just at the start of the film with the first battle if you can call it that the story is outlandish but works for plot sake and the humans arent too annoying at least kong is quite good in this film similar to kong vs godzilla he is the main kaiju in this film whilst godzilla is at the sidelines which was a shame the battles in the film go by way to quickly and dont have much substance to them which is annoying as in previous films such as k vs g and gkotm have shown they can have great kaiju battles with cool choreography i really wanted to love this film like others but just cant when i can clearly see better films within the monsterverse such as the examples before its clear that they didnt put enough money into cgi production as some scenes look bad or not as good as others and the battles scenes are just not that good you can have fun with the film of course as i did when i was watching it but after youre done you realise the potential it had and that makes you depressed it does give me hope that the future of the monsterverse is more kaiju focused than human focused as kongs journey in the film was really interesting and at this point the audience has grown attached to him over the past two movies hes been in previously this is a  film depending on how generous you are on the day
godzilla x kong the new empire is not a perfect film but for a blockbuster it delivers on the pure monster action it promisesoftentimes in monster features you tend to get a massive amount of human character scenes and very little monster sequences as an attempt to build up tension however this film gives the viewer a lot of monster focused content which was actually quite refreshing in particular i really enjoyed kongs major scene and how they chose to have no human characters explaining what is going on instead they allow the audience to look at the body language to interpret what is going on it was definitely my favourite partalthough the human sequences in this bring it down a little the first half an hour is a lot of exposition on what has happened in previous films and how characters relate to each other furthermore some of the films cgi needed more work for such a cgi heavy film the computer generated effects need to be as good as possible i do recommend seeing this if you are a fan of monster action type films you will get a massive amount of fun creature clashes
the monsterverse movies in the past decade have mainly focused on godzilla and kong in the newly released godzilla x kong the new empire they are forced to team up with each other yet again to fight a dangerous threat if you have your brain on at all while watching this movie you will think its very bad in the past ive wanted them to give the human characters better writing so i could care about them after watching this i have changed my mind if they make another one simply take out the humans all together watching certain scenes made me realize that they dont need dialogue to move the story forward the only reason humans have to be in this is to spoonfeed exposition to the audience making it seem like were stupid if they fully focus on godzilla and kong in this new empire it could be a very interesting movie in this world godzilla has nothing to do except build up his power while kong is dealing with the new threat down on hollow earth dont get me started on that now that ive gotten that off my chest turning my brain off during this experience i really enjoyed the monsters beating the crap out of other monsters the fight scenes are some of the best to come out of this frankly tepid universe of movies this one had the potential to have great human relationship moments and even a great monster relationship but it just kept flying to the next thing the only human i did enjoy was trapper dan stevens the monster veterinarian he was hilarious if you enjoy monster fights i recommend godzilla x kong the new empire
ok it goes like this girl who is last of her tribe and also deaf stop stop right there when a story starts like this you know the rest of it is going to be a miserable predictable watch as it turns out thats exactly what ensues not the fun kind of predictable that you might be hoping for the kind of low quality predictability that requires me to hunt for nearly random word to even finish this review on top of that the cgi is lazy and looks like something youd see in a five dollar video game if your choice is between watching drool slide down a friends face or watching this then definitely choose the drool at least youll have something to laugh at with that friend in years to come
i enjoyed godzilla x kong i thought they did a great job with the monster fights and even the story between the monsters to me they used the humans to explain the narrative that the monster couldnt trapper and bernie that kept the human story from being completely boring scar king is good villian how he struck fear in the other kongs glad to see the introduction of other monsters and seeing both kong and godzilla have battles with them i am a big godzilla fan and i always would like to see more of him even though he didnt have as much screen time as kong when he was on screen i appreciate how he was used i liked what they did with kongs story and the visuals of hollow earth are great
godzilla x kong the new empire is the th film in warners bros monsterverse and like all of them does a solid job of making giant titanskaiju fight with a bit of a storyline holding it together returning are dr andrews hall head of the titanwatch company her adopted daughter jia hottle and bernie henry the comedic relief the new addition is trapper stevens the vet the plot is mostly kongcentric now that he lives in hollow earth and godzillas on the surfacekong finds another part of hollow earth best not to ask too many questions as physics went out the window a long time ago in these films that has other apes and titans setting in motion a big battle with the scar king a giant orangutan this necessitates a semiforced teamup with godzilla with the help of an unexpected titan theres some time spent on jias journey but not too much that you get bored of the humansas always the cgi is pretty good and kong has more empathy than some human actors godzilla still looks great  and gets his pink plates upgrade when theyre fighting each other or different titans its always pretty impressive to see nothing crazily spectacular here but nor is it boring or excessively dumb good se of kiss i was made for loving you
ill start by saying that nobody who goes to watch godzilla x kong really cares about whats going on in the movie were there to see monsters fight and anything else unless compelling is filler to be ignored if all youre looking for are monster fights theres plenty of them here and theyre decent too  both the visuals and the action sadly everything else is so silly that its almost self aware of its silliness its an undeniable step down from the first which in itself wasnt anything too special and while promising at first with kong finding his place in hollow earth it soon becomes a nothing story with nothing to hype it up overall though you just want to see godzilla and kong kick some ass and theres plenty and i mean plenty of it here
i watched it on the big screen in imax and its the only way to see this been a godzilla and kong fan my whole life and seeing every movie from the beginning starting with king kong in  its come a long wayi thought the cgi and effects were great it had a good story too you are able to learn more about the hollow earth and what lies deep in the uncharted territory theres so much more to explore there hoping they will come out with more after this flicki loved gvk but this movie had more action with fights every other scene i liked the new look for godzilla its always good to see him evolve kong will always be my favorite though maybe now he can get his king titlefor all fans of godzilla and kong its well worth it the real fans will notice some little details they threw in from the toho showa era
i liked s godzilla i found kong skull island okay i havent seen the monarch tv series or the second godzilla film or gvk but i kinda wanted to see this because i was in the mood for some cgi loud bombastic fun and in that regard the film didnt disappoint at all it delivers on that promise of bright lights colour action and overwhelming sound effectsbut unfortunately even though i went in looking for that kind of fun movie this film is all over the place the story is just rubbish its garbage i didnt understand what most of the people were doing or why i kept seeing massive plot holes and the human characters werent the bestbut again i did enjoy it its entertaining if nonsensical i didnt go expecting a brilliant film but i did think that the story really could have been improved fun entertaining loud cgi effects laden films and films with a halfway decent story shouldnt be mutually exclusive they can mix on this occasion they didnt in my opinion
skarking an evil giant gingerape along with his minions and an enslaved kaiju plan on escaping the hollow earth hell to which they had been confined and conquering the planets surface standing in the way of this existential threat to humanity is kong godzilla and their puny human allies the target audience of this jejune opus is unclear  the bloodless action and comic relief seems to target undiscerning children yet the soundtrack is rockingoldies perhaps in an attempt to placate adults trying to remain interested or awake the cast is a bland generic mix playing bland generic d characters with an expressionless kaylee hottle back as mute jia so we can have some cloying newagey scenes of her signing to the giant simian and brian tyree henry returning to provide some nearpathologicallyunfunny comic relief as a talkative conspiratorial podcaster kaiju anthropomorphisation continues kong now looks like a hairy oldtestament patriarchbodybuilder with no gonads godzilla despite being cgi moves even more like a person in a costume than he did in the s scar king looks like a skinny guy in an orangutan costume with no gonads and mothra looks like a giant moth with cyd charisses legs the plot is nonsensical  just a bunch of setpieces glued together by some kind of vague unobtaniumtechnology and incredibly contrived twists kongs metalarm features prominently on the posters but its provenance in the storyline is ridiculously convenient and silly the monster fights are a mixed bag  the opening battle in rome is pretty good but the finale complete with cool slowmo and freezeframe effects is derivative and boring likely targeting toyetic profits kong has a new sidekick  a ginger minime proving that the writers hadnt learned from son of godzilla  that cute babykaiju are unwelcome in anything but saturdaymorning cartoons im concerned that in addition to his new pinkhighlights godzilla will show up in legendarys next film with godzooky in tow i was hoping that that last years godzilla minus one signaled a slowing in the decent of the franchise into pure dreck but sadly this outing number  by my count has just reaccelerated the unfortunate downward trajectory of japans iconic oversized radioactive metaphor
this was a movie that i heard was coming out but wasnt overly excited for im not sure why since these are fun i look at them like comic book movies my guess is that godzilla minus one blew me away that these pale in comparison now regardless i saw this the opening thursday at the gateway film center i had a list of movies to see for the weekend and this one worked best that daysynopsis two ancient titans godzilla and kong clash in an epic battle as humans unravel their intertwined origins and connection to skull islands mysterieswe start this off seeing king kong as he now lives in the hollow earth area under the surface he roams and hunts killing other things for food the giant gorilla is searching for others like him but hasnt found anything at the end of this opening sequence theres an earthquake that reveals theres something underneath we also see a monarch base nearby that is picking up something as well it looks like an uncharted area that is subterraneanup above godzilla is still roaming the world and defeating titans that are getting out of their territory ilene andrews rebecca hall is the head of kong operations for monarch theyre getting a signal that they cannot explain she notices that her daughter jia kaylee hottle is drawing the signal she tells ilene that it feels like someone is calling out to her psychically this signal causes her to reach out to bernie hayes brian tyree henry hes a conspiracy theorist blogger and podcaster who is right about things he thinks outside of the box so she needs his helpgodzilla also seems to be affected by this signal we see him attack a power plant in france drawing its power he then sets his sights on attacking tiamat another titan who absorbs solar energy king kong also comes up to the surface he has an infected tooth so monarch reaches out to trapper dan stevens for help hes a titan veterinarian they replace the tooth with a metal one this must be done fast before godzilla comes after him for the invasion of his territorythis signal needs to be figured out before it is too late ilene leads a team of trapper mikael alex ferns bernie and jia to figure it out they find that the monarch base in hollow earth is destroyed they discover a temple that looks to be made by humans this also reveals a legend that involves king kong godzilla and other titans one of which is known as the skar king and the other is shiva king kong isnt strong enough to defeat this threat alone hell need help monarch must convince godzilla and other titans to prevent the destruction of the planet as we know itthat is where ill leave my recap and introduction to the characters where i want to start is that the best part of these movies for me outside of the action and battle sequences is the lore they continue to build on they will take entities from religion and incorporate them into being titans here that includes tiamat and shiva or theyll take conspiracy theories like hollow earth and use that as well this is also good here is that they borrow from earlier kaiju movies for story elements im a fan there as well i wanted to give this information to delve deeper into themwhere ill then go would be with the new titans here id say that these are good to build on what the previous movie set up we know coming in that hollow earth is a thing for this world king kong knows that his species had called this world home but he cant find them hes continuing that search this leads him to go deeper into the subterranean area thats where more legends are explored kongs race are defenders of humanity godzilla is the defender of earth what is interesting is that we learnt about skar king which was good it also introduces shiva which i know is from hinduism this is more closely to the final fantasy games which is the god of ice this deity here is supposed to be a rival of godzilla or at least thats how they present this there are more elements here of the tribe that lived on skull island also tiamat is a mesopotamian goddess and appears in final fantasy games normally as a villaini want to shift to this last idea here this plays with the idea that kong is looking for others like him he has no place the same can be said for jia she is struggling in school ilene is determined to make her feel welcome or find something that does this does bring heart to the movie that i appreciated the idea is explored even more as we discover other giant apes and jias missing tribeall that is left for the story is that i noticed theres less commentary here about the environment im fine with that they went a bit heavy with this idea in the last couple movies this is focused more on hollow earth this leans to saving the world from destruction as well id also say that were seeing that theres a vet to help titans trapper also theyre still dealing with the government wanting to take over the program thats more of a passing idea something that stressed me out though was seeing the titans destroy things like the colosseum or the great pyramids of giza ive seen the former and know how breathtaking it is so theres that realist part of me that got tenselets then go over to what this is all about filmmaking what i mean here is the cgi and effects these movies are working with high budgets so the effects are on point ill be honest they look great especially on the big screen these movies are made for it theyre cgifest like the comic book movies i still have fun with the fight sequences they do wild things there i love seeing godzilla wreck other monsters and buildings cinematography is good with how they frame things and bring places that dont exist to life that was good the soundtrack also didnt seem to feature the iconic godzilla theme which is an issue for me other than that the rest of the music worked and the sound design to bring these creatures to lifeall that is left then is acting hall is fine here shes a good actress but her performance isnt a focus i like her as this scientist wanting to help kong and in turn the world henry adds comedy hes also smart about things that people dont believe in i liked the addition of stevens hes a surfer guy who is just having a good time hes also smart in his field hottle was solid in her role she is featured prominently again and that worked for what they did there ferns fala chen and the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed again the kaijus are the focus here no one is bad though which is all i askin conclusion this is a fun popcorn movie i include these in horror since i just lump in kaiju film this isnt traditional horror outside of that what ill say is that i love building more on the mythology of these monsters seeing them do battle is the draw incorporating more titans is great this is well made they have a big budget so the cgi looks good the framing and cinematography to capture all this is good wont be for everyone but if you want something to shut off your brain and roll with this is for youmy rating  out of 
godzilla minus one has set the bar just too high this movie was way below the previous version godzilla is reduced to supporting role godzilla just sleeps wakes up fights and then again goes to sleep the human characters are just so uninspiring now every godzilla movie will be compared to minus ones standardsthe villain of the movie scar i expected more from him scar never looked dominating it just used shimu to fight even the mecha was better than scar godzilla has become boring since there is really no challenge to godzilla we already know the result of the fight whenever godzilla is pitted against any monster there is no vulnerability and without vulnerability godzilla is reduced to just plot tool
this film was very fun to watch its rewatchable for its pure entertainment value the action begins as soon as the movie starts and it doesnt let up until the credits roll it is by no means a perfect film the human characters continue being the worst part about these films the majority of the human characters are unnecessary the humor from the human characters often felt forced and childish even the plot could have been pushed forward without the humans and made this more enjoyablethe special affects are good throughout the majority of the film although kong does look a bit cartoony at the beginning of the film right before the title card godzilla is the best looking monster out of all the creatures but he unfortunately had the least amount of screen time the story focuses mostly on kong so dont expect too much from godzillaoverall this was a good film to catch on the big screen and enjoy with the family
it feels empty i dont feel a connection to either of the characterssame old setting where an american movie makes me feel empathy for the monster in the movie and its starting to feel disgusting to watch such movies a monster is a monster you try to make it look like the good guy but eventually danger and fierceness are objective truth be told it will remain a monster i could care less and many others if you continuously tell me that a bad situation could indiscriminately turn into a meaningful lesson which is false you cant expect everyone to think worryless and accept everything good or bad whatsoever such as movies that continuously tell you that normal is not normal and that you need to be absurd to live a peaceful life because that is the message godzilla needs to impose fear and have an allout war with humanity the same as kong not a dozen of people trying to help them get along and brush their teeththe story is almost the same as the last movie some federal agents trying to find out who the next targeted monster is now is not godzilla that is hunting for kong its just kong discovering a new land and a new enemy which is a boring turn its also taking too long to get to the main plot again nothing newcomedy is sketchy as always and as well as breathed besides comedy should have not made an appearance in such an apocalyptic story the black guy from the last movie which is on this too is still not funny just a forced humor which is not homophobic if you wonder but telling the reality of thingsvisual effects are monotone there are too many special effects and lack real response on the setting a natural landscape not one made by a computer or less of any of iti dont recommend this movie
if you like giant monster fights youll love this film this movie is packed with tons of great kaiju on kaiju fights the film does a good job showing a great dynamic between godzilla and kong almost reminds me of a brother relationship with how they fight and get along to team up the villain is a very menacing creature and is a great opposite to kong the human cast is good its about what youd expect from a godzillakong movie the film does a really amazing job not focusing too much on the filler human stories and highlights the true stars of the movie godzilla and kong the movie also has some great comedic moments with mini kong and the human cast overall a solid film so if you like godzilla kong or giant monsters in general you love this film dont worry about critic ratings movies like this arent made for them anyway
   picture the main character seems to be named godzilla x kong that dudes christian name is so outlandish that it is not even recognized by this sites spellchecker furthermore the last name is not such an acceptable moniker either other than donkey kong who used to play for the lions how many kongs are known to the average person not very many hong kong doesnt really count since that denotes a city in asianot an individual person finally viewers are never informed as to what kongs middle initial abbreviates here again the choices appear to be rather limited theres xavier known mostly as a school with a basketball team beyond that xray is about the only other option and linguists generally wont count that one
i was really excited for godzilla vs kong but it let me down the story felt thin and i just couldnt get attached to any of the characters it seemed like all the effort went into the special effects and even the cgi sucked and not enough into the story that makes you care sometimes the fights were so over the top that i couldnt even keep up and instead of being fun it was just confusing i wanted to love it for the spectacle but without a story to hook me i walked away feeling pretty disappointed i dont recommend wasting your time watching this garbage just walk away or watch anything else
if youre a big fan of kong youre absolutely gonna love this kong is a legend thats all i have to say im team kong all the way im not gonna give away any spoilers but i must say this was really good the directors stepped their game up with godzilla x kong the last movie wasnt bad but it wasnt great either i went to go see the early premiere i didnt want to see the movie at first but im glad i did there are some scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat and theres like one scene that may or may not make you cry its a good movie one of the best of  if youre looking for a great action pack movie i highly recommend you go see godzilla x kong
this movie delivers classic kaiju action fun accessible but ultimately forgettable in the monsterverse landscape while the visuals are fantastic with tons of epic monster brawls on screen the plot feels a bit thin especially the final fight the human characters are purely functional there to explain things and move the story along leaving the kaiju with surprisingly more personality ideally both humans and monsters would be compelling characters but here were left with cool fights but a lack of emotional investment its a popcorn flick pure and simplea thing i might add is can legendary not spoil a villain andor their power for once
the positive reviews on here must be fake this is easily one of the worst movies ive ever seen cash grab citythey did this weird thing trying to humanize king kong genius writers entirely missed the point they see some old kk scenes where humans and kong interact or have similarities and think wow we are same same king kong is just like us hes truly so human at heartyou fools king kong is the the king of apes he is a wild beast any similarity is because we are apes not because hes humanbefore you even understand whats happening king kong is on a human style heroic journey disney style befriending his enemies and just i cantwatch this movie but so you can just get it out of your system and give up on hollywood all together not to enjoy
i did not have any expectations whatsoever before watching the film  after the trailers dropped i was kind of disappointed  but it was one hell of a ride in the theatres really enjoyed it it is fun  action  packed  it has comedy  two or more gigantic monsters fighting on the big screen and it was damn fun kong is the main focus of the story and it does make sense because he is a character that can connect with people the human characters are actually likable in this one especially brian tyree henry as bernie and dan stevens as trapper rebecca halls character dr irene andrews is good aswell but the main thing i loved about the film was its epic climax it was great overall the film is fun and entertaining thats all
the perfect definition of a popcorn movieits full of amazing effects loud and adrenaline fuelled action scenes and the children loved itthe story however was little bit of a mess even when not expecting anything oscar winning going into itfar too many convenient coincidences such as just happening to have a metal right handed fist just lying around in hollow earth makes even a fantasy movie hard to followand therefore hard to become invested in when we move from one action set piece to the next with no real feeling of jeopardythe monsters all did their thing but the human comic relief didnt really hit the spot for mei guess sometimes its ok to just sit back and enjoy some dumb entertainment on the big screen from time to time thoughnot one i will remember or watch again
at the risk of sounding pretentious after seeing godzilla minus one less than five months ago my expectation for what a kaiju movie completely changed wherein that film was a thoughtful exciting and mature take on godzilla using the monster as a backdrop for bigger things godzilla x kong the new empireis mostly just monster stuffand hey thats not necessarily a bad thing people have been clamouring for an american kaiju movie that sets the human characters aside and focuses primarily on the massive creatures that destroy our cities godzilla x kong tne does this pretty well spending the vast majority of its run time in hollow earth a realm beneath our own where kong now lives full of fascinating and gargantuan creaturesmy favourite parts of the movie were where the monsters  mostly kong  interacted with other monsters it was a surprisingly good showcase of non verbal storytelling that naturally gives this movie a lot of international appealbut i cant help but feel this movie could be and should bemore it really does feel like a kong movie that godzilla just happens to feature in his inclusion almost feels unnecessary then of course there are the human charactersminus one proved that great human drama and characters are not only possible but elevate kaiju movies this one isnt bad rebecca hall and dan stevens are fine brian tyree henry is on the verge of being annoying but he works the little girl is really terrible somehow despite have zero spoken dialog she cant properly convey the emotions shes supposed to be expressing with her face alone unintentional hilarity ensuestheres also more people like her who are weirdly and inexplicably mute and in a movie with so much grunting and roaring i felt that was an odd choice the lore of the movie is pretty tacked on and doesnt leave much of an impression it also doesnt make a lot of sense but its fineoverall godzilla x kong tne is fine its nothing particular special and its not bad but i can only hope for the next one we get a bit more ambition and creativity
is this the direction the monsterverse is going toward just dumping  on the visuals that doesnt make a good movie tho the dialogs are cringe story plot is very predictable and theres is meaningful character developmenthows godzilla being depicted as a hero character when he casually kills millions every time he walks thru a city not to mention its getting boring now whenever he powers up thru his spines it was cool in  but its  and do they still expect us to get excited by the atomic breathcan characters stop cracking jokes every chance they get is that too much to ask nowadays especially when a guy is eaten by a tree it is supposed to be horrifying
lets grab this one first this movie is not minus one it will never be minus one but this movie in its own way is amazing its funny its entertaining its overall funall the characters play off eachother well all characters have a connection all characters have chemistry and thats not just human characters godzilla and kong are amazing in this one too skar king is also awesome him and shimo pose an actual threat that is seen through the whole movie and not just the end like godzilla vs kong all the twists and all the details are  the story is amazing just go see it
overall godzilla x kong the new empire is a good entertaining movie which has some flaws especially too much humour but the overall storyline and cast performance is great the two giants godzilla and kong are the highlights of the movie it comes and just promises to deliver even more interesting moments between them however godzilla is barely not seen that much in this movie but kong is absolutely brilliant female characters of the monsterverse movies are a complete waste as they dont have much to do cast did well story is engaging and interesting direction is good too it keeps you hooked especially at the best moments of the movieoverall the film is a good watch not perfect but still a good decent watch entertainer which isnt a stand out of the monsterverse movies but still a thumbs up i would say its good a  stars
a movie that missed to implement even the expected cliches only the murderer lift movie was worse was my first thought after i left the cine i had absolutely no idea about what was going on the whole time when i thought i did they threw in some new thing that made the whole thing just even more nonsense so many ways they could have made this film better the little girls visions more of it the guy that died  maybe a love story so many missed opportunities for us connect with the characters i found myself laughing throughout the last  in several occasions painful to watch i dont know how it got even a  rotten tomato award for me and that is not only this years but my forever charts for sure
i went and saw this yesterday with my dad and a couple of friends and it was amazing it was really funny and i loved how godzilla got more powerful throughout the movie and kong getting a glove that is extremely powerful and i thought it was interesting that it took place more on hollow earth rather than actual earth as it has been in the previous godzilla movies and godzilla vs kong and i think its just as good as godzilla vs kong but this one is a little bit better but its another great movie and i cant wait to see what will be next either a tv show or a movie who knows im curious whats gonna happen next
i am a fan of the monsterverse having said that i liked godzilla  over all the other films save kong skull island after the last couple of films i went in with lowered expectations for this what i ended up viewing was an unexpected surprisethe pacing is much quicker in this movie the monsters take up the majority of the screentime with minimal focus on the humans this made a huge differencemy main complaint with the film is a minor quibble of personal taste i am a godzilla fan over kong kong is the focal point of the story with godzilla only showing up when necessary this happens several times mind you i also found the mystery kaiju baddie to be slightly lame but when you see the last shot of kong in the movie the choice made sensei have seen the film twice it did not grow stale on second viewing
godzilla and king kong dont work they dont match they are a bad couple they place an unbearable burden on a screenplay that tries to include them both as such the monsterverse surely cant continue it needs to pick a focus and relegate the other colead to a guest star or recurring character status either that or pull the plug entirelythe two couples matchup isnt dramatic because it isnt plausible because it is completely contrived and blatantly impracticalthe plot and characters suffer heavily because this film is entirely stymied by its central miscasting which is the miscasting of the whole monsterverse this franchise aint big enough for the two of themit ends up working like a two hour trailer with a storyline held together by a humanised kong story about his loneliness and aging being parallelled by his human friends apart from that tenuous connective tissue the film is all made up of character entrances a quick distinctive skit and then cut just like a trailer or if it has less overall thrust to it a best of highlights reelthere is also an effort to further expand the hollow earth issues but that barely registers as a success because it isnt very interestingthe cinematography and direction are mediocre at best with murky and unappealing photography of the cast in almost all human character scenesthe sound design barely registers except in an effort to portray the monsters callsi rate at  because the film doesnt work the monsterverse doesnt work because its an odd couple of stars too odd i recommend to confirmed fans only
i feel like the studio is listening to the fans there were far less human driven plotlines the humans were mostly there just to add the explanation for what was happening dan stevens proves he can crush any role hes given he had the best performance staring as hot ace venturamy biggest complaint is while godzilla got top billing this was mostly a kong movie i guess universal is leaning into the part of the franchise they own the other godzilla kaiju that makes an appearance was also minimal  and unnecessary godzilla could have taken on every one else  even kong with his upgradesbut if you go in knowing what you expect and dont expect more its a good time
this is one for the cinemas you want the biggest screen and the most thunderous sound to really take advantage of this moviethe story is ok the acting etc is all servicable but its all about the titansa couple of areas where the film falls mothra has become a massive fairy straight out of a little kids movie and the film starts to feel a bit like transformers and their gang of cool kidsadditionally the soundtrack is a massive miss with classic s tracks really just going for the teen viewers parents market it doesnt add to the film at allat the end of the day its a titan fest so its all good 
forgot there are humans and wordsbut overall very solid movie humans covered all cliches nicely words and words some more words  oh also gestures the world is pretty amazing a friendlier avatar world easy to get to and great animalsplants hmm well the big  and few others are amazing i missed or part of brain holding memories from intro movie are gone going to avoid ruining anything by talking more you already made up your mind  because its godzilla haha have fun movie will test boyfriends and reverse  so hope you know your partner well parents no nudity or sex or alcohol i cant remember anyone swearing except the monsters
"how can companies like warner brothers and legendary pictures create such a dumb movie i mean the only reason i watched it till the end is just to see what godzilla will do otherwise this is a movie that is extremely terrible and has no actual story to it and the worst part of it all is the cast the script especially when that main actress talks its so cliché its beyond cringe
the cast is just terrible and completely dont belong in the movie and whats with all the writers or actually i think there were no writers for this film because even people from high school can literally create the same script that i was hearing in the movie how major studios doing such brainless movies like this it will hurt the franchise of godzilla thank god for the other movie that was released months ago which is the original story of godzilla"
i saw godzilla x kong the new empire starring rebecca hallthe night house iron man  dan stevenslegiontv night at the museum secret of the tomb brian tyree henrybullet train joker and kaylee hottlethis is her second movie after godzilla vs kongthis is the sequel to the  godzilla vs kong and the latest installment in the monsterverse rebecca returns with her adopted daughter kaylee and we learn more about the mysteries of skull island hollow earth and other assorted titansmonsters dan is a friendveterinarianpilot that adds some comedy to the intense situations and brian is a blogger along for the ride to get more followers for his podcast you meet more titans and apes including skaran apeand his enslaved captive pet shimo a titan with ice powers that skar sicks on kong and godzilla suko is sort of a mini kong but no relation to kong during a fight kong hurts his hand and thanks to dan and rebecca gets an upgrade to a new augmented glove called b e a s tbio enhanced anatomech seismic thunderwhich comes in handy for the big free for all near the end when all the titans get into a wrestlemania styled tag team event fyi there is an appearance of a really well known titan named mothraits rated pg for creature violence and action and has a running time of  hour   minutesi really enjoyed this one and would buy it on bluray
the monsterverse films got progressively less serious in all aspects with each movie until godzilla vs kong in  which became so completely ridiculous and fun that it was impossible to believe it was in the same universe as the  godzilla it was mainly due to that i didnt like it much the first time but learned to appreciate it more on a rewatch for what it was rather than expecting a consistent tone from this particular cinematic franchise even though this one continues to be dumb fun it felt like a step up from the previous one the central character here is essentially kong and everyone else is a supporting character being the most emotionally available that throughline itself was more than what the previous one offered but here the film is selfaware enough to call itself out but doesnt try to ram it too muchbrian tyree henry was annoying af in the previous movie and wouldve changed nothing if he and the characters with him were removed from that movie here he manages to be charming enough to fit into that comic relief role the introduction to dan stevenss character made me feel like it would be another annoying character but he turned out to be one of the best things of this movie for me a lovable hippy with great comic chemistry with brian tyree henrythe action and visuals were plenty and good for such a fun dumb movie the writing is just there to justify the action and really nothing more no point trying to find depth or logic in it the inconsistencies in the franchise are growing but at this point i dont think anyone really caresevery time mothra has an appearance they subtly use the music from the original song of  into the soundtrack without it playing out in the open give us the modern mosra song already please
"embarrassing that grown adults made these choices complete  total nonsense with the most mind numbing jumble of flashing vfx trying to make it lighthearted should work but it just makes it worse

went in this movie with a open mind and turned out to be one of the best godzilla and kong movie i have ever seen and it brought a lot of nostalgia for me and hit home for me growing up watching all the toho movies godzilla mothra and rodan the visuals were amazing to me never once did i see a part of this movie that didnt look finished everything was so emmersive and alive the scenes with just the monsters were also great it added a new element in this monster verse it truly was one crazy wild ride that i wont forget i hope they make a trilogy out of the godzilla and kong movies cause when it ended i wanted more any one that is a monster fan should love this movie because i did and thanks again for everyone that worked on this film brought alot of good childhood memories back for me
godzilla vs kong the new empire packs a punch with its gripping action and the adorable relationship between kong and mini kong the titans certainly deliver on their role but the humans also play a significant part in the films narrative and take up equal screen time in this onehowever a slightly longer runtime could have allowed for more titan screen time and a slower pace to fully let viewers indulge in the epic showdowndespite this the film roars with its stunning visual effects and heart pounding action sequences watch it in imax to appreciate every moment of the monstrous clashoverall the film offers a thrilling cinematic experience that will leave fans of the monsterverse craving for more
this cinematic catastrophe is an affront to the very concept of filmmaking a soulless mindnumbing experience that insults the intelligence of its audience the story is a jumbled mess of nonsensical plot twists cringeworthy dialogue and laughable character developmentthe acting is a joke with wooden performances that make you wonder if the actors were even aware of the scripts absurdity the only redeeming quality is the impressive special effects which are a rare bright spot in this messthe action scenes are a jumbled mess of loud frantic chaos with no coherence or purpose the plot is a sloppy contrived mess with characters making ridiculous decisions and convenient coincidencesthe script is an absolute travesty with characters speaking in clichés and oneliners that make you roll your eyes the worldbuilding is nonexistent with hollow earth feeling like a hastily throwntogether excuse for a settingavoid this monstrosity at all costs if you value your sanity stay far far away from this garbage leave godzilla to the japanese where it belongs
after the tv series monarch which had its light moments but had a seriously dramatic bent gvktne is a silly adventure story one part planet of the apers one part the ateam and one part the avengers with foot apes and lizardslike the mcu following the spy thriller captain america the winter soldier with the comedic guardians of the galaxy the monsterverse has taken a tonal shift between projects and it does keep it fresh the humans are the silliest part a mismatched ragtag illprepared team that manages to assist kong the characters are cutout stereotypes the scientist mother who cant help her child the goofy s throwback charming ex the comedic blingcovered nerd who talks his way into the mission and is terrified of everything and the unfriendly pilot with the scottish burr their mission is to escort a teen girl who is mute the last of her kind and somehow in telepathic contact with someonethe title is a misnomer since godzilla has far far less screen time than kong and adds very little to the plot other than being first a barrier and then an aid in the main story his own character journey basically follows his day between napsthe journey of kong to find family is touching but predictable the behaviors of the chief bad guy are drawn from the dummies guide to villainous tropes kong gets a companion who is basically scrappy kongbut of course everyone comes to a monsterverse movie to see the monsters mix it up and this film delivers the fights are fun wellstaged and filled with impressive cgi effects nothing new but fun to watcha fun film to watch on a big screen if you arent looking for anything to engage your mind
godzilla x kong the new empire delivers the monstrous mayhem fans crave the cgi is topnotch bringing the titans to life in all their atomicbreathed skyscraperstomping glory the fight sequences are epic but sometimes too short reminding me of godzilla final wars at timeshowever theres a growing sense that the monsterverse is venturing into familiar territory the plot while serviceable recycles the threat to humanity trope this time with a mysterious entity from the depths of the earththis is where we start to see the avengersification of the monsterverse become apparent theres a sense of setting the stage for a bigger baddie down the line a cosmic kaiju thanos ready to snap his irradiated fingerswhile theres nothing wrong with a good oldfashioned brawl between giant lizards and apes one cant help but wonder if the monsterverse is losing its unique charm so should you see godzilla x kong the new empire absolutely its a popcornmunching extravaganza with enough citycrushing action to satisfy even the most jaded kaiju fan just be prepared for a familiar formula with a hint of what might be coming next
going into this movie i wasnt expecting much i just thought oh another godzilla and kong movie but to my surprise this was actually a lot better than i thought the plot line was interesting and actually went well with the movie it kept me invested in the movie the whole time there was definitely a lot to be left wanting in the movie but for someone who was on the fence about going in the first place i was actually pretty surprised did this movie live up to godzilla minus one no but it didnt need to two different movies i like the fact that there was action comedy and at times drama i would recommend this movie to someone who was a long or godzilla fan
 and im just not impressed the film is too bright and too pink godzilla  set the right tone it was serious stuff skull island whilst not brilliant was still better than this king kong  had less impressive but not immersive sfx godzilla  was more enjoyable with better characters and bonus spot the simpsons voice actor materialthis just isnt good and im wondering if i can even be bothered to watch the rest of it im not sure what theyve done differently with the sfx but the idea is that no matter how ridiculous its supposed to still look realistic and this doesnt it looks like a game which appears to have been the intention of the creatorsi dont really like anything about this film it is inferior to every monster verse movie in every way possible kong is no longer an ape but some anthropomorphised upright humanoid and none of the human tech looks remotely realistic none of it is good and i hate the creators and director for making some planet of the apes with dragons rubbish instead of a proper monster movie for grownups
big fight coming godzilla vs kong the new empire is not another monstah smash movie its like the biggest best part of the whole monsterverse story heres why you gotta see itthis is just the beginning director wingard says the new empire is only the first part of a much bigger story people are saying there might be new monsters and even teamups between them being there for this big moment in the monsterverse is something you dont want to misshere are some points which i summarized for you from movies award winning visuals remember how amazing godzilla  looked the new empire is even better director adam wingard famous for how careful he is with details promises a movie that looks more real than anything else think crazy special effects mixed with giant monster suits making you feel like youre right there monsters get smarter this new movie isnt just about a bigger fight its about smarter fighting godzilla and kong learned new things since their last rumble godzilla now king of all the monsters has a super strong atomic breath and knows how to fight better kong found a new home underground with other cool monsters and maybe even has special powers or weapons  the fight will be more strategic and surprising keeping you guessing the whole time back to the story a lot of fans thought the monsterverse forgot about the people in godzilla king of the monsters the new empire brings back the story of how regular people deal with these giant monsters there are new heroes fighting to survive this human part of the story makes us care more about the monsters and whats happening secret world under the ground before we only heard rumors about a hidden place under the ground called hollow earth where the monsters might come from the new empire takes us there imagine kong showing us glowing caves with new creatures maybe even enemies of godzilla from way back this underground world could change the whole monsterverse storywhat should you do dont believe everything you hear right away but the people making the movie are really good and everyone is talking about how amazing it looks and the cool story ideas the new empire has a good chance of surprising youso what do you want a boring monster fight or to see the monsterverse become even bigger and better godzilla vs kong the new empire promises amazing pictures a great story and a whole new world for the monsters this is a movie no monster fan or anyone who likes giant monster fights should miss
it has to get at least three stars because its got dan stevens and his piercing eyes in it otherwise this is an entirely derivative and predictable effort that leaves nothing at all to our imagination a truce has broken out since the last time  with kong ruling the roost deep in hollow earth godzilla curled up asleep in the coliseum and ilene rebecca hall and the troubled jia kaylee hottle keeping an eye on things for monarch and mankind kong has a bad tooth so he comes to the humans for help fortunately trapper the aforementioned ds is a dab hand at grandscale dentistry but its while the ape is topside that alarm bells go off godzilla starts marauding again and an undiscovered vortex in the nether world requires investigation by kong and his human pals with bernie brian tyree henry back in the gang off they all go to discover that a new menace has arrived destroyed their monitoring outpost and it is now setting up a battle royal with just about every titan left on earth  above or below adam winyard does just about everything on this film and that shows in a complete lack of objectivity when evaluating this third rate adventure the banal writing and equally lacklustre acting its as plain as the nose on your face why godzilla  who doesnt feature so much in this  is collecting energy and when we do eventually get to them the combat scenes are repetitive and too tightly choreographed the scale is all over the place too at times kong appears the size of an house at others hes more like a mouse the visual effects are put to good use but hall just underwhelms henry talks way too much and stevens busky humour just doesnt hit home at all i know its difficult to keep coming up with new ideas for this genre and it must be difficult for the actors to constantly engage with nothing but some greenscreen but the story is thin and the film reminds you of just about everything from jurassic park to episodes of stargate it does need a big screen though on television it will be even more forgettable  but i did like the moth
i was hoping to be mildly entertained by this movie but wow was i disappointed in so many wayswhy have godzilla in the title when this is obviously a son of kong movie made by kong fanboy adam wingardthey said this was a throwback to the showa era of godzilla movies didnt they realize that even toho thought a lot of the showa movies were crap and wanted to retire godzilla for a while until someone could create something that wasnt pure garbagei hope if there is another legendary kaiju movie they let someone else other than adam wingard to direct it and for the love of all things get rid of the stupid marvel team up plots they arent working for marvel anymore and they definitely wont work for a kong movie featuring  minutes of a now pink godzilla
"the experience of titans godzilla and kongs screen presence and many goosebumps moment experience the movie in nearby theatres in this film they showed the titans life so dont worry about the any lag in the movie the movie was going smooth from start to endwatch it on theatres experience in theatres only dont waste the movie by watching it on ottthe technicians had worked a lotthe movie greater than godzilla vs kong
the screen presence and the fights between the titans were fabulous and had a great experience by watching it on d loved it experience the movie in theatres im not gonna spoil it here"
i can honestly understand if so many people think this movie is lame and give it  star but honestly once it is monsters you dont expect logic or etci am a fan of godzilla and if even it shows up in the moon i will love itbut i truly believe that it still could have much more better plotthe writers seem to struggle creating a story and quickly get to the pointit could be much more better with a very interesting story there could have been much more interesting monsters to put in it rather than a scarfaced monkeywe had kidoras head in ending scene of previous episode so they could create an interesting story about it but they chose to make godzilla and kong friends so that they could bring them back against other monsters in future and continue the godzilla story linestill i say as a fan i would give it  but if i was not a fan it would get let me not to forget to say about its amazing graphics but also lame custom design
so bad its hilarious but probably only if youre smart enough to get stoned beforehand the characters arent likeable funny or entertaining monster fight after monster fight but mostly unsatisfying certainly causes some whiplash from the amount of back and forth between godzilla kong humans etc nothing really feels like its on the line and theres such a lack of actual tension dialogue doesnt add anything to the movie except explanation the characters feel like fluff with little to no value added to this movie if you dont take anything seriously and dont care how bad it is it can be pretty funny
i just came back from watching godzilla x kong from the theatres it is exactly what it was promised  theres no strong plot just action because thats what were here for and yes godzilla and kong also fight for a brief moment but i will keep this review spoiler freelike many people have already said here godzilla only appears for a small time you know like those anime where the heros rival is shown to be on his own adventure doing his own little quest until the hero calls him that rival here is godzilla while the hero is kong and i mean that literally kong is the one who travels around middle earth and discovers an enslaved giant gorilla civilisation being ruled by an evil skar king he has also enslaved shimo a fourfooted ice version of godzilla who is being mind controlled by skar king to threaten any gorilla that dares to oppose himunlike what most people are saying here i actually thought the human plot was pretty good this time around there was less talking and more action i also didnt mind the lack of story because lets be real who goes to watch a movie of this franchise expecting a story anywaymy problem was with the departure of the pov that was in the first movies if you watch the  godzilla you will see that the camera angle makes you feel like youre in godzillas world you dont see the world from godzillas perspective you see godzilla from the worlds perspective and thats what made godzilla feel so big and scary same goes with king of the monsters here however the middle earth is seen from the perspective of kong himself because of this everything doesnt appear as gigantic as it is supposed to be it just feels like a normal gorilla roaming around the forestanother problem was with the lack of d effects i watched the movie in d but there were barely any things that felt worth it the title screen looked good but thats about it and no my seating place wasnt a problem because i was sitting in the last row so everything felt like actual creatures behind the screen that effect was good but the times the movie tries to make godzilla or kong lunge at the screen fails to make it believe that they will fall on you
maybe i enjoyed it more because my expectations were lowered by the last one went from godzilla being kinda dark and gritty  skull island being less  king of the monsters being somewhere in between  syfy presents godzilla vs kong which really really really really was unsatisfyingso coming to this i was expecting nothing and what i got was a movie id gladly leave on in the background while doing chores and not paying attention to anything which i mean compared to what weve been getting at least it wasnt trying too hard to satisfy multiple angles it was unapologetically giant lizard sucks up power while giant ape investigates the center of the earth with help of deafpsychic kid and friends and ends up giant lizard gets pink swole and helps giant ape with new robot fist defeat crazy giant chimp who enslaved giant apes long lost family and also the giant moth comes back because ancient astronaut theorists were almost not wrong about an advanced civilization that harnessed mysterious powers to build the pyramids and foretold the coming of the psychic deaf kid who woke it up from being dead in the last movie by the science magic of sparkly dust
you get what you expect from this film especially if youve seen the previous instalments in the franchisethere is some exciting monster action that cant be denied it perhaps takes a little long to get stuck into this and there should definitely have been more but when we get it it is pretty good it maybe feels a little similar to the previous film though i think if this franchise wants to move forward it needs to find a way to shake things up a bit and try to reinvent itselfthe human side of things as ever is where this film gets let down there is some half decent monster mythology that gets explored but really the humans only exist to progress the monster action that would be fine but they dwell on the human side of things for too long either develop the characters and the story lines or just dramatically reduce the human characters screen time this film makes us spend a little too much time with them for me with very little rewardoverall though this film is a decent bit of fun i dont think its as good as godzilla vs kong but it just about does the job
godzilla and king kong unite once again to fight a common kaiju enemy in godzilla x kong the new empire booms and pows ensue if thats all you need close this windowas ive noted before im detecting a pattern in the way godzilla sequels devolve back in the day we began with a powerful posthiroshima and nagasaki dirge in the form of s godzilla  originally named gojira in japan and later needlessly retooled for american viewers  and before you knew it the onceterrifying titular beast who had seemed so large and imposing a few movies ago was sliding forth on his tail and dropkicking his enemy of the week in flicks that later became mystery science theater subjectsand now decades later we have the monsterverse which started out with esque images of horror and has now culminated in a kaiju wrestling match where a big ape rides upon a big lizard to go fight another ape on another lizard to make things funnier the japanese seem to have come full circle and returned to making godzilla films that are deep and resonant  using the monster as a ghost of world war ii as ebert once put it  in the form of the phenomenal oscarwinning godzilla minus onefollowing the release of that film its hard to accept the defense that godzilla x kong is just a monster movie and that it doesnt make sense to expect more from it than monsters punching each other im afraid weve all seen the truth we know we could be getting morebut never mind what i would like to see from the kaiju genre how does godzilla x kong fare as a monster brawl well nows the time to tell you that my issue isnt that its inherently wrong to opt for mindless fun over trying to achieve thematic resonance through more grounded action  its that the attempt at mindless monster fun isnt that greati suppose it delivers what you came for even as we waste some time on stupid prophecy nonsense and questionable interludes of cuteness theres a scene where king kong basically goes to the dentist as for the battles themselves theyre no doubt wellmade but they left me in a state of so what thats part of why its hard for me to not compare it to its direct franchise predecessoryes sometimes simians clobbering reptiles is enough but imagine these fight scenes if we also cared and there was emotional gravity to the action  or even regular gravity better yet what if they leaned further into a toho sequel homage and didnt seem to genuinely think king kong floating around with a magical axe in hollow earth is epic and cool as is i can feel myself starting to forget most of what i saw in here was the axe even magicalsomething i did like about the previous film godzilla vs kong is adam wingards direction even as the human characters in these films still arent anything to cheer for although i thought the human drama worked fine in the early bits of the  original and last years monarch legacy of monsters partly warmed me up to the idea of learning more about the homo sapien side of the lore wingard at least made the gvk dialogue scenes look great  atmospheric prismatic and bathed in line of purples neon here we get similarly colorful sequences yet they do very little to make the material more interestingi understand if i sound too demanding or even spoiled its worth reminding oneself what an amazing age of fx we live in and how doubly amazing it must be for the og nerds imagine watching s original king kong or any of the ray harryhausen classics as a kid  not to mention that film from  where a massively resized kong finally did meet godzilla both played by actors in shoddy suits could you ever have dreamed that wed one day see movies  spectacles  like the ones we have nowif you were that kid i guess you shouldnt let me stop you  even as you might have nitpicks of your own regarding lore or whether the monsters should really move like this especially considering the sense of scale and weight that gareth edwards gave to these things when this particular verse was established i do think you should go see it i cannot promise you will remember much about it i think you might have fun i also think godzilla himself being a recent oscar winner and all deserves moreregardless happy th godzilla may you either evoke the horrors of manmade annihilation or brofist a photorealistic gamera in whatevers next either way well be seated
"pros
there are some sequences remind me of parts of the franchise great tributethey build the character of the titanus good enough to make them interesting to watch even without humans for a monster movie like this we dont care much about humans so instead of building strong characteristics for humans they build strong characteristics for the kaijus especially the scar king is so smart and evil almost feel like he is a humanthis is a true monster movie with many monsters timing and less humans on it and still makes the watchers understand without subtitles the most monters screentime of the franchise everthe best part of the movie is the hollow earth battle between the at some sequences scar king shimo looks so gigantic and cool which makes the whole audience awe in superised and interestingcos
please change the style sorry for the director and film crew but this style is getting boring and unfitted to godzilla franchise it looks superficial bring it back to  style where monsters feel like monstersthe film doesnt show the mega heavy sizes of kaijus they move very fast at some sequences their skins look like wax the color grading in hollow earth is very natural but in the earths world looks oppositethe final battle is predicted and has zero climax they easily win without a plot twist which the franchise did very well in all  previous films especially too many background music overusing music i feel like  of the scenes have music on it which makes viewers feel like they are watching a music video not a movie a good movie must makes the watchers feel like they are into that world of film and to make that the film should have more perspective view more one shots less cuts and less bg music just voices and ambient sound like natural sound"
godzilla x kong it was a long sit after allpositive small kong fights animals some good jokes from the discord guy somebody did write it had guardians of galaxy vibes it is also not that funny however it was fine the dentist guy had a nice touch to it a lot happens the pilotnegative female lead actrice uch awful the kid deaf language bad kong bad gonzilla the script first mins awful without any sense or soul way to much green screen scenes  the tribe movie has no soul or purpose felt like a hour movie whole underworld was a bit cheesy and to perfect bring in soms darkness and raw jungle vibessometimes i wonder why producers can not make a better movie then the orginial king kong from over  years agothey should or make this movie way more funnier and focus on humor or make this movie way more darker and raw now it is a bit of nothingall by all  which makes it a 
"when exactly everyone lowered their basic standards to underground levels tell bryan cranstons dying wife that the world will be safe because a giant super hero monkey with a transformers arm will team up with a caped crusder lizard to kung fu fight monsters and the earth is hollow and has a giant monkey city in it then come back and tell me how well that fits together as part of the same universe monkey hits lizard good  dont say otherwise or me throw poop at you if thats your level of intelligence you will love it but dont watch it or you will get worse please dont defend this movie by asking us to turn our brain off if thats your defense you already lost the deabate why dont you ask the writers to turn their brain on fun is not synonymous of stupid it wasnt it doesnt have to be and we already passed that oh thats right  wasnt hollywood here we go again of course its fair to compare it with  every movie with dinosaurs is still compared to jurassic park people can compare it with barbie or the smurfs if they want but this one doesnt even stand a comparison with godzilla  which is part of the not marvel universe it belongs and its the one has to be mandatory compared to dont turn off your brain for hollywood again enough is enough this movie is to godzilla  what batman and robin was to batman  and batman returns or what moonraker was to james bond they started as something believable and serious and someone else turned them later into goofy cartoons being a fan of godzilla and tokusatsu cinema and tv doesnt mean that i cannot distinguish quality from trash and as a healthy fan i always want quality not quantity i dont consume and blindly deffend everything because it says godzilla on it yes the showa era exists toho is embarrased of it any fan knows that do you they consider it as the lowest point of the franchise and thats why godzilla has never been that goofy at least in japan ever since but this is not a showa era godzilla movie its supposed ti part of the serious american godzilla  version which exists because the american  version was so terrible and goofy that they decided to scratch all sequels and reboot it in a serious direction with the  version but s was more believable than this new one why is  not equaly praised the showa era as goofy as it was was its own thingmess separatted from the originals canon godzilla has been reseted in japan at least  times but this ultra goofy american cartoon is not its own thing it is supposed to be a continuation of a movie where bryan cranston crying with a broken soul had to sacrifice his wife and colleagues to save the city and his son and he had to say goodbye while she was dying in front of him a movie where they tried to give weight and realism to a creature of more than m height and thousands of tons in weight where they tried to put on screen the consequences of its destruction and existence in the real world that was the selling point realism that was what was promised to the fans it delivered that promise but not as well as godzilla did yet it was a stept on the right direction how did we get from that  movie to this how is that a progress goofy movies are fun and have their space in cinema a bigger place than what they deserve no doubt of that i love so bad are good movies as much as the next man butbutbut i repeat that is when they are their own thing and not a continuation of something that was relatively realistic and serious and this one goes an extra mille triplying down with stupidity which makes it insulting to even kids intellligence after so many times complaining about studios telling us to turn off our brain when did you the raging fans decided to obey and celebrate that have some integrity godzilla and everything from nolan prove that movies can be intelligent and entertaining at the same time again no excuse specially godzilla reminded us  important things
  you can have an intelligent engaging and even inspiring story and visual spectacle at the same time thay they cannot exist together is an old lazy writers lie  people do like human characters when they are well writen and important for the plot these movies dont work without them they are the ones that suffer the consequences of the destruction and as the audirnce we need that  millions of dollars on visual efects are worth nothing if points  and  are not checked  not everything has to ripp off of marvelif you are a filmmaker who loves bad dumb movies create your own franchise and quit destroying others with continuations that are not even part of the same genre does jar jar binks fits in the godfathers universe everything has to be called a universe now thanks to marvel cake on face jokes i didnt think so neitherif you as most fans have complained of movies for being shallow dumb and for treating the audience as stupid cattle but you deffend this movie precisely for being all that dont you dare to trash batman and robin transformers anything from michael bay uwe boll fast and furious jurassic world sharknado birdemic the room again because thats called double standards turn your brain back on this movie is terrible and thats not a good thing"
the movie itself is gorgeous with its visual effects the fight scenes are entertaining and the destruction of the locations the fights take place are quite remarkableit is very important to say that if your last kaiju movie is one of the dramatic ones such as godzilla minus one and youre going to watch this with expectations matching that movie you will be underwhelmed by this this is an action movie not horror not drama it is a movie that focuses on the action above all elsethe human characters much like the other legendary titles are unfortunately quite unnecessary and frankly it really feels like the movie wouldnt change a bit if the scenes involving the human characters were cut off though the one in kotm and the first kvg are still worseso if you love big creatures fighting each other and causing havoc in notorious places and in hollow earth then go watch it you will have a good time
when watching godzilla vs kong  i generally consider the film to be cliché it doesnt have any distinct features that set it apart from similar movies the film seems to be written with only the second half in mind almost completely neglecting the first half the first part is very weak in terms of story development so im giving it just  points the second half however is quite successful and exciting in terms of action and i dont hesitate to give it  points although i must mention some absurd scenes overall the film leaves an average impression and deserves a total score of  the battle of the giant monsters is a fantastic subject for me i always watch it breathlessly the action scenes are truly impressive no complaints there however the clichés commonly found in bigbudget films can become tiresome at times i think there are points where the film could have utilized its potential better and offered a more original story if more creative risks were taken and there was deeper character development and script enhancement it could provide a more satisfying experience for fans of this genre as it stands godzilla vs kong  while delivering the expected grand clash stays only on the surface in terms of storytelling and character development
"remaking my review have alot more to say my good review is at the bottom first of all what that actual earth is going on
im astonished to see such high ratings the whole movie script is poofirstly the cgi at some parts were terrible and i felt like that there was more kong then godzilla i dont know but thats what i thought the whole storyline is so what on earth is happening in a way i sort of saw what they was trying to aim st here but it just kept dragging and dragging till the end the ending was so rushed scar king didnt really apper till midway of the movie and at first i was like hes hella scary but at the end i was like hes so useless without thst crystal thing he uses to control shimo as his personal defense system 🤣😭 like what poor shimo bless her she got treated like poo and again she didnt have so much of a role even tho she should have she just got mainly controlledthe other monsters in the movie that godzilla fault thst was all so poor at one point they kept cutting out the death of the other titans when they fought godzilla and kong they were pretty much useless kindai love monster verse films but this is on a another level i dont know what they could make after this thats if they even do the whole storyline is bugged up i dont get hoe they can just randomly create a new world more like life under the earth and just random portals to get in and out sorry didnt know i entered harry pottersuko i think his name is the lil ape was so cute though bless his father that scar king was a poo for killing him off like that my heart actually went for him kong was so sweet to him as wellanyways the movie was partly decent but it could have done better if rhey slowed it down a bit and not rushed it oh and also mothra what how did she just get summoned like that not gonna question but she was pretty cool as well but yeahh"
if one goes to see this movie expecting depth emotion and real cinema that person will be dissapointed if one goes to see this movie expecting wacky fun and overthetop action then you will come out of the theater with a big smile on your facethe movie has its issues like with the presence of human characters which can be a tad bit boring but the problem of human characters is less apparent than with the last movie godzilla vs kongkong is in the focus and can be considered the main protagonist but godzilla still gets a few awesome scenes the relationship between the two main characters is strangely very interesting and is well explored with this movie and the last one too even though they are both computer generated
story   proscons absurd concept and story but thats part of the charm of this action rompcast   pros hall and henry lead a charismatic cast that help push the scenes between the amazing action stevens provides some fun lighthearted comic relief to the over dramatized stakes of the movie cons characters are pretty generically writtendirection   pros wingard creates some lavish action sequences and overall creates a fun light airy tone to the film taking some creative inspiration from the guardians of the galaxy movies cons the story was the least important part of this movie but wingard really tried to push the story and the total run time was probably  minutes too long because of thispace   pros the movie moves between action sequences at a strong pace again the fights and action are the true star of this movie cons there are a few too many unnecessary character development stories interwoven between the fightsatmosphere   pros the world is fun the action is amazing the special effects are pretty stunning cons the main strength of the film was the atmosphere which is a strength for the atmosphere but a negative for an overall movie and storyoverall score  out of  very fun movie and would recommend but not a classic or quite up to the previous movies in this franchise
the latest addition to the monsterverse is quite entertaining however i wonder how long these movies can continue to be released without becoming too repetitivethe movies plot revolves around kong living in the hollow earth while godzilla is busy fighting titans on the surfacethe returning human characters include bernie played by brian tyree henry dr andrews played by rebecca hall her daughter jia and some exciting new additions such as trapper played by dan stevensthe visual effects remain impressive with incredible scalewhile i hope to see more from this universe i would love to see some unique ideas and betterdeveloped human characters
just graphics nothing else screenplay is dead you cannot connect with any characters monsters show emotions and fight like humans may be children under  can enjoy not for adultsthis not even come close the godzilla  or even the previous installation of this legendary moviesmost of the good actors are avoided because of   and as a result they get this crap movie  where an adult cannot invest or connect no emotions when godzilla appearsthese hollywood directors should see godzilla   you dont need super graphics or lot of monster scenes  its the buildup that is important
this movie pretty much overexceeded my expectations because i knew from the trailer that it would be «over the top» but as a fan of godzilla and kong they did a really good job it was really entertaining i didnt want the movie to end i wouldve given it  stars if it wasnt for too much focus on the humans they kind of killed my vibe id rather watch kong punch a wall for  minutes than watch this iwi girl that doesnt speak be the hero in this film for future movies even if there is one i would love to keep the directors from pushing this stupid story about some iwi kid i want to see monsters fighting thanks
godzilla x kong the new empire is wbs th year in its franchise this film was less about godzilla and more about kong godzilla had only eight minutes of screen time and the storyline surrounded kong as he is aging he is longing to find more of his kind and somehow there is a portal to hollow earth where all sorts of prehistoric creatures exist much like the show brea kong finds himself not alone but cannot find his place amongst his own kind he ends up fighting battles against skar the gorilla while godzilla is helping humanity fight against titans the two team up to destroy skar and bring order to his new kingdom kong represented the good in humanity while skar was the worst part of human habits and cruelty besides all the cgi and all the monstrous roars were overpowering the movie just too much with less human involvement rebecca hall acted as a head of monarch while her adopted daughter who is played by kaylee hottle is trying to find her place in her world brian tyree henry is the only person that reprised his role from the previous film alex ferns played a military officer much like his character from andor dan stevens acted as trapper an s type character in a style like a g i joe figure overall it was an okay movie with a good premise but i wouldnt watch it
watched in imax d gotta say movie is not up to the mark boring plot some scenes are good featuring kong rest is just pathetic and please remove all humans from these movies their stories really sucks action scenes are ok teaming up kong and godzilla seems like wtf not convincing at all story of iwi tribe and the girl seems so forceful and really take audience intrest away from the movie it would be far more better if do not show humans at all in the movie through out the movie i was expecting something interesting will come but it completely disappoints overall its not up to the expectations
"this film is basically showa era in cgi and this was still good humans were kinda meh godzilla was barely there and you can clearly tell kong is now the main characterwarning spoilersmothras entry was not explained much its kinda like
mothra has been revived and she will fight with godzilla again theres not really that much build upskar king is my favourite monsterverse villain so far shimo was a powerful womanscylla was killed way too early same with tiamatwheres maddison im just askingthere are  new monsters in this but im not gonna explain themoverall nd favourite monsterverse filmgo watch it if you havent"
this film would have been great if there were no humans in it they are just there to react to stuff the ending was also very abrupt it had a lot of potential the visuals were stunning same for the cgi in my opinion kong shouldnt be here it should just be a godzilla film scar king didnt do nearly enough to warrant being a scary villain shimo was also spoilt very early on which ruined the surprise mothra should have been in it from the start or set up earlier godzillas new design is a great reference to the heisei era very cool overall the film was underwhelming and minus one was better
less than mediocre monster movie with terrible visual effects the story is absolutely stupid and the ending is obvious halfway through the movie the ultimate monster fight is anticlimactic and dull the writing is lazy i cant even come up with  words to tell you why you shouldnt waste any money on this movie its not even a good summer popcorn movie its not fun its not cool kong even has a heros journey ffs and needs a damned powerfist and help from pink godzilla and frozen godzilla to get the job done the ending doesnt even jibe with the lore revealed in the movie watch this at home and dont waste any money
the movie was pretty action packed along with some plot mishaps and deus ex machina moments cgi effects were top notch although i felt that some of the actual human acting was poorly done at bestsome of the actions of both godzilla and the humans on the surface contradicted their actions over the past two movies it just seem contrived and out of placethe movie was okay just about  minutes too long i doubt that i would watch it again either at the theater or at home i think the problem was at times it bored me with the disjointed plot and the titan fights that occurred off screen
one of the best things about godzilla vs kong  is that godzilla and kong both had actual personalities which elevated the movie above your average mindless kaiju flickunfortunately this is where godzilla x kong the new empire  comes in short while kong is given a decent character arc in the film godzilla more or less gets shoved off to the sidelines this time around one thing thats also missing from the previous godzilla vs kong is the scale where the destruction and mayhem caused by the rampaging kaiju monsters dont have nearly the same level of impact as in the previous movie probably because a number of fight scenes take place in hollow earth instead of in one of the earths citiesaside from that the new empire still succeeds at being a pretty entertaining kaiju flick with a satisfying amount of actionfilled monster bashing
after releasing trash after trash with exceptions the movie industry finally blessed us with a good film dont get me wrong its definitely not the deepest storyline and there are issues but its pretty fun regardless the action is by far the best part of the film both godzilla kong and scar king look amazing the other titans are okay and they manage to tell a story through multiple characters which cant even speak which i would say is a winfor some criticism i will say that the sizing was kind of inconsistent like sometimes kong looks smaller than in other scenes etc etc but its not often also i do think that a lot of the plot points were kind of ehhh like convenient i guess but overall good movie
with a story plot so bad that you feel that the  plus people who died in just rio de janeiroin alone it were the lucky onesthe obvious cast of dei also know as cheap unskilled labour in hollywood hires include horrible single mum how has  phds time to run monarch despite not being the boss all while not caring for her daughter and insults her deaf along withe the audience repeatedly by saying she is perfect no one with a disability wants to keep their disability the daughter who comes along to one of the most dangerous places known to man and her bad mum is like ok and is now psychic saviour from an old prophecy a vetinarian that would of failed veterinarian school and is somehow also a pilot because the token while male is filled with anger and wont listen to the dei hires so they fed him to a tree the token black friend who was brought on becuase they think outside the box but only films everything for his podcast oh and token white guy who is a rage filled stuck up stuburn pilot because that what the dei writers think all white people arein the end i half expected dinosaurs to pop up since the story and humans were so bad but like the story i was thoroughly disappointed the human free cut when it comes out will be a little better to watch
godzilla vs kong  is one of the best movies of  the narrative is impressive and stays true to the original japanese comic the idea of kong facing his own kind and eventually liberating them is an unexpected and fascinating twist the collaboration of godzilla mothra and the ice titan along with spectacular action scenes in several major cities around the world offers an impressive audiovisual spectacle additionally there are hardly any dull moments which enhances the movie the improvements to kong and his aged appearance make him even more realistic as a fan of this saga i can say they have done an excellent job in creating this title
it was fun to watch in the cinema i thought the cgi was cool and good i slept a little during part of the movie because probably i was so tired  i think the movie does what is expected monster battle is also satisfying for those who want to watch the monster fight again the people in this movie are boring the acting wasnt bad there will probably be a sequels of this series it attracts my attention it is fun and enjoyable to watch in the cinema it was also enjoyable to watch because the cgi was good godzilla sleeping in colosseum reminded me of my cat wanting to sleep wherever he wanted and made me laugh king kong was very cool but godzilla was much cooler
why people have to make humans the most idiotic characters one good argument is that it is an idiotic movie i agree that it is but it is what it is i really liked to write those above phrases with a lot verb to be in the presentthe humans could have been totally left aside on this movie they bring nothing to the table they are so pathetic thats beyond belief not a rare thing these days in hollywood moviesthe cinematography is ok the monsters are ok but its a souless movie you dont care about anyone or anything turn your brain off and watch it when you just want to pass time
spoiler heavy i almost gave this a  just for that one scene where kong picks up that little guy and starts using him as a weapon lmao sorry for the spoiler but that was so funny to me in a good wayother than that yeah its a cgi monster fest with less subtlety than s just like how all the sequels have stripped away the subtle awesomeness of the first film in the current monsterverse but there sure is a lot of action and once you accept the premise and suspend your disbelief it is definitely worth the time its very fun doesnt take itself too seriously and knows exactly what you want from the movieanother great part is when kong is trying to tell godzilla to get in the hole and godzilla just suplex him into the pyramids good times and some kid in the theatre had the audacity to say that the movie was boring except for the last part at the end if a  year olds attention cant be held by  hours of nonstop king kong and godzilla action then maybe our society truly is on the brink of disasteralso at the end kong truly becomes king i see what they did there and i love it
this is not a godzilla movie comparing it to minus one is just not a good comparison minus one was a godzilla movie this is very much a kong movie with a guess appearance of mothra and godzilla which is cool he was pink which is new but little to no time was spent on godzilla fights with other monsters and in the final battle he is just more of an after thought then real player in the fight for a kong movie is was pretty decent i like the exploring of his world and monkeys are fine but the bad guy monkey was not intimidating wasnt a fair fight really i felt like mecha godzilla was the better bad guy in the last movie screen time was more even on the last one fight scenes lasted longer and better done this one seemed rushed or badly edited maybe a smaller budget this time enjoyable movie just take godzilla out of the title as its a kong movie love seeing mothra
how many monsterverse movies will it take for legendary to understand we want more monster action and better human charactersgodzilla x kong the new empire is the th entry in legendarys godzilla and kong universe but like the movies that came before it the new empire has the same problemsnone of the characters are memorable much less relatable and they still take up a lot of the runtime godzilla minus one proves you can have a healthy balance of wellwritten human drama and kaiju conflict but legendary prefers to take the turnyourbrainoff approach which doesnt work theres so much exposition that even the characters had to guess what was happening in the movie itself because nothing made any sensethere are moments of uninterrupted fights between the titans which are fun but they are few and far between there are dozens of monsters from tohos lineup at legendarys disposal but instead they opt to create an uninspired and notsomenacing threat at no point did i ever feel like anybody was in dangerspeaking of godzilla he was an afterthought for no apparent reason i loved kongs story and even the addition of baby kong had me more excited than any of the human elements of this storythe new empire was a nonsensical slog that had some fun action scenes between monsters but offered nothing else the script is contrived and the lack of godzilla is criminal yet part of me hopes this franchise continues and improves
dont go into this movie expecting some christopher nolan level compelling storytelling this is a movie where you can go to turn off your brain and enjoy mindless monster action and fan service and let me tell you theres a lot of fan service and i love itgxk does have its narrative problems such as jias character arc and the plotyou know that one cgi shot of godzilla in the trailer after he awakens from the ice that everyone and their mother is talking about how bad the cgi is yeah that stays the same its not some unfinished cgi its literally the final result the official thing but thats ok since it only lasts for a few seconds and in the next shot the cgi looks fantastic as usuali wanted this to be more of a godzilla movie but i already know that its going to be centred around kong before going into this movie because the trailer makes it obvious adam wingard is a fan of godzilla but gxk did not have a lot of godzilla well there is but kong gets way more screen time and hes the main character this is definitely more of a kong movie not a godzilla movie but im okay with it and i hope the next one focuses and centres more around godzilla or another kaiju that is not kong like rodan and oh let me tell you i would be celebrating if a rodan centred storyline is announcedthe human characters are likeable and by human characters i mean only trapper and bernie jia in the beginning acts like the stereotypical cliche lonely high school teenager who doesnt want to talk about her problems avoids it as much as possible and is the outcast who has like no friends but that gets quickly overshadowed by the monsters who have more screen time that ever trapper and bernie im glad they gave the monsters more screen time its more fun and entertaining one of the humans will have a character arc and ill just say that it couldve been betterenjoy this movie for what it is what its supposed to be a dumb fun monster movie with a ton of action fan service and loreim wasnt sure what rating to give this movie but i settled on  so people can know that this is not everything everywhere all at once this is not the dark knight this doesnt have any compelling storytelling this is an entertaining monster movie that does what would make michael bay still successful if he just did this instead even though  is a bad rating i would highly recommend this movie for people who just want to see big monsters fight and especially for godzilla fans and i dont mean the people who think they know everything about godzilla and what every adaptation should be like just because they watched minus one and liked it no offense to minus one fans because basically everyone whos seen the movie loves it but ive seen critics compare this to minus one which just doesnt sit right with me
the film itself is quite fun the fight scenes between monsters really got me excited however the human characters in the film are most of the time very boring to follow the script ends up forcing too much in several moments for example  the chosen child things that have never been mentioned before in the film appearing out of nowhere to solve a problem which makes the script a bit lazy i also think that godzillas character should have more scenes in the film the work focuses a lot on kong and kodzila ends up not being shown as much but its worth highlighting considering that the main focus is on kong and his kind apart from these points the film is really fun the fight scenes are great and very creative
we all here for that titan fight that we promised will get right well if its that stuff we talking about than this movie already doing their job with outstanding way no really but its pretty gooddespite all the gigantic fight and the all out war we kinda see through what the last fight are going to be thats because this one really put obvious step by step fight process which i really cant tell was it good thing or the opositethe rest you gonna pretty much realize that the effort mostly go to the big guys so the ground scene its self its hanging on the tip of what in the world do they plan to with the stories
this installment came out flat and stayed that way the story isnt compelling and its mostly built around kong not godzilla and the deaf child she of course is precious but she can make up for only so many shortcomingsthe cgi are great so no one will be disappointed in godzilla or kong kongs new tormentor another giant ape wears a snakes spine wrapped around his shoulders as if a bandolier from a mexican western all he lacked was a sombrero dan stevens of downton abbey and beauty and the beast fame is totally miscast as a monarch veterinarian and rock music plays during some of his scenes that is nothing but distracting and annoyingthis movie tries to be too hip for its own good its the weakest of the warner broslegendary godzilla movies it has the unfortunate fate to follow one of the best godzilla movies ever godzilla minus one and doesnt come close to capturing the same grace beauty and storyline i almost got up and walked out which i have never done in godzilla movie but stayed with the king until the end
the makers of this second journey of kong to the hollow earth and godzilla from southern europe to south america to finally meet and team up to counter a clear and present danger to us all have succeeded in instilling a heart and soul into the widespread use of computergenerated imagesjia the young girl able to communicate with kong through sign language brilliantly played by deaf actress kaylee hottle was the key force in the fourth installment of the monsterverse she remains the character who guides us here too in a formatted world to which she does not belong before returning to her origins while helping kong to fulfill his destiny with the help of powerful or touching new alliesi was lucky enough to be able to enjoy this roller coaster ride through the worlds of our earth on a very big screen and i highly recommend it its a perfect family film which will appeal to both young and old who have managed to keep a part of their childs soul tell me who didnt play like this with their toys when they were a kid  dreaming of what we can now discover on our screenif the new empire is as successful as expected i hope that legendary pictures will produce another godzillavskong film of this quality in the years to come
gxk was a great time at the movies so good i had to go and watch it twice this movie isnt the smartest or most intelligent movie but its definitely entertainingthe monsters are big loud and full of heart the story doesnt slow at all its full paced from the very start and doesnt let upkong is the heart of the story and he is the life of the storymothras return is an exciting one and the human characters are the lest annoying of the franchise which is a bonusthis entry is up there with my favourite monster verse movies it slots right behind godzilla king of the monsters as my favvery much looking forward to the next instalment
what a horrible movie i have no other way to put it this film should get a rotten tomatoes score below fiftyive read reviews saying the first godzilla vs king kong movie was a movie about humans where some monsters occasionally showed up this was a movie about humans and monsters acting like humans and the only real monsters no human characteristics are rarely seengvktnes story is seventy five percent about kong twenty percent about the human characters and five percent about godzilla the movie itself is sixty five percent about the story and thirty five percent about the special effectsninety percent of the kong storyline is about humanizing the monster and follows an alltooworn out hollywood trope that is used to humanize nonhuman characters build sympathy in general and create to build a bond with the audience for me it did the opposite it made me hate kong and wish that godzilla would completely devour him and end this pitiful seriesthe humans story is equally hollywood cheese of the four main characters one is completely pointless i think was supposed to be comic relief but couldnt even do that one is so shallow that we have no bond with them whatsoever one is so predictable that you can almost quote their dialogue without having even seen the movie and the others story arc is predictable but well acted and sympathetic and was ten or eleven years old when the movie was filmed so kudos to kaylee hottle for outacting every single adult in the moviei dont want to give away any story spoilers lets just say it is very predictable it is sad how predictable hollywood has become watching the movie anytime you say to yourself oh i know whats going to happen you will be correct it will be exactly what you expect there is not one unforeseen plot twist or surprise in the entire story not onei live in asia and watched this movie in a d theater for those of you unfamiliar with d it is a d movie with seats that move updown pitch yaw and vibrate air blows at you water splashes in your face there are over  scents that are released and there are strobe lights in the theater this is all to enhance the moviedo you remember that scene from the hobbit where the dwarves galdalf and bilbo escape the elves in that river chase scene that scene was created for one reason only to show off the d capabilities and to make people who paid to watch the movie in d feel they got their moneys worth i honestly felt there were scenes in gvktne that were shot just to take advantage of the d theaters if you feel there are scenes that seem a little  odd  chances are something cool happened in the d theater it wasnt that cool trust me
a movie for anyone who wants a kaiju fight without human intervention a monsterverse movie with the most kaiju screen time and featuring lots of kaijuforget about anything and just enjoy the kaiju fight really entertainingapart from godzilla minus one which focuses on the human horror drama of godzilla monsterverse presents a different godzilla film monsterverse focuses on action adventure battles between monsters both are films with different presentation purposes so they cannot be compared if you want to watch monster fights watch monsterverse if you want a film that focuses on terror stories monster dramas are godzilla minus one
the movie is good watch it on imax for wonderful experience of seeing the titans in more better ways story wise can make much better and can be improved they need to clearly concentrate on enemy sidemaking the strong enemy and overcome from that trouble is more better then normal story skar king character can make more strong so while movie audiences will think how this titans gonna overcome this enemy but in this we dont feel the strength of the skar kinglooks trailer shows skar king more dangerous but in movies that notvfx cgi are mind blowingdont miss this opportunity to watch on big screen kids really enjoy this very well
this godzilla x kong feels more like a kong film than a godzilla film and its sad to see godzilla being treated like a side character in his own filmi hope from next film onwards there would be a solo godzilla movie that involves the actual titans not these stupid monkeys we got in the gvk and gxkgodzilla can keep up with shimo but almost lose to a monkeykong just to please the western people is so pathetici was so excited for this movie and i watched it but i came with disappointmentwe need godzilla solo movie from now i hope this is the last movie that involves monkeysgodzilla king of the monsters is the best film followed by minus one and godzilla 
going into this movie you pretty much know what youre gonna get which is a bunch of fantasy creatures or kaiju battling it out the thing i like most about this movie is how little it takes itself seriously and im glad it was this way this movie is nothing like godzilla minus one with the captivating characters of the movie and heartfelt scenes the reason why it doesnt have to be like that is because its just an action packed entertaining blast this is the kind of movie that you can just have playing in the background and not have to really invest yourself into in the film there is a lot of kaiju scenes which really is what made this movie if youre not into fantasy creatures and colossal fight scenes then dont bother with this movie because the plot of the human characters is lackluster thankfully they show equally as much if not more of the kaiju then the humans which really redeemed this movie overall a fairly strong installment in the kaiju universe thats worth watching
the film stars ok unfortunately it seems some time it gets lost and suddenly your watching a planet of the apes filmmost notable are the visuals and the theory of the hollow earththe most irritating it seems weve seem this kind of story thousands of timesstill cannot understand why destroy too much monumental and ancient structures it will be not too much to destroy for the future in case they decide to continue the seriesand the most funny as written before it gets the apparently you are screening at the beginning  different kind of films king kong and goddzilla by its side and suddenly you jump to planet of the apes finishing seeing a curious george film d
forget a wellcrafted story adam wingards godzilla x kong the new empire feels more like a hyperactive kids imagination on overdrive imagine an eightyearold hopped up on candy smashing action figures together and roaring with glee thats the energy of this moviewhile wingards previous godzilla film embraced the campy fun of the oldschool monster movies new empire goes allout delivering a wild cartoonish adventure thats like a visual toybox it might not be the smartest film but its guaranteed to be a blastthe movies big showdown features a chaotic zerogravity battle between multiple monsters some with energy blasts and one with an unexpected weapon while such a spectacle might have been unbelievable in the past its clear the studio went all out here with a whopping  million budget this is in stark contrast to tohos godzilla minus one which had a much smaller price tag of  millionbig budget movies lately have been all about special effects and established franchises demanding the audience pay close attention and participate in online discussions godzilla x kong flips the script who cares about complicated backstories or building the world this movie just wants you to have pure dumb fun watching kong beat the snot out of other giant apes with a tiny ape clubthe monsterverse movies from warner bros havent quite hit the mark since  theyve tried and failed to be serious and adult godzilla by gareth edwards focused on dark human drama instead of epic monster battles  a mistake kong skull island by jordan vogtroberts tried to be like apocalypse now but missed the mark godzilla king of the monsters by michael dougherty aimed for fun but ended up dull and hard to see with all the smoke who needs realistic physics in a movie with godzilla king ghidorah mothra and rodan give us the monster mayhemour giant ape hero is looking worse for wear hes sporting a dad bod and a gray beard constantly harassed by creepy monsters and worst of all suffering from a nasty toothache thankfully dr ilene andrews and her daughter jia are there to help they even brought in a charming monster vet named trapper to address kongs dental woes these two human characters are a highlight of the film managing to deliver even the most ridiculous lines with complete seriousness
this movie is an abomination an insult to all of us who grew up watching monster movies hollywood took the most archetypal monsters and not only changed their essence it changed its role its motivation its form its universe this insult against our history must not go unpunished first they turned king kong historically a giant gorilla attached to blondes into a friend of children and defender of humanity they made with him what gamera was at the time then they took godzilla he went from being the king of the monsters to simply becoming king kongs partner to defeat potential enemies the insult didnt stop there they transformed mothra an enviable enemy of godzilla into a key defender of humanity the aberration was adorned with a choral cast where all races are present making the experience even more vomitous the plot is indefensible nothing has logic nothing has coherence the past is not honored nor godzillas music nor the mystique of the great monsters that marked our lives those who made the film should go to jail for this attack on the positive side is a welldone fight sequence that adds a point to this humiliating painful and daringly fatal experience
i love all things godzilla but after watching the trailers for this one i was not so sure mini kong was a big red flag for me however that part of the story was well donea big positive was the somewhat limited parts the humans played yes there were some cringe moments like how a dentist knows how to pilot a high tech craft the acting was pretty good and the attempts at comedy were tolerabledisappointed that the story was  kong and less godzilla although the kong story was pretty good but could they not come up with a better name for the villain scar king reallyi was hoping godzillas enemy would be destroyah that would have been epicthe end battle was okay but not greatseveral people in the theater were clapping so i am not alone in liking this onei will definitely buy the bluray
first a little mini rant ive noticed a trend that actionsuperheroeffects movies tend to have a d release with a few notable exceptions there seems to be no reason for it there are a lot of really cool potential effects that the filmmakers could use to make d worthwhile but they usually end up not using the so please stopok so on to the review this movie is a mess put more truthfully its really two movies theres the monster movie of kong fighting a tribe of ancient enslaved apes with an equally enslaved ice monster the godzillaantigodzilla concept was actually kind of cool godzilla fighting the titans and wrecking havoc on world cities and mothra bringing order and balance to the whole then theres the human movie of discovering a lost and quite advanced civilization that unites jia with the people she thought she had lost oh and shes a messiahsavior figure to boot  who would have guessedthe monster movie is fun as you would expected and again heres where the d effects would have done in really handy and been really cool  lost opportunity guys its really stupid and nonsensical but run to watch rome and cairo and the pyramids and rio get tromped on by godzilla and the other beasts in this case theres little to no dialogue or acting needed so its pure actionthe secondary discovery of the lost civilization movie had real potential since it was nestled inside the monster movie there was not really enough time to develop this so it felt rushed and perfunctory this could have been a sort of underground pandora with again lost opportunity cool d graphics but because this is really a monster movie the action jumped back and forth between the two sometimes with scenes of humans trying to track godzilla why it makes the movie kind of a disjointed messthe writing and acting are stupendously bad  terrific waste of some really good talenti would have loved for this to have actually been two different movies the origin story of the telepathic iwi how they ended up in the uncharted second level underground layer of hollow earth and the story behind their apparently special relationship with mothra would have been really and could have made up a full movie or even franchise in and of itselfultimately its got the same appeal of a missionimpossible or fast and furious movie sometimes you just want to go see things get blowed up
how can i say this movie have everything i call generic american movies are more focused on bringing more cgi effects and transformers stuff than a good story surreal stuff happens and they react like yeah thats normal pretty basics and that kind of stuff you know in the middle of the movie i almost praied to end that i gave it a  not to give  theres nothing i can say it is very good everythings generic and now they bring the sound effects of transformers now think dont waste your time and money and wait to see on internet even so you need to think on that minus one is by far better than this
fantastic fun movie made me laugh and even made me feel more for kong though godzilla is still my favouritethe side characters were really enjoyable but did not overwhelm the movie kong had a good arc which made me enjoy him more as a character the characters that turn up later in the movie also had their turn around moments and i hope shimo gets more screen time in the next movie shes a really cool monster with a great design and hope they explore her character more in the future this movie was a joy to watch and is not depressing or polarising like a lot of movies these days they need to make more fun movies like this one
i left the theater feeling stupid but yeah i expected that what i didnt expect was that kong could get a toothache and godzilla now can run and jump and what material is kongs robot arm made of it didnt get a single dent after the fight with other titans and dont get me started on godzilla getting an upgrade and becoming pink after killing another titan who never even antagonized him i guess the villain is not too bad but the humans are utterly useless while its not as bad as monarch the tv series which is a snoozefest its still not good the only decent monsterverse movies in my opinion are the first godzilla and kong skull island the others in the franchise are just dumb theyre not unwatchable or anything but just dont expect too much i gave it a  because i didnt feel like i wanted to leave the theater early
the script is truly rubbish the scriptwriter director and the studio really treat their audience as if they have no brains and it is a real lack of respect sure they are monsters fighting but still the simple fact of how what is happening is described is seriously the worst thing i have ever seeni cant believe they actually think the public agrees with whats happening humans only appear to explain things to you that dont make any sense gozilla sleeping like a cat in the colosseum is simply lazy writing kong with a toothache really made me feel so cringe that i couldnt take anything else seriously this movie is simply bad
 stars for visual effectsthe actors are completely out of range its cringe its dated its unoriginal the music looked like it came from another movie the script is nonexistent it was a pure horrific nightmare to watchi really wanted to gave this movie a chance but the movie let me down completelythe script itself was lost in its story there was no explanation whatsoever we have some scenes that were already seen a zigabillion timesoh and its a happy ending for our heroes of course but lets not talk about the fact that millions of people were killed when titans kong and godzilla are fighting in the middle of some citieswaste your time with this movie if you want to truly comprehend how we can still make movies already seen with no heart in it
love to see pink little bit disappointed for the little fight scenes expect to be more fight scenes amazing hollow earth views hollow earth is a mystery love to see more godzilla scenesand fight is rather a cameo more should be there but still superbly entertained and kong oh so powerfulhope next movies will be good or expecting even better than this one we would love to see a solo godzilla movie in which he will be seen more and there should be more fight scenes and more powerful titans lastly hats off to the producers again for the amazing portrait of the hollow earthhope we can see more of it in upcoming monsterverse movies
"what in the guardians of the galaxy avengers infinity war god of war planet of the apes avatar mishmash did i just watchstupid over the top and ridiculous is godzilla x kong the new empire the only question i have is what ideas didnt they cut from what i imagine is a pool of stupiditybut this is exactly what i expected fun stupidity and while it was fun it just wasnt as much fun as i wouldve hopedthe film opens up to some great titan action and then things just stop in the second act focusing way too much on the boring human subplot godzilla is unfortunately wasted and not properly utilized i appreciate them showing how hes charging up his power but then he only has it for like five minutes when he spent literally the whole movie charging it upfortunately things do pick up in the third act with some great action however it was underwhelming and just ended too fast if they spent more time on titan action and less on the boring human subplot then they would have had time and wouldnt have needed to rush the third actthe film was beautiful thankfully and surprisingly the d looked really good i normally dont care for d but for some reason all the showings today at my local cinema were in d onlyoverall while this is better than king of the monsters i dont think its better than godzilla vs kong irregardless all three of these films are painfully average to below average anywayso if you can turn your brain off to all the stupidity and stomach some boring human drama then im sure godzilla x kong will provide some popcorn eating entertainment this holiday weekendimdb 
letterboxd watched in theaters"
what i you want from a warner brothers godzilla  kong movie giant cgi monster fights dont get me wrong godzilla  was great but thats a different monster literally samuel jackson ken watanabe elizabeth olsen millie bobbie brown rebecca hall all great actors love their other work i dont care about their collective back story  family drama when it gets in the way of giant cgi kong  godzilla  monster fights this is the warner bothers version finally done right from literally the opening shot its a giant kong monster fight followed by another giant cgi monster fight followed by another and then another every  maybe  minutes tops spaced thankfully very sparingly with just enough human narrative  exposition to keep the movie humming along with just enough plot and then yes get to the next giant cgi monster fight which all dahliver in glorious imax d dont waste your time seeing this in anything other than imax d its not going to win any awards other than special effects godzilla  and it should win that in a walk away the effects are spectacular in imax d and they had the audience i saw this with standing up and cheering
the movie was awful if you liked the  version and especially king of the monsters this is a cocomelon version of any of those shimu is a huge disappointment scar king has attitude monsters dont need human emotion stop destroying good characters by making them more humanyoud think these directors would learn do yourself a favor and dont pay for it wait for it to come out youll be glad you did just wasted  on tickets and another  on snacks for a horrible movie even my teenager thought it was stupid and im an optimist lol wait for it to come out for  and have  of your friends come over for a dollar and maybe the one that likes soap operas will enjoy it
i felt like this movie had no sense dialogues vere missing there was no engaging story like  of the movie is sounds of screaming monkey and screaming godzilla previous one from  was much better i watched them in cinema on the marathon and one after another oh my there was huge difference  movie had more sense in sake of story shooting in this movie the plot is chaotic and is not very engaging if someone wants to go to the theatres just to watch fight scenes i guess he will be satisfied but personally  i wasnt important thing is that i am not a huge fun of this franchise but valid point is that the previous version satisfied me much more
i just finished the movie though it has a fast pace from the previous movies but you will be amazed by many shots and new monsters godzilla being bad ass daddy and kong being the family guy to watch then is very cool you will know about some great back story of titans and you will now able to connect dots and also there are many cute awww moments also one thing you may not like is how fastly things will happen here and there and you kinda wanted to see some more actions in fight scene but it is ok you will be able to see how humans and titans are connected and some important role of humans in this battle
the tropes the cliched characters the story another girl boss how did this get made the script is awful the acting is as bad as the story and its boring so very boring youve seen this very same plot characters and situations multiple times i saw this after godzilla minus one which was excellent and true to the subject matter while this is anything but it seems to have been written by school children for school children and they still would have been disappointed hollywood will keep making this type of horrible nonsense while people pay to watch it i cant see anyone older that early teens enjoying this i sure didnt
godzilla x kong a new empire is my new favourite monster flick dont listen to the critics who give it bad or mediocre reviews it takes everything great from king of the monsters and godzilla vs kong and adds so much more its quirky and entertaining like skull island i watched it in cinema in dx it was the perfect movie for this with many explosions and great fight scenes that drag on but keep you stimulated with vibrant astonishing and groundbreaking vfx such as godzillas supercharged radioactive beam it incorporates a lot of confusing but exciting science that sometimes bored me and great vibes of mystery the science fiction and wonder is great the bizarre but chaotic plot had me gripped and enthralled with emotion and amazement  but some brainless moments too i think the film is basically just a kong film with a bit of godzilla spice its like avatar plus planet of the apes i must say godzillas final form was a bit underwhelming i think minus one and shin godzilla did better but it was still astonishing and i liked it overall i loved it and there is much more to say
i am not a fan keep criticizing every small imperfection of movies from scifi or fantasy worlds i liked the last godzilla vs king movie and i liked the monarch show on apple tv that said this latest movie is definitely not a movie i would watch again not even if i am bored on a transcontinent flightthe plot is strange im feeling the basic idea is to let kong and godzilla to be friends and give kong a kingdom so he could be the king kong i can also accept the idea of underground world of the hollow earth if you take the hollow earth as another world rather than the literal inside earth crust but how the heck did godzilla seal the scar king in there and how the hell did the entire ape world become a slavery tribe and they had to introduce another godzillatype of monsters in there to even the play field and the setup that governments have no pieces in the hollow earth is just laughable ok ill bite but arent there many visible portals around why did the scar king stay put until one of his henchmen saw the temporarily revealed portal from the not so hidden tribe and i think jia was cute in the last movie but her presence and the entire underground civilization setting is just w t fstill remotely entertaining seeing monsters fight and all but this is definitely a very much downgrade from the last few movies
i went into this movie just wanting to see big monsters hit each other theres definitely a lot of fight instances however i found myself disappointed by a lot of them most of them were one sided beat downs some of which lasted seconds i thought maybe its okay because we are building up for one big epic finale fight but that also felt very one sided and as a result a little boringimportant to say the movie definitely had its moments there were some good laughs and enjoyable moments between godzilla and kong there was enough to make me smile that made me not rate this lower unfortunately the negatives outweighed the positives for methe inclusion of godzilla in this movie did not quite feel right he was kind of just there and almost just a plot convence and to pull people into the seats by having him in the title the main focus is on kong which is not a problem but you would expect to see a little more than a few very quick scenes of heres where godzilla is nowthe people scenes are the weakest parts of the film not that interesting the comedic relief is not that great and some decisions seem nonsensicallastly i am a firm believer of the suspension of disbelief and just accepting the rules of a movies world i am super annoyed but this blue stick that magically controls the other big bad with absolutely no explanation other than he uses pain to control itoverall if you are looking for big monster beatdowns where theres little tension and no fear for the heroes then check this out
 out of  starsgodzilla x kong the new empire is an awesome monster film that delivers a great sequel to the monsterverse having kong and godzilla team up to battle against skar king a giant ape who is bent on escaping the hollow earth to take over while kong will need all the help he can getplot is great the action sequences are exciting and a wild ride the visual effects are great adam wingard direction of giving it a special colorful lighting does a great job and the music score is also very promising the cast ensemble is great too the human characters are more on the side lines while the monsters take majority of the screen time with a destructive battle the villain was great there is also a surprise with the team up as kong and godzilla fight against the bad guy and another titan appearance is fun toothis film is just awesome in every level that is worth seeing on the biggest screen
i dont know is it difficult to produce a great film these days i dont see anything interesting watching this movie the story is very boring and the events are not very interestingthe actors are not professionals its a copy of the previous movie if you have watched the previous version of this film you will see the same places and the same effectsdont waste your time watching itis clearly not that interestedi dont know if the producers of this film care about viewers opinions and ratings or if they only care about the money but i know that in the previous version there were very bad reviews to the film and they did not pay any attention to it they produced a film worse than the previous versionplease stop making parts for this movie it has become very boring
now i know this movie is not gonna win everybody over but it hella did for me this is the most entertaining monsterverse film so far not  minutes go by without a monster fight and that is really what everybody is wanting from the king of the monsters and the th wonder of the world right ofcourse the movie has many flaws as usual the humans are the worst part of the movie but they are a improvement over milly boby brown from the last two and really the main character of the movie is kong himself tho being a godzilla fan it did hurt to see godzilla be kinda shoved in last second but he is still in it a good chunk of the time and i know that godzilla minus one just came out and i know it was really good but thinking that is good and this isnt just is not right they are two completly different movies and have no right to be compared to eachother and godzilla is such a flexable character he can work in a gritty world and a campy fun world and i am so glad that we live it times were we can have both kinds
went without a lot of expectations but was still a bit dissatisfied by the end the visuals were fine but the story seemed to be a randomly collected mess of tropes mind you i have never seen any other godzilla or kong movies the sort of mystical people who were unknown to anyone just honestly didnt add anything to the story here they werent fleshed out and fell flatgot to see some cool titans tho thats always cool all the running and screaming humans added nothing for me tho somehow i would be curious what the story could be if we removed it from the human world completely i kinda want to see kong just explore the hollow earth and discover things on his own without the chosen one child there
seriously b grade animation akin to video game graphics a patchy storyline and oddly enough better acting from the cgi characters than the real oneslike someone who jumps off a bridge into water hoping for a rush i too was disappointed to find out it was way too shallow to dive intoeven the camera work was poorly framed and the storyline was vapid at best i think everyone can agree when they created baby yoda they birthed a cute and likeable character that people wanted to see more of but even the jump the shark effort of introducing baby kong falls shorter than the life that was left in happy days
godzilla vs kong the new empire is what i went to see at the movies i had a lot of fun with this movie i found it to be an extremely entertaining monster movie where you dont have to think too much just like that just let the flow of images wash over you and entertain you as i said i had so much fun with the movie why did it work so well it is a tribute to legendary monsters and great apes cgi was used a lot but it was well done now thats what i call style for once monsters roared properly on the screen this was like it was made just for me like a video game come to life in front of your eyes on a big screen fantastic the movie made me smile and laugh thats what happened this time the movie did its job one a big surprise for me the story was thin it must be said but it basically didnt matter at all one of the best movies of the year
an unengaging and boring film there are a few sequences with king kong that feel as if they could be from a far superior film tragically they are not godzilla has perhaps five minutes of screen time he is shoehorned into a king kong movie the cgi on godzilla is inconsistent and never as good as minus one which is embarrassing considering the budget also some of the other monsters have very poor cgi as wellnow what about the humans you ask well they take up a fair chunk of the film despite being incredibly uninteresting and boring and annoying at times as well the writing is mediocre and primarily comprised of expositioni feel like this movie played it safe it never truly went into over the top dumb fun modeinstead it just straddled the linenot worth the price of admission
this movie is awesome i happen to be a godzilla fan so im not coming into this not knowing anything i really loved this movie my family and i were all excited for the last year and then the first trailer hit my wife myself and my kids were so pumped the cgi is amazing yes sometimes the sizes can sometimes change but they talked about this in kong vs godzilla they made choices so it fit better with the movie which is so fine i am not about to judge it for thatanywhoooooo the movie is so fun it could be really bad but with the cgi and the story it keeps you watching we all had so much fun i love how godzilla turns pink and just the fights they knew what we wanted and gave us what we wanted as fans and it loooks frrriiiiigin amazing i love this movie exceeded gross expectationsthis movie is so fun yes its no oscar movie but hell yeah its a popcorn movie my kids and i were yelling kick hisbutt lol it was great
the  godzilla was enjoyable but not great the most common criticism was the habit of cutting away from the monster action as soon as it became interesting but that wasnt the issue the real issue which has been expanded on with every theatrical followup film is the fact when they cut away its to underdeveloped characters that either have no personality or an exaggerated tropefilled personality aka look at me im an interesting character because im flamboyant and loud and kookygodzilla x king the stupidest title yet takes that to a new level the human characters are cartoons with no resemblance to real people that i might care about unfortunately i also dont believe any of the monsters are real because the cg and animation are also cartoonish and therefore not good enough to sell the suspension unlike the th budget godzilla minus one and unique shin godzilla those films also illustrate another problem with the hollywood versions the monsters are way too big they clearly subscribed to the bigger is better mindset but it makes them even more difficult to take seriously as living organisms since our brains default to basic grade school science that tells us such things couldnt exist due to their own mass the monsters in the others are already on the cusp of that suspension so going bigger is definitely not betterthe only interesting and engaging characters in the legendary monsterverse are in monarch legacy of monsters
i always switch on the sequences in video games when i want to play them myself at least that was the case with my last game about  years ago but if you like watching that youve come to the right place theres also product placement blockbuster nonsense michael bay aesthetics further exploitation and perversion of the basic story the only central content seems to be the question of which metropolis is being destroyed by a keyboard i cant find any reference to its predecessor which is typical of this type of film turn off your brain take in a flood of images maybe be reasonably entertained for the duration lose a dozen brain cells remember nothing a day later although a memory can also have a negative impact the whole hollow earth nonsense was already bananas but the body modification in kong tops it all again somehow you like this kong throughout the film at least he doesnt mess that up but its still  million trash
one of the best movies of the monsterverse the body language portrayed by the monsters really add another layer to the film each main kaiju is spewing with personality specifically with skar king being cocky  kong having empathy even the humans were goodthis sequel is proof that with great vfx and body language the cgi monsters themselves can tell a story with no humansskar kong is easily the best villain in the monsterverse imo his arrogance and cocky personality is fun to watch on the screen especially with how he mocks king kong his movement when fighting is very fun to watch he doesnt respect his opponents
cant say that i even remember any of last titans film plot not that it matters to anything this is a movie that you can go and watch without knowing a single thing about a single plot detail sometimes it could be good but as far as it goes with this mash up of godzilla and kong it is not a good factit is the classic film for the viewers to click on the button of ignoring large details of it and not pay attention to the amount of inventions that holds no grasp in the real world just come to see a bunch of monsters fighting each other and let your brain take a leave to a vacation of almost two hoursthe plot is not even a thing here we are talking about a giant ape with a giant monster an underworld that is so beautiful and havent been concurred by the human race yet and a lot of collateral damage that even several wars can cause to that is being ignored for the sake of the films plotthe human characters are plastic and are for the sake of exposition storytelling and narrative building nothing that they do is not contributing to our understanding or enjoyment from this film it seems that this movie producers are not interested of harnessing their audience to anything but blows and crashesregarding the epic and exhausting battles  i found myself sleeping and rewatching them several times a fact that cannot serve well the movie from my side they looked unreal and were so repetitive that it was starting to be boring much more than exciting it is nice service for monster films but not a good movie to each and every actual movie fans

with monsters that exist only to fight each other and characters that exist only to explain why the fights are happening godzilla x kong the new empire feels like an elaborately expensive wwe eventthe soundtrack feels like it came right out of a year olds playlist with barely any of the songs having any meaning to what were seeing other than to turn up the fun factor that little bit more the story can best be summarised as big ape and big lizard vs evil big ape and misunderstood big lizard with every scene and sequence featuring humans that lead up to the fights consistently crank up the ludicrous levels of overexplanation as to how any of it makes sense the monsters after all this time are put front and centre with kong leading the charge the effects look on par with the previous monsterverse entries but the fights are far and beyond superior with understanding of gravity and physics traded in for hilariously stupidly entertaining punching matcheson the other hand a lot of the actors kinda look like theyre clueless about what theyre doing but are decent at selling the absurdity although i liked dan stevens the most but i didnt really find any of the characters that interesting the jokes are the same inoffensive streamlined humour that plagues modern movies and therefore the only laughs youll get are from the monster fights or stupid science jargon that doesnt make sense the new empire itself too is more like an ancient empire so i gotta ask whats wrong with the title godzilla x kong the old empire and for a movie that headlines kong and godzilla there really isnt that much godzilla and that monster kinda feels more like a side character than a coleadthis is a movie that isnt really supposed to make sense and is by almost every sense of the term a popcorn flick an easily digestible blockbuster movie it works purely as switchyourbrainoff entertainment and nothing else
for as long as box office sales skyrocket production companies will keep making movies off the same concept over and over again its time to let godzilla and kong resttheyre as tired as the movie plots its a very weak script not so great acting from rather decent actors were talking veterinarians who fly in on helicopters playing whats supposed to be cool music to repair kongs rotted tooth come on the storyline jumps all over the place with very little screen time for godzilla this was really painfuleven the climatic music made it hard to care if you feel compelled to watch it wait until its out on netflix
godzilla x kong really learned from the past movies and made a smash hit with this onei spent some time the past week catching up with godzilla king of the monsters and godzilla vs kong those were decent in their own respects but the first suffered from too much dialogue and human reaction shots while the second had a sort of haphazard story strung through to make the matchup happenin this latest installment of the monster verse we get just enough story to push our humans and monsters along into an increasingly grand and interesting adventure that keeps on delighting at every turn we get to see new discoveries about monster background and legends naturally without it being spoonfed and we get so much action there are a variety of monster fights left and right and each battle makes sense in their own context theyre really fun to behold and they do a great job mixing things up to keep you guessing as to what will happen nexti went in not expecting much based on the past ones and even a bit hesitant thinking it was mostly going to be about kong and relatives based on the trailer but it generously exceeded my expectations and im glad to have gone on the ride i feel like transformers could learn a lot from this team on how to make giant things fight in a really fun and interesting wayi would say dont think too much about where were going or how we got here go with the monster flow and youll have a great time with this one
i think i have my own movie rating system the best movies are those worth seeing at the cinema and paying full price and overly expensive snacks the next below is a matinee at the cinema followed by wait until its on a pay channel and eventually regular tvthis is where this movie belongs it could quite possibly be the most idiotic movie ive ever seen the giant ice turtle hiding behind the lava waterfall the signing child with the mute tribe its a cgi messbut the most ridiculous thing of all is the hollow earth tv the best part of it is the worst part of it the cgi is very good but much like most movies today theres too muchkudos for sneaking a little kiss and badfinger in it thats how it got the second star
this movie was just epic my only cons about this movie is of course the human characters but the final battle felt really short and i feel like skar king and shimu couldve done way more then they did in this movie but just the utter action and kaiju fights in this movie just completely overthrow my cons one of the best parts about this movie was just how much action there was dont get me wrong i felt like the final battle couldve had way more action but with the amount of kaiju fights we got its understandable y it was so short considering the movie was only a hour and  minutes overall godzilla x kong the new empire was a fun action packed monster movie and i really hope they do more with the monster verse down the line
i cant believe godzilla vs kong has lower rating than this godzilla vs kong was well written acted tense and interestingly developed from the beginning till the end i didnt even know there was going to be another sequel because the last one had the great conclusions and ending series were just fine as some side piece about the whole backgroundall in all this film was just soooo disappointing if the targeted audience are children below the age of  and eventually some people who love cheap thrills idk who is supposed to like this cheap scenario and terrible acting rebecca hall was a disappointment in this role a great actress fell this loweveryone was acting terribly and that veterinary dude was particularly annoying i had the urge to punch him in the face the whole time as i said in the headline a waste of money this is please no more sequels leave the godzilla alone let him sleep peacefully in the colloseum this has become a disgrace to the beautiful titan characters
"following the quite good godzilla vs kong godzilla x kong continues the monsterverse storyline with an overcooked boullion of monster nonsense
plot awful the writers just seemed to pull stuff out of a hatscript see abovecgi and visual effects are overall terrible and not up to todays standards at all king kongs expressions and movements and even godzillas are too human theyre movements are too fast and theres not really any sense of scale even when they are shown against the human cities they just dont look anywhere like the behemoths they are supposed to be when the fights are happening the hits dont feel like they connect the background and world building looks shallow and especially the subterranean world just looks confusingnice obvious product placement of a volkswagen car probably others but i had gone beyond caring too muchacting well there is some but the writing is so bad i couldnt criticise the poor people who had mistakenly decided to be in this moviemy kids more target audience than me liked it but werent massively impressed"
die hard fan of monsterverce i give  out of  the cinematography is outstanding the goosebumps grow up when skar king came out i see this movie in theatre dhindiif you dont see godzilla vs kong so you not feel the craziness stly i say you go and watch godzilla  and kong skull island then godzilla vs kong then you see the godzilla x kong the new emperor fully action and fighting scene but if you are a godzilla fan so a sad thing godzilla come here at the last but king kong is the lead monster mainly  monsters are new the skar king simo  the little kongdirector adam thanks to give us a great vibes after  years and also warner bros and tohocoi wished you guys love this monsterverce new emperor
was expecting something completely different more along the lines of godzilla minus one but this movie was the chirpy bubblegumandunicorns version aimed at telling young adults confused teens why yes you sure can if you only dream hard enough mildly offended by the obligatory asl deaf child who could at least and not like mom actually sign i have to write another  characters about how this movie nearly gave me diabetes just from watching it but i am finally running out of necessary words i need to post this review to the site because you cant obviously say anything worthwhile with less if you dont like the review then dont put the idiot word requirement in that or get a project manager with a working brain
godzilla x kong the new empire was an amazing movie with so much action the whole plot with scar king and shimo was amazing my favorite scene was when the got to rio and the music slowed down and shimo jumps out of the ice at first i didnt like godzillas design but it was amazing though the finally fight was a bit fast there where a ton of fights to make up for it even thought kong was the main focus you could definitely feel that godzilla had a huge presence when he was on camera and i loved his spiral ray probably my favorite beam out of all of the godzillas scar king was a menace but he was weak and besides the godzilla vs kong fight in eygit it didnt feel like there was much plot armor over all 
this movie has every stupid cliche ever with the only difference being its got giant monkeys instead of people the human characters are awful theres an australian guy trying to be starlord who i really wanted to see get smashed by a truck or something paperboy trying to be nerdy and funny and failing miserably the woman who is only there to explain all the dumb stuff going on through exposition and the little mute girl has the emotionless facial expressions of a sanded cantaloupe the plot is basically good kong and fire breathing godzilla vs bad kong and ice breathing godzilla the soundtrack is annoying and thinks its being hip and cool oh and the evil monkey can control the evil godzilla using magic crystals
terrible garbage i mean my son is  and loves these films like he has toys and many more he was disappointed at this the film starts as the most confusing irrelevant garbage ever and a huge time skip the silly tribe gia girl is always sad and annoying pracically  mins of godzilla screen time and some useless kong things of pulling faces and some tribe it completely destroys kotm and skull island im interested kind of in this lore as the useless kid we just knew is apparently some prophet and the movie disregards mbb characterway to fast paced and the hype for the villian that was useless and has  impact on the story pulls up on some dragon which is huge and a walmart godzilla ruins it could of used the movies previous plot exploring skull island being destroyed by ghidorah or even ghidorahs skull gets its own body the film is terrible and the fight is mid hense the stars the fast paced action which is throwing rocks and annoying human characters would i buy it on skyno
"dont care about human stories in these movies
i couldnt care less who lives or dies
all i care is more action more monster fight i really want a good fight between kong and that other kong again they should have made that other kong more powerful like an equal fight between him and our kong
all and all waiting for the next movie ang all i want is more fight
godzilla king of the monsters was phenomenal so many monsters so many fights
loved it
loved this one too
these are the only movies worth every penny when watching in theater the next monster is powerful lets see how godzilla going to handle it"
i dont even know where to begin expectations were low and this movie went below them i wanted the monster fight scenes to even out the horrible plot i was expecting but everything was just bad there was no suspense no build up no much of leading to anything the fight scenes just come and go there is absolutely no satisfaction from any of them except the very first one when the credits are playing random plot elements are just added randomly throughout the movie its like off road driving but not exciting nor thrilling  what a waste of money this wasnt even a good kong movie easily one of the worst attempts at making a movie that ive seen
amazing movie fast paced intriguing better than its predecessors all of the fighting scenes among titans are too good visuals are stunning storyline is not bad might call it satisfactory and my god the antagonist titan the scar king so villanish movie mostly focused on kong and throughout the movie godzilla just evolving must watch movie but if you hadnt seen previous monsterverse movie you might get bore or confused movie feels like it should have runtime it feels short may because it engages you throughout the runtime just having the vibe of infinity war you will enjoying the movie throughout the run only if you had watched all the monsterverse movie
the title is pretty much my entire review and i could go on at length but will do so only because imdb now requires a certain minimum number of characters for reviewsif you like the effect of sniffing glue and licking a  volt battery while headphones at maximum volume are duct taped to your had by all means this is the film for youif you prefer your godzilla movies  as i do  without smirking ridiculous attempts to manipulate the audience or mysterious tribes and giant monkeys somehow knowing american sign language pass if you prefer your godzilla movies like i do with interesting monster fights and not weird clearly cgi screeching motivationless slap fights pass if you would like godzilla not to be wandering around aimlessly for no apparent reason leaping whole time zones in a matter of seconds passotherwise its great
doesnt make any sense at all no story k just rotating the story from east to north and north to west without connecting the strip graphics are good and have some good fight scenes but story is below average things happen out of nowhere without prior explanation or connecting the storyline wasted  hours of my life on this useless moviei dont know how this movie could have  starts how they create the portals how they move from spain to egypt to italy or whatever only if they have worked in building the story and it would have make any sense but it seems like they were only selling the name not story i would never watch any of this series film ever again
to recap this movie is made for people who wants to loves monsters fighting each other rather than drama full of explicit sex and nudity a bad ending the symbolize cinema only to lead people with more depression walking out of theater and comparing a movie that also appear from the same franchise im looking at you a a dowd godzilla has been a fan service since the showa era and this delivers it also doing a comparison like calling minus one is a majestic while godzilla x kong a productbruh those both movie are a love letter to a monster and minus one also a product also andrea chase i think it will be better if theres any other director who make a movie about a monster hitting on world trade center rather than plane and then calling it as cinematic and tragedy also if godzilla  didnt get a positive review than godzilla minus one will never be made thats all see ya
title reimagining the monster epic a critical reviewupon witnessing the latest installment of the legendary monster saga one cant help but feel a sense of utter disappointment coupled with a profound feeling of having wasted both time and money the lack of a coherent storyline leaves viewers grappling for substance as godzilla finds himself engaged in battles with primates and diminutive reptiles comparisons to its predecessor only serve to highlight the stark decline in quality with the first installment offering a far more compelling narrative in that film the protagonists faced off against the formidable foe of mega godzilla a worthy adversary that lent weight to the conflictwhere the first film managed to captivate audiences with its gripping tale this latest iteration falls short failing to provide any semblance of a coherent plot viewers are left struggling to comprehend the disjointed sequence of events as the film careens from one lackluster battle scene to another even the godzilla films of the s often criticized for their campiness boasted more coherent storylines than this latest endeavorone of the most glaring deficiencies of this film lies in its lack of compelling fight scenes gone are the epic clashes that characterized its predecessor replaced instead by uninspired skirmishes that fail to elicit any real excitement or emotion from the audience where the battles in the first film felt weighty and consequential those in this sequel come across as mere spectacles devoid of any real substanceperhaps most damning of all is the fact that even the muchmaligned godzilla film of the s managed to offer a more engaging story than this latest installment despite its flaws that film at least had a narrative arc that kept viewers invested from start to finish in contrast this new entry in the franchise feels like little more than a hastily assembled cash grab devoid of any real passion or creativityin conclusion while the allure of witnessing giant monsters battling it out on the big screen may be enough to draw some viewers in those seeking a truly satisfying cinematic experience are likely to come away disappointed with its lackluster storyline and uninspired fight scenes this latest installment of the godzilla franchise fails to live up to the standards set by its predecessors instead of offering a compelling narrative and thrilling action sequences it serves only to squander the potential of its rich source material as fans eagerly await the next chapter in the saga one can only hope that future installments will return to the roots of what made the franchise great in the first place
godzilla x kong the new empire i was very hyped for this movie since it involves two of my favorite movie monsters king kong and godzilla tag teaming against some other monsters you couldnt go wrong with that could you well albeit the movie not being bad by no means it also wasnt perfect but it definitely was as good if not a little better than the godzilla vs kong movie again i dont get the low ratings but that is what that is i will stick to my own feelings and i say i actually liked this movie only downside about it was that it focused a bit too much on the humans which is just getting tiring now from these monster movies i mean come on i wanna see monsters fight not some humans talk and talk and play the stereotypical heroes that gets boring real quick the only two great kaiju movies i can mention that mixed the humans and monsters thing perfectly is peter jacksons king kong and pacific rim off the top of my head anyways for me this was a  rating but that might be because im a huge fan of kaijumonster stuff
horrible simple one of the worst movies i have ever finished after  minutes i wanted to leave the theater but stayed anyways for god knows why the acting characters etc are amongst the worst out of every movie ever made the character development like with the little deaf psychic girl was just as bad if not worse the only reason this review isnt a  is because of the pretty cool monsters and the last fight scene which was cool to watch as the cgi is pretty good in this movie the corniness however drags it down so goddamn much it hurts please to anyone reading this save yourself the money and trouble and do not go watch this movie ever
in the colossal showdown between the towering godzilla and the mighty kong the stakes are skyhigh but the pacing feels like a runaway train while i appreciate fastpaced movies this one left me breathless its as if kong and godzilla were sprinting through scenes barely pausing for a breath the film balances its focus between humans and titans but the scales tip unevenly the human side is wellexecuted especially with the endearing jia who communicates with kong using sign language however the titans deserved more screen time i craved deeper exploration of their ancient rivalry and the mysterious hollow earth the plot serves up basic meat and potatoes monsters duking it out but heres the twist its been done better before back when men in rubber suits stomped miniature cities the writers occasionally hit a creative roadblock tossing in convenient plot devices like kongs bionic exoskeleton arm or mothras unexpected peacemaking gig the action sequences deliver the expected adrenaline rush but the cgi wobbles at times characters unfortunately fall flat  bland and forgettable and despite the films title godzilla feels like a cameo in his own showdown skar king the villain lacks the menacing presence we crave the music generic and samey like a playlist on repeat but hey its popcorn entertainment  adjust your expectations accordingly godzilla vs kong the new empire is a middling affair neither soaring nor sinking its a monster mashup that leaves you craving more substance amidst the spectacle
"i saw this movie yesterday and i wasnt sure what to expect but i must say this movie was outstanding and i loved that the cast from godzilla vs kong  was in it i did not realize that it was a sequel to the movie godzilla vs kong 
there is literally nothing bad i can say about this movie and it was epicfrom beginning to end the storyline was perfect and the cgi was incredible through the whole movie you find yourself rooting for kong and when godzilla and kong come facetoface it awesomeif you have not seen it you absolutely should i have it  stars 🌟 with no hesitation"
godzilla x kong the new empire  where do i even start so weve got kong and godzilla apparently the only two linkedin connections left who havent ghosted each other teaming up again because you know the real estate on skull island just wasnt doing it for them anymore and apparently theres a hidden airbnb for monsters in hollow earth theyve just discoveredthe storyline ha imagine taking the concept of logic throwing it into a blender with some monster movie clichés and hitting the puree button until everythings just a wild incoherent mess thats this movie its like they thought hey how can we top the last level of absurdity and just went for it by the end youre half expecting the monsters to pull out lightsabers or start quoting shakespeare wait theres this remote control ice knife which is almost a lightsaberthe script oh its definitely the work of an ai i refuse to believe that a room full of actual humans looked at this script and went yep thats it thats cinema its not just illogical its a masterclass in throwing logic out of the window and then nuking the site from orbit just to be sure and the mysticism its like they googled how to add depth to a movie without actually adding depth and just ran with the first search resultbut lets talk about the real stars of the show the monster fights because nothing says box office hit like turning the most beautiful cities in the world into an allyoucanwreck buffet for giants its visually stunning in the way that only complete and utter destruction can be you cant help but admire the sheer audacity of it alland hey amidst the chaos the movie passes the bechdel test so in between watching ancient titans play demolition derby with world heritage sites you can bask in the glow of minimal gender representation small victories rightin conclusion godzilla x kong the new empire is the kind of movie you watch when you want to turn off your brain question the existence of coherent storytelling and just see big monsters go smashysmash on each other and famous landmarks its so bad its almost good almost
seeing kong befriend curious george the mini gorilla or orangutan and seeing godzilla attain super saiyan rose was a great thing there were a bunch of moments when i thought man i want a screen saver of that also a whole whole lot of great fight scenes mainly my gripes would be with godzillas under utilization because after he got more power he kept missing his shots over and over again and as youve likely already seen the main characters are weak as always with the exception of trapper being a great addition other than that tho if you want a good time passer and great action id recommend this onealso curious george for the win 
i dont recommend this little flick to anyone whether youre a king kong fan or godzilla fan in fact if you used to be fans of godzilla and king kong you wont be anymore after watching this movie what did you expect from a movie with a gorilla and dinosaur that cant have dialogue a lot of missing holes in the plot the character development is bleek the pop out scares are unexpected and the sad story of it all is the one character that is supposed to have development has a total of  minutes screentime the main villains arent even godzilla and king kong even though they fought eachother in the last gig the main villains are real sad duplicates of godzilla and king kong and dont live up to the hype and get wiped real quick
a fun romp through the inner earth with many a kaiju fight and some very fun and engaging sequences but the film is solely that fun which in it of itself isnt a bad thing but films that are only fun are usually forgotten quite quickly and what is remembered is usually some select sequences of action or peril but the overarching plot and characters are quickly forgotten amongst the many actions sequences that are far more engaging than the characters and plot this is the type of film one puts on to turn off your brain and watch a big monkey and lizard fight things and cause damage nothing wrong with that but it leaves much to be desired in any other regard
i love the effects in this movie godzilla kong and all the creatures in this movie are all cool and dont look like marvel cgi abominations which i appreciate the acting was pretty good by the human actors i really liked dan stevens ace venturalike character he was chill and i would like to explore uncharted territories with him brian tyree henrys character was a little bit annoying but he wasnt the grating comic relief in these sort of films henrys character was alright this movie features asl which is cool godzilla was awesome kong was awesome all the kaiju were awesome all the creatures were awesomewell thats my review go see this movie its great
i dont necessarily feel compelled to write a review of godzilla x kong the new empire as it seems that most reviewers have already echoed my thoughts the monster battles are cool the human element is not however and much to my displeasure while watching this film i even found the action to be underwhelming  and believe me i never thought id say thatgodzilla x kong the new empire seems to be giving viewers what they expect  audience scores are strong and word of mouth seems to be positive and i am honestly more than a bit shocked by that considering that in my opinion this film features the weakest action scenes of the series by far sure if you enjoy this type of film  and i do  there is enough creaturefeature cgi spectacle to quench your kaiju thirst in fact there are prolonged sequences of just kong or just godzilla as they are going about their business and that was a nice touch when compared to previous films that focused almost solely on the human characters but while this film does increase the focus on its titular monsters it somehow has the least amount of action when compared to the other installmentslisten i enjoy watching godzilla and kong fight to the death as much as the next person thats all i was really looking for here so imagine my surprise when the first real action scene takes place around half way through the film imagine my surprise when the main villain is the least intimidating looking and acting monster known to hollow earth imagine my surprise when the climactic battle between godzilla kong and the main villain was underwhelming and way too short lacking the sense of immense scale that was built up so carefully in the other movies in this franchise i mean i dont really know what to say  the action was just missing something and so because the action was so sparse and lacking what was i left with you guessed it the human charactersi dont even want to waste time writing about the human element in this film because you already know that its as boring as boring can be i like the actors well enough but their reliance on cheesy comedy brought the movie down for me especially since i just didnt find the comedy all that funny additionally and as usual the film does spend the majority of its running time focusing on the humans which meant that for a majority of the running time i was very very boredgodzilla x kong is fine its not a travesty but its really not all that good either there is some fun action but in my opinion it was all too little too late but who knows maybe in the next film theyll learn their lesson
im a lifelong godzilla fan and i did enjoy the movie but  spoilers its a kong movie featuring godzilla id let this slide if it didnt show godzilla constantly powering up throughout only to steamroll kong who didnt wanna fight briefly only to be knocked out by him and be dragged away  then he wakes up and is interrupted by mothra sure kong had a mecha type arm but a regular godzilla should overpower kong all day let a lone a supercharged godzilla how the hell do you let kong knock him out after all the buildup godzilla was basically powering up to fight ww and this movie lets kong ko him although briefly  shouldve never had that in the movie kind of ruined it for me
godzilla x kong is a movie that stands just slightly above godzilla vs kong in its inherent quality characters have better characterization plot is slightly more coherent kaiju moments are roughly the same etcthe visuals themselves animation fx cinematography and compositing have gotten much worse the monsters often range from mediocre theres an attempt to abhorrent animation cinematography for these kaijus are generally low quality and overall compositing of the shots are often abysmal being the worst cgi and cinematography of the monsterverse any resemblance of what godzilla  and kong skull island had is lost in favor of humans in suitsstory itself is decently set out where a lot of visual elements are used in kongs scenes which is executed nicely even though a lot of concepts or exposure of concepts remain underutilized or underdeveloped it allows kongs story to be understood without the explicit need of humans to lure kong around unlike gvk godzillas story is very interjected at random moments lacking very little presence throughout the entire movie until the third act the actual worldbuilding implications in the ape colony and the hollow earth is a huge step upwriting and characterization is generally lower quality with some okay moments that steps up from gvk exposition is done too many times and too much as opposed to showing or implying things with less exposition characters are generally better but a lot of dialogue and writing seems surfacelevel where each scene functions as the this establishes the trait this person has as opposed to spreading out the personality in a realistic waypacing is very rushed given the short runtime where the movie would benefit from having more drawnout moments allowing pacing to breathe naturally given the content provided this also plays into editing which overall is okay but the editing completely falls apart in the final surface fight the weakest part of the movie where it goes by very quickly among bad editing cinematography etcost is simply bad paying very little respect or never matching the tone of any scenei hope for the next movies to be a significantly better film from a story and writing perspective and from a visual perspective human characters need to be better and comprehensible and writing should feel natural and not forced the series shift from the more serious tone to a lighter tone is jarring but the more problematic aspect is the decrease of filmmaking quality all across
the worst movie monsterverse ever made improper size scaling successfully wasted three titans in a single movie a titan like tiamat was one shot by godzilla skar king who was trying to act like a badas villain in the trailer was nothing but a tennis ball for godzilla and kong the first titan shimo who was stated to be responsible for the previous ice age on earth was not able to freeze mere kong after watching the trailer i thought shimo would be a threat for humanity but they literally made her kongs pet the all over movie was silly and childish and also releasing too much tv spots destroyed the hype for the movie
this by far has had the bestmost action yet it was so enjoyable had some laughs throughout it worth the  year wait in my opinion it did feel a bit rushed i was hoping itd be longer but non of the less it was a perfect return for are favorite protagonistss i also wished the film was more godzilla focused the gmans fights felt hella rushed but in a good more reasonable and awesome way making him seem like a true king and an unstoppable force for what would come later for him in the movie hoping adam wingard gives us more films like this i might personally go watch it again but in imax 🔥😁
"i seriously thought this one would be awesome one but no so many mistakes cheesy story no explanation for what so everso many scenes that doesnt make any sense seriously im lost for wordsits just sad to know that this movie could have been one of those awesome monster movies that you even buy a dvd version of just in case so you could always watch it but sadly in this case you se it once and never again ore put it in the category  movies that help you fall a sleep faster
imagine all the workers that busted their ass of to make it awesome but in the end it was just waste of their precious time and energy i fell sad for them"
i love kaiju movies i grew up with them and they are always fun godzilla mothra gamera i was there for all of themthis movie is great but i found the humans really annoying they did not contribute anything not the story and in places actually slowed it down in the original japanese movies the humans usually helped the story forward and added drama this cast added nothing at allthe action with the monsters was excellent and the special effects were great i am also adding an extra star for the music as wellthis is a fun movie with plenty of action but a really forgettable cast is this one of the best kaiju movies not really the classic movies are better but this was entertaining and i am happy with that
please dont waste your time and money watch this nonsensejust monsters fighting each other and making so much noise i couldnt wait for it to get overthey could have made the storyline interesting there was no suspense just utter stupidity they had like  different monsters there was no excitement and so boringit gave me a headachethe worse movie ever of the movie these silly monsters just fighting each other and try to kill otherjust a little bit of humour here and the main heroine was goodi had gone to the cinema after ages and never have i complained about any moviebut this was pathetic
i left the theater after watching gxk feeling the same way that i felt after watching kotm  just not surei had hope since godzilla vs kong was a good turnaround for the monsterverse but this was slightly disappointing the previous films had huge spectacle and amazing cgi and this film falls shortfrom the first few scenes the cgi was questionable and looked almost cartoony and the script is a complete dumpster firewhile i do appreciate the cheesy battles there were almost too many when the final battle came and went i found myself pretty underwhelmed the battles leading up to it seemed biggeri get that theyre trying to draw in a bigger audience and demographic but this movie just fell short for me unfortunately there are some really pretty shots and good camera work but the movie as a whole you can tell its the cheapest monster verse film to dateand is it just me or did they reuse a lot of the same music from godzilla vs kongill still buy this as soon as it comes out and its definitely something that you could see and enjoy if you havent watched any previous installments
a group of scientists uncover a mystery about skull island and must unravel it before a situation with godzilla and kong get out of handan enjoyable monster verse film i mean i like the way it tries to humanize godzilla and kong and the effects are always great but i admire the way the film doesnt spend too much time on godzilla and kong cause rebecca hall brian tyler henry and dan stevens all have there moments to shine and they are every bit as enjoyable has the monsters dan stevens steals every scene hes in wont be surprised if he gets his own spin off movie the monster fights are also great
"thomas tull once had his name and credit attached to one of the best popular movies of all time he said its ok if we lost its director we have found a replacement on the man who direct  that shows how much he knows about films and about moviesthe first director went on to make oscar winning films like inception and oppenhaimer while the second one directs and army of rebels to losing millions and tull went for producing crowdpleasing masterpiece with nolan to ruining his legacy with trash as this onesure its making money by the cannibalization of dune  biggest screens but its also the worse king kong movie i ve ever seenat least its not the worse godzilla movie ever at least
the only good thing in this movie is the way its handles telepathy so as to spare us of more bad dialogue"
"when me and my friends went to see the movie i really enjoyed it but friends went over the moon for it they gave it a solid  so for the audience that doesnt want anything serious  this is hella perfectthe story wasnt anything new that we havent seen before but it serves the movie good my biggest problem with it was the human characters just like godzilla vs kong the characters are flat and i would rather watch monsters fight than them vfx
 story
 fightsthe previous godzilla was better but this one is not really disapointingyou should watch this movie in d by the way"
this movie is entirely kong focused with little to no development for godzilla just they need to stop the kong agenda they are just showing him as a mindless beast who just attacks his rivals its becoming worse of they want the monke to be the main focus then just dont include godzilla in that for gods sake at this point they are using godzilla as a marketing material for their movies and nothing else it will be nice if japanese got the rights to godzilla and make movies than hollywoodpeople will compare this minus one cause it is the best movie out there with everything lol they may cry but they cant deny the fact
godzilla x kong the new empire in my opinion is better than the previous film because of how it wants little else than to entertain you and have fun it is filled with so much monster action and cool visuals and has a light campy feeling where i couldnt help but have funspeaking as a huge godzilla fan i loved a lot of the little references to godzillas past and even how some of the fights in the movie both reference  i wont spoil anything for hardcore fans like myself but i think that you will enjoy the nods to godzillas past there are some crazy moves that kong and godzilla pull off in the film that make both laugh and think that they are coolthe only reason i am not giving this  stars is because the human characters in the film like the other films in the monsterverse fall a bit flat but thankfully their scenes arent very long and the monsters get just as much screen time as they and all their scenes carry the film there is still more of a focus on kong in this film but im okay with that because his scenes are entertaining and when godzilla does show up in the film and towards the climax it is pure bloodpumping action from there on outi would recommend this film if you have liked the other monsterverse movie or if you are a big fan of either godzilla or kong or even better both
i went into this movie with an expectation of surpassing its previous movies in the monsterverse in terms of storytellingnew monsters and even bigger fightsbut all i got was a brainless godzilla getting angry every  minutes at someone and a very weak villian with a wasted potential giant called shimoi was bored as someone was fighting someone every  minutes and the story made no sense and the editing between the human interactions were too fast and choppyi think i wasted my money on this one and am highly disappointedthey should not make another one unless its as good as skull island or the first godzilla where we could feel the intensity and seriousness of both of these giants with the mystery they carried on their faces and movements
i hope nobody is actually looking for a deep thought provoking brainy movie because this is not why you go to see a godzilla film its pure popcorn entertainment full of explosive action titans fighting and wrecking everything around them without a care in the world the effects are good battles are entertaining and they keep the monkey brain in a state of total joy throughout the less than two hours duration yes this one doesnt suck  or  hours of your life and doesnt waste your time that alone is worth paying for the ticket haha nerds will enjoy it kids will be in awe and your inner monkey will be satisfied grab some popcorn a cold beer and have fun
horrible i want the time back i wasted on this movie its like godzilla and kong meets planet of the apes and how to meet your dragoni love kong and can tolerate the godzilla movies but come on now what the hell happened with this movie the synopsis sounds good but in reality its a freaking mess they should have stopped with the last godzilla vs kong moviejust noand what is up with the giant butterfly  bee i think i must have fallen asleep half way through or my mind must have blanked out half of the moviethe cgi looks cheap and weird af half the time it looks like a game i wouldnt mind playing if there was nothing else to play on planet earth but it doesnt work as a movie for mewhat a waste
the lack of diolog was very disapoiting also it moved so fast and to say there were some lacking graphics is an understatment some of the mosters looked like plasic and had no shading i would usaly be fine with this exept for the fact that it was with a main charicter i wont spoil also a few times there would be something throughn and it would have no effect the only redeming quality is the fights these are desenyly good also im clnfused on how its only ph there were some brutal deaths chariters being crusher riped in half or crushed by massive bolders there were also some crigey scene aswel as a sopy one at the end
in godzilla x kong the new empire everything deserves praise the performances of the cast especially the one of hottle soundtrack cinematography visual and sound effects direction screenplay action sequences and ending are all great and have nothing to be said against themregarding the flaws the only flaw that i saw in the movie is the very simple story and some confusing story elements other than that everything else was greatgodzilla x kong the new empire is one of the best action movies that i watched this year that is why when it comes to the score i gladly give godzilla x kong the new empire  out of 
possible plot spoilersa lizard a moth and an ape transformer walk into the hollow earth king kong lives in the hollow earth while godzilla protects mankind against dragons and giant crabs regardless of the collateral damage meanwhile kong has a toothache jia kaylee hottle is the last iwi alive as kong is the last of his kind alive which is stressed too much so we know it isnt so there is a lot of fighting going on between the cgi creatures too much in fact as it grew boring the basic plot is an ice tiamut threatens the world kong and godzilla team up with a moth to save the world in an extremely long battle because no one seems to be able to die this is a kids film
i will say this is a terrible movie if you treat it as a movie where you want plot and good acting etc however i am a godzilla fan so im not here for the plot or the actors im glad the directors realize this and this movie is mainly focused on godzilla  kongalbeit abit more on kong all the human characters are for the most part enjoyable and entertaining to watch which i appreciated no more millie bobby brown trying to take focus away from the monsters its even more lighthearted than usual as legendary seems to be making it more and more mass market which is my main critique if they couldve kept the style of godzilla kom this wouldve been the perfect monster mash up overall id rate it no after godzilla kom gvkgvkg
they say it is godzilla x kong but in reality it was just mostly about kong godzilla on a logical and obvious standpoint is better and stronger than kong yet western directors of the monsterverse have some kind of fetish to over glorify kong and it was blatantly obvious in this movie it is bad enough we got so much limited screen time for godzilla who is the main character of the monsterverse while highlighting a big monkey who doesnt even have powers or relative to the plot an ancient feud with the skar king the skar kings feud was with godzillas ancestors  so its actually his fight but they some how made it about kong and kong riding off with shimo who can actually take on gojira and not to mention is like  times stronger than kong was the most laughable ploteither way its an alright movie with some really bad direction and logic that applies to the monsterverse showcased i hope they dont do anymore godzilla x kong movies cause they are utterly pointless and just a way to try extremely hard to show that kong is an equal which he definitely is not by any sense of logic
"that third act was fire a truly popcorn movie if youre simply looking for a film that features massive creatures punching each other in the face for almost all duration godzilla x kong the new empire is going to give you everything you wantsynopsis
this latest entry in the monsterverse franchise follows up the explosive showdown of godzilla vs kong with an allnew cinematic adventure pitting the almighty kong and the fearsome godzilla against a colossal undiscovered threat hidden within our world challenging their very existence  and our own the epic new film will delve further into the histories of these titans their origins and the mysteries of skull island and beyond while uncovering the mythic battle that helped forge these extraordinary beings and tied them to humankind forever"

this is a pile of rubbish i could have happily fallen asleep or just went home it was direi mean ok the cgi is great and it best be its there in every scene the humans do we care about any of these people no could they have been combined and recycled and changed totally yes cause who are they do they matter are they just there to say plot points and explain whats happening yesgodzilla hardly in it and his battles at the beginning france and arctic are all off screen dull kong well yeah ok he needs his family guess what oh look there they are hes a dad nowlook ok its fine but honestly fine isnt enough blah blah blah
"likesgood pacelots of monstersmore monsters on screen than other filmshumans werent annoying this timegraphics are goodminikong is cuteaction works so wellsummary
the latest entry in the installment exists purely for entertainment expectations and it accomplished this for this reviewer in many more positive ways than i expected it holds a good pace is fast and pushes the plot towards what everyone wants in this spectacle doing little to diverge into complex twists the humans are about seventy percent of the plot much less annoying than previous installations were when they took over the story while its mainly comedic relief the humans provide the translation to establish the archetype and help get this chaotic mess of a tale together fortunately there are plenty of monsters to help distract the new empire starting to feel like a poweredup version of jurassic world and give us the animelevel goodness this series is known for plenty of familiar faces get some time on the screen alongside some impressive use of their inclusion that ive been wanting for a very long time hollywoods graphical prowess continues to shine well mostly in this movie with sleek patterns textures and designs that keep to the characters but help add some realism to their design to help give the liveaction purpose or perhaps you are just in it for minikong whose adorable addition is one part story one part pertinence and all parts comedy as this universes grogu steals the show on a lot of aspects though not too much to rob from the other contenders and of course the action is the highlight of the movie and so good for this reviewer both lizard and ape get plenty of time to show off their moves in very impressive displays of giant mma matches its exciting its fun and it has surprisingly good choreography that has all the adrenalinefueled emotions you want in an action film the new empire excelled in that spectacle and knew a large part of what it wanted to deliverdislikesplot is full of holesneeds more antagonist build upmore godzilla probably neededstill cheesy given the rushed storytellingsome battles needed to be longersummary
now it just needs some finessing once more needing to get the story in check and add a little more composure to make it as strong as it could be its campy and corny summed up rapidly and uses a lot of conveniences to fill the gaps and put logic behind what is going on id wished it was stronger like some of the earlier films but it works until near the end when too many things just quickly fell into place with that luck only hollywood can harness my main complaint is that the movie moves a tad too fast which truncates a lot of things into micro bouts that rob some of the enjoyment for me godzilla takes the brunt of this pacing his parts feeling very limited only really being continuously present at the end of the film his battles are the ones that end rapidly and though he has quite an amazing finish in each one he just really misses some of the magic that kongs battles did better throw in those plot holes we talked about add some cheesy levels that get out of hand and well the faster pace needed probably another thirty minutes to get the full effects of the movie and me more funthe verdict
while this movie may not be the cinematic marvel that minus one was the new empire certainly gave me hope that someone understands what we want in this movie and how to bring it to life certainly the story is eyerolling at times with some of the antics really stupid and or convenient however in its place is a movie that holds a lot of the monsters fighting monsters in some of the best choreography to date in this series its animelevel goodness that was just a lot of fun all at an engaging pace that will keep fleeting attention spans happy so long as you know what you are getting yourself into certainly the pace does hurt it to some degree primarily in godzillas inclusion and chopping up the battles to levels that can be a tad annoying overall though i was very satisfied with this movie and recommend that you catch this in the theaters to get the most out of this film it may not be as artistic as some other versions and the story may still need work but it is fun and filled with feral fun my scores for the movie areactionadventurescifi 
movie overall "
i have seen this series of monster movies on the big screen i enjoy the spectacle of larger than life movies i used to automatically go to a big special effects movie all i needed to hear was the budget was  million however having been inundated with many many marvel movies all loaded with special effects ive become a little burned out also i have grown leery of movies with numbers at the end because it has been obvious studios want to cash in on the name instead having an interesting story to tella trailer for the upcoming kingdom of the planet of the apes played right before this film it shows different tribes of apes engaging in battle having no idea what the plot of gxktne was i had no choice but to notice the similarity of this film to the upcoming planet of the apes kong is living in this hollow earth world he discovers other big apes that live there separated into tribes there is fighting galore ill have to admit as much as i like the planet of the apes franchise i prefer other types of science fiction i enjoyed the planet of the apes reboot but i only can handle so much of the ape worldso here is what is supposed to be godzilla and kong with godzilla even coming before kong in the title yet godzilla only has a cameo in this outing so little as to be deceptive advertising actually humans only have a cameo in this outing as well it is really all about kong finding his place in the underworld of apes the humans briefly appear every once in a while but all they say is something is going to happen as for the special effects it definitely is quantity over quality although the movie is nonstop action a lot looks like late s quality special effects especially water effects we are used to avatar quality water effects gxktne is subparand i gotta say rebecca hall a talented actress that has a unique look does not look good in the short bob haircut in this film all the humans in this film dont have much to do except for the girl with who has the same problem as kong she is the last of her kind and feels lonely the script fails to smoothly incorporate all the elements into a cohesive story i have to admit i might be getting tired of the monster movies there is a thing as too much action i give it a  out of 
godzilla kotm was my favorite monsterverse film until this came out g x k is a fun wild ride throw your imagination out the window and enjoy it for what it is godzilla  kong in the same movie again been a fan of godzilla  years and have every movie on dvda blu ray and this one will join it soon a surprise cameo some brutal kong fights godzilla doing what he does and the monsters in this film are some great additions to the series skar kong is an interesting character to say the least im happy the past  years we have gotten  new godzilla films awesome figures long live godzilla
why do i feel like i have seen this type of plot more than a thousand times in moviesseriously whoever wrote the script and thought it was a good idea should retire from making films the plot was basic and nothing memorable the human characters were beyond useless cause they were just standing around doing nothing for more than half of the whole moviethe title of this movie is pretty misleading i was hoping for more godzilla and kong rather than seeing them in separate places for the whole movie until the last ten minutes the main villain scar wasnt even intimidating shimo had a lot of potential but they butchered her like that and what was that giant moth all about everything was stupid and boringand what new empire was shown in the movie i just laughed rereading the title of this movie again
the fifth feature film in the monsterverse series that kicked off in  with the oddly serious godzilla the new empire sees returning director adam wingard last seen helming s godzilla vs kong back in the directors chair and overseeing this newest big budgeted exercise in cgi and monster mayhem that provides exactly what youd expect from such a film and nothing more marking down another forgettable if slightly passable attempt at giving two of cinemas most iconic creations more time in the spotlightachieving far greater financial success across its first official week of release in a global box office receipt point of view empire has clearly managed to release at a time and place in the cinematic landscape where viewers are content to be taken away on a mindless blockbuster journey but its a shame wingard and his team that includes very capable performers such as rebecca hall dan stevens and brian tyree henry arent able to give us more than a film that has some decent eye candy but little elseproving even more so that the monsterverses biggest problem since its inception a decade ago has been creating a human element worthy of all the city destruction animal grunts and cgi work empire struggles in its two hour time whenever the title characters arent front and centre and without any human glue holding everything together theres only so much kong and godzilla can do especially when godzilla feels like more of an afterthought here with kong taking up most of the screentime in a titan point of viewappearing to be nothing more than exposition mediums or fact mouthpieces the journey of our central characters venturing into hollow earth that kong now calls home to investigate a potential new threat to mankind never gets out of first gear and while through this time we get to witness such cinematic greatness as kong using a minikong as a makeshift weapon or dan stevens trapper performing a very unique type of dental procedure theres a lot of downtime in empire that cant be saved by a whirlwind finale that is decent but far from the final act saviour that empire was in need ofjudging off what we see here it appears as though the monsterverse in its current format is starting to desperately struggle with maintaining narrative momentum or a reason for these crossover spectacles to exist and its hard for us viewers to look at what weve seen here and be excited about what comes next as its likely weve seen about all we can see from these behemoths over the past decadewith some strong audience sentiment and a likely healthy end box office haul theres no doubt we are going to see more of whats been on offer here lets just hope that if its to be the supports that work alongside our title characters are far more thought out and interesting as without growth in that area future instalments of this shared universe are going to get harder and harder to endurefinal say if youve yet to enjoy the modern day monsterverse its unlikely kong x godzilla the new empire is going to change your mind providing much of the same of what has come before it appears as though this series has ran out of ideas to keep it moving forward offering up some decent spectacle around a lot of forgettable and regrettable filler alive improvised weapons out of jordan and eddie the movie guys
ive been a fan of the monsterverse since godzilla   godzilla x kong the new empire is the best entry in the monsterverse these movies continue to ramp up the ridiculousness with each entry  i love itnow i will say that the monsterverse movie wer never cinematic masterpieces to begin with hell they dont even hold a candle to any of the toho godzilla movies but then again they shouldnt these movies are never going to be able to compete with the japanese movies must like with japans animation and pro wrestling the monsterverse movies are the cinematic junk food of the kaiju movies
time sinking move spoilers a movie of plot convenience characters and kaijus seem to be in the right place at the right time for when the plot need them to be take for instance dan stevens character he teleports from one place to the next and they have exactly what they need when they need it the big bad kaiju is no real threat at all the title is miss leading at the end of the movie there is on new empire to speak off it is all ways fun to see kaijus fighting and the scenes with kong are fun but i kept finding myself waiting for the next big fight which is probably the point of these movies
so while i have all the godzilla fanboys here who seem to think godzilla won in godzilla vs kong which technically he did but also kong won and in this one as well allow me to explain so in godzilla vs kong kong knocked out godzilla with his axe for about  minutes however for some unknown reason kong walks away i dont know if thats down too bad writing or direction anyway with godzilla knocked out all kong had to do was grab his axe and slice godzillas head off but for some reason he doesnt and walks away allowing godzilla to recover again this situation isnt spoken about however in my mind has kong the clear winner now in this one we see similar situation not wanting to fight kong gets attacked trying to lure godzilla into hollow earth kong is able to knock godzilla out with his infinity glove and pounds godzilla till hes out cold which means for me again kong is the winner and could have killed godzilla if he wanted too but again that wasnt the plan here the plan was he needed godzillas help so he started to drag him down to hollow earth are you getting it godzilla fans if you get knocked out first in a fight and your opponent has the opportunity to finish you off youve lost the fight again the first movie was bad directing for the fight still cant understand why kong walked away when godzilla was out cold anyway really fun movie really enjoyed it
godzilla x kong the new empire is the latest film in the monsterverse film series the film is directed written and produced in part by adam wingard who also directed the previous monsterverse film godzilla vs kongwhen ilene andrews rebecca hall and her team learn that something is wrong with kong they investigate this way we learn that a new threatening titan is disrupting the balance in hollow earth and also threatens to disrupt the balance in the human worldto keep both worlds in balance the team needs the help of godzilla in addition to king kong to do this they must reunite godzilla and king kong after their final confrontation to stop the other threatsthe previous films from the monsterverse series received less feedback that the human storylines and characters did not really interest the viewers much thats why they seem to be trying to stick more to the monsters with this new film especially king kong as a result the human characters and even godzilla in this film serve more as extrasyet these extras do have their own storylines that sometimes play into the storyline of king kong but are sometimes quite separate from it because of all these extra storylines the film can seem a bit messy at times and can sometimes be difficult to follow for a better and clearer story the writers could have better discussed their story ideas with each other and perhaps combined some things into the same thing or otherwise used fewer elements then they could have had a clearer storythe visual effects do work in the film and provide entertaining images of monsters fighting each other by having some of these fights take place in the monster world the monsters lose their great preconceptions which they had more and better in the previous film fortunately these large visuals work well when the monsters fight each other in the human world although the monster fighting scenes are entertaining they are sometimes depicted a bit too dynamically so you cannot always follow everything clearly during some fights you may wonder where some characters or monsters have gone this shows that the film could have worked well with fewer people and monsters the director and the visual effects team were given more space to make the monsters more his own in this film for example they have given the monsters new looks to make the film slightly different compared to how they appear in the other films in the monsterverse seriesbecause quite a lot happens in the film not every actor gets the same amount of time in this film this gives cast members like brian tyree henry some room for some comedic moments but others serve more as people who explain what happened the history of something or where something is currently located this can lead to more longwinded moments in the film
the new entry to the monsterverse gives kong an opportunity to reign as king while taking over a new empire and give godzilla a new sos signal to prep himself for a battle he didnt ask for godzilla rules above whereas kong rules below uniting them is the little girl who is a teen now there is more to the hollow earth this time and not just for the two monsters but for the girl as well how does the kong and godzilla learn to team up again to face a generic baddie monster forms rest of the storywhen godzilla vs kong released it was my first film post covid lockdown in an housefull theater which didnt follow the  occupancy rule and it was the first ever film i watched uncomfortably with the people around it was an experience on its own and that helped me be lenient towards the story post that and also the monarch series i am not too keen on the hollow earth thingy and the awful human stories getting intertwined as ridiculous i find them to be the real reason why i watch these films is ofcourse for the lead monsters on that front this sequel barely deliversthe film once again failed to get me invested in the human characters and the first half too didnt offer much with the kong and godzilla with repetitive scenes as well as the usual monster battle cut off just when it started to get interesting what this film does get right is by introducing the mini kong and the bonding scenes between kong  mini kong helps the first half the final battle in the second half was fairly engaging and it is here mini kong got to shine with the audience in my show opting to whistle nonstop for a forgettable sequel this film wouldve benefitted from more titan stuff and less human stuff the imax d had two close up shots of pink godzilla and kong respectively apart from there wasnt much to boast about
undoubtedly godzilla x kong will be unforgettable for me as i enjoyed it from start to finish with my entire family we all laughed and got excited with the magical elements that adam wingard masterfully conveyed in what i consider his best film to date this is unquestionably kongs movie as it showcases his more human and emotive side something godzilla will never achieve due to his primal and wild nature witnessing these giant titans facing off against each other is an incredible spectacle that demonstrates the magical power of wellmade films the directors affection for the kaijus is evident as is the improvement in the human storyline where in my opinion the human characters are not intrusive gia delivers a spectacular performance conveying her emotions without even saying a word lastly i want to take the time to thank the artists behind the outstanding cgi their dedication and passion for this great film are evident seeing kong alongside suko and shimo is undoubtedly one of the best happy endings in cinema history
too much of a kiddie film for me now moving into comic bookmcu territory an animals the size of a tall buildings moving with the speed of a lightweight boxers and with wwf moves to boot i always buy blurays and on streaming if i like the movie but on this one i will wait to see it again in netflixif at that remember the  film where godzilla and the other monsters moved and fought according to their size and weight well give that all up its an entertaining movieif you dont mind movies in the comic style also dont expect anything from the ever changing human charactersthey are flat and useless
so right away i have to say i have not seen godzilla minus one yes everybody says its one of the best movie of the year and so but i am waiting for a french dub version so i cant compare at alli started watching monarch legacy of monsters but as i write this i am currently at episode  and i cant say i enjoy it that much its not bad but there is clearly a lack of monsters in a monsters show i supose streaming service budget is the reason ill review it when im donebut basically i dont watch a godzilla or kong movie to see humans dialogues for the majority of it what i want is big monsters bashing other big monsters head and a ton of destruction and chaos and thats exactly what i got here yes godzilla x kong the new empire is really not deep in term of storyline yes its pop corn entertainement but thats a perfect movie for h at the theatre its a big cgi spectacle and its fun i just got what i wanted with this and thus i am giving it a solid  out of 
this had to be one of the worst movies ive seen in awhile godzilla minus one was amazing this not even close horrible acting bad dialogue cheesy jokes a plot all over the place overthetop cgi that looked fake and just overall boring even the fight scenes were drug out with odd camera anglesthis is proof that hollywood has too much money to throw into garbage stories but know idiots like me will waste their money to see if its good lol i absolutely hated the movie start to finishthe only reason i give it  stars instead of  is the music and some of the effects i guess i may have still been too generous with a 
it is really interesting how gojira can effortlessly traverse two distinct cinematic realms reflecting the emotionallyresonant realisticallytragic gravitas of gojira minus one contrasted against the hyperenergized fiercelyheroic guardian of nature persona of godzilla x kong where big g takes on all challengers with megaberserker attitude ecstatically jumping headfirst into every brutal fight without slightest hesitationthe new godzilla x kong is by no means a perfect film and it is probably unfair to directly compare to the nearly pristine artistic achievement of minus one however gxk most definitely exhibits ample doses of rollercoaster level adrenaline rushes throughout and the many spectacular titan battles come extremely fast  furious in fact the one criticism i have is that this film seems to jampack a bit too much acceleratedaction into its relatively short runtime i really wish more time was spent revealing the intriguing backstory of ice dragon shimo to flesh out the mythology of how shimo might actually be one of the original titans and an authentic ancient ancestor to gojira himself the bright side is that king kong and baby kong had more screen time allowing their genuine bonding to develop i also really liked jias sidestory rediscovering her hollowearth heritage and revealing her direct connection to peaceloving mystical mothraoverall i thought gxk was most certainly a worthwhile watch and i did appreciate gojira travelling back to his late showa era roots as the ferocious unbeatable guardian of earth pitted against any and all threats to humankind since it was late showa gojira that i eagerly awaited to watch as a small kid whenever those campclassic movies appeared on tv reruns destroy all monsters was a perennial favoriteit will also be interesting to see where legendary pictures and adam wingard choose to direct the monsterverse toward the future it feels like godzilla needs an alltoho teamup adventure next time bringing back rough  tumble buddy anguirus and some of the other japan allstars possibly against the heisei era villains biollante or destroyah in any case i think godzilla x kong provides more than enough hyper creativeenergy bursting with ample excitement and adrenalinerush entertainment value to justify many more monsterverse outings in the future
not sure why i even saw this as ive not liked any of these movies except for skull island but i was told it was so bad it was good and was unintentionally hilarious so i checked it out for a laughunfortunately though its not so bad its good its just not good though it is slightly better than the other bad movies in this series the bads still outweigh the goods here the action and effects are cool and there is actually a story of sorts but with brian tyree henry back as the annoying comedy sidekick the movie still doesnt have anyone to really route for throughout all the carnageits story is all building up too a big fight of a finale which is awesome but still has all the issues these movies have all the destruction feels like its not really effecting anything and the unintentional laughs feel odd when the intentional laughs just arent working
finally ive been waiting for it ever since i saw gvk and im just extremely happy because its what i wanted from my point of view it has everything the monsterverse has been missing so far that is the total monster showi have noticed that some people now say that everything is happening too fast now they have twisted and say that you need more human story and so far even the human stories have hurt the other films people dont know what they really want anymore look the movie is what it should be monsters i like it much more than gvk and for me it is one of the most fun and epic movies ever i will continue to enjoy it because i will watch it over and over again
"couldnt wait for it to end this is the first one from this run of monstersverse movies that i know i wont rewatch i dont know what tipped the balance either this timeive enjoyed them all so far even considered gvsk as the most enjoyable which considering the big change in tone surprises mesaying this movie is too ridiculous when considering the subject matter and the previous films is stupid i realise but i really think that may be why i had little interest this timegodzilla has top billing of the two but the least screen time whyso much happens just because it has to happen to forward the plot convenient plot points are plentifulthe human characters while not as pointless are still ridiculous a blooming titan vet for goodness sake wtfat least the majority of humans dont actually speak and actually play second fiddle for the majority of the film
it really bugs me at how they keep continuing to increase the humanisation of kong more and more with each filmantagonist introduced far too late and really lame in comparison to previous instalments just generally poor all round"
bad script very bad bad directing very bad a good director would make a decent movie out of this mess of a script with some creative adaptationhumans very bad acting mainly because of the directions the were given or not given at all it reminds me of nickelodeon acting ok that was harsh i apologizespecial fx were ok but with too many faults for example in the rain forest the background and only the background is filmed in fish eye lens so all of the trees are curved to the centerthe non white guy is in the film only to serve as a comic they wish relief bad dialogs bad jokes no even jokes just stupidifing the personthe amour relief is also a comic relief that plays random s music go figure
 an epic alliance gone are the days of godzilla and kong as rivals gxk hints at a legendary teamup imagine the raw power of godzillas atomic breath combined with kongs agility and strategic mind this alliance promises a fight unlike anything weve seen forcing them to confront a threat far greater than either could handle alone unveiling new titans the monsterverse has teased glimpses of other colossal creatures gxk is rumored to finally bring them to the forefront witnessing these new titans their designs and their powers interacting with the established ones will be a spectacle that will leave audiences in awe a deeper dive into hollow earth previous films hinted at a mysterious subterranean world gxk promises to delve deeper imagine a breathtaking world teeming with life both monstrous and beautiful this expansion of the monsterverse mythology will be a gamechanger offering a whole new dimension to explore humanitys role evolved monsterverse films havent shied away from humanitys struggle against titans gxk supposedly elevates humanitys role we might see advancements in antititan weaponry or alliances with ancient civilizations who possess knowledge of these creatures this shift will make the human contribution to the story more impactful the directors vision the director behind gxk is known for his bold storytelling and stunning visuals his past works hint at a film that will be both thrilling and thoughtprovoking expect him to push the boundaries of the genre delivering a truly unforgettable cinematic experiencebonus the i was there moment imagine telling your friends i saw this epic new titan battle on the big screen before anyone else being an early adopter of this potentially historic film will give you bragging rights for years to comegxk isnt just a sequel its a potential turning point for the monsterverse with its promise of epic battles groundbreaking visuals and an expanded universe its a mustwatch for any kaiju fan dont miss your chance to be part of this cinematic event
i have never understood how godzilla with such a small brain could have such a wonderful impact on the world of cinema king kong on the other hand is a warm blooded thinking individual who is possessed by procreation with human women king kong has been wronged and he needs to set the record straight while godzilla is just an inane reptile with no motivational force driving himherit put the two together and you have humans who make films about two species battling whatever it is they want to battle and hoping that humans will pay money to be bored for two hours it is a sad state of affairs when godzilla has to meet a american franchisee rather than one of his own japanese franchisees unfortunately this godzilla film has a far more intelligent and motivated king kong to deal with this cocktail does not work learn science before making stupid assumptions
godzilla x kong hearkens back to a time when movies didnt have to take themselves too seriously or preach some messagethe humans are good and they do a good job moving the story along but the monsters are the real stars of this show kong and godzilla have very distinct personalities and goals and its awesome seeing their stories evolveit feels kind of like watching the old mcuback to the human castthe main characters are actually charismatic and i found myself hoping that they wouldnt get eaten which definitely means i liked them the comic relief character bernie came off as a little bit annoying but i still liked him and jia was freaking awesomefun from start to finish i would love for this franchise to keep going for decades to come
im really worried for humanity that anyone would give this  as some people here have im really worried for humanity that anyone would give this pile of dung  or above ive never been moved to post a review on here and here i am this is complete and utter garbage please please avoidi dont really know what else to say but i cant post a review unless there are a certain amount of characters in the reviews thats pretty stupid as well so here i am trying to get to the required amount of characters because i want people to know that this movie is absolutely filth and not in a good way in a very very bad way it is complete and utter filth
i thought it was aggressively mediocre but the atrocious score by junkie xl made it even worse you could have completely removed godzilla and the entire plot would stay the same in fact i would bet on the script being salvaged from a shelved kong sequelthe visuals for kong look great but godzilla looks pretty rough especially compared to the previous entries and minus one the lighting is especially off mainly in the rome and rio scenes mothra feels like an afterthought her entire character contradicts kotm her knockoff theme sounds like its ai generatedas for the villains they both have very good designs though thats about it
i was left underwhelmed by the first godzilla versus kong moviethis one is what i was expecting the first to be was this movie better than the godfather empire strikes back or jaws nohowever this movie picks the style it should be and works on it and it pays off there is light humour silly humour and it generally pays offthe story was a device to get to an end but hey it works do yourself a favour and savour this moviethe effects were more believable than the first one and the action is aplentyi loved kong skull island this ones humour is not as broad but hey its therethis film has more elements and heart than the first one if you like a good kong movie then do not hesitate seeing this on a huge screen
i live in yuck valdosta georgia where it was raining all day and had been on tornado watch i had been inside the house all day for the past several days i needed to escape home for a while i went out to get me some essential mryyh oil and across the street from the shop i went to purchase the mryyh i remembered this new movie was out so i went over to theater and watched the   pm showing i like godzilla and kong movies for the past  years this one is entertaining it had me laughing and there were surprise moves where i jumped the special effects were good the storyline was to me boring
well they finally did it the makers of the current godzilla series perfected the formula its tight streamlined and super duper fun is it full of plotholes and incongruities oh yeah does that matter not reallyits a super fun time thats actually worth seeing on a big giant screen instead of a tv the human parts are succinct and well acted dan stevens and brian tyree henry make a surprisingly awesome comic relief tag team i was kinda shocked to find i actually wanted more of them usually the humans are the last thing you want to see in these movies the visual effects look great and the battles are nothing but good time they manage to tell a surprisingly thorough story with nothing but monster facial expressions and roaringkongs whole power glove sequence had me laughing with how silly and deusexmachina it was but again its not like it detracted from my opinion of the movie now kong has a cool robot glove to punch the other giant gorilla why would you complain about thatthis movie is just shy of two hours of pure escapism would highly recommend
a whole load of nothinggodzilla × kong the new empire is not a good movie in my opinion anyway it is similar to its predecessor in that sense at least this is a minute improvement on that  entry mind its basically a kong film though godzilla goes missing for large periods there is less human to be found onscreen which is good to see but whats added in its place with kong is just so dull to methe needless humanising of kong continues though this time its actually done in and around the other monsters because well actually im not sure why monsters are acting humanlike to each other but eh the movie i guess that suko young ape character is particularly annoying too it sounded like a clown horn and looks more belonging to that one coldplay music videothe whole film feels like if avatar and the planet of the apes reboots had a baby and thats not a positive it felt watching that it was also taking bits and pieces from other films too mind perhaps thats just me reaching the best scene of it all features the two titular characters in giza their bits together in hollow earth are decent too but their opponents are incredibly lamecastwise its ok rebecca hall and kaylee hottle are as fine as previously brian tyree henry is marginally improved and dan stevens is serviceable none of the others are all that noteworthy to me but that actually is a true plus for this production last time out i wanted less humans and less humans is what we get heremy review kinda reads as if i hate this  release i do not there are far worse pictures out there of course its just a heap of disappointment i guess i just want pure turnoffyourbrain titan carnage from these flicks which evidently is not what the monsterverse is necessarily trying to do thats probably on mecatching up on this franchise has made me want to even more check out the proper godzilla releases out of japan so there is that as for these american ones i like kong skull island at least
this movie had the potential to be remarkable but was let down by what felt like halfhearted story development my son and i found joy in it despite its flaws including numerous plot inconsistencies and a disappointing conclusion leaving the cinema i couldnt shake off a sense of dissatisfaction the trailers had set my expectations much higher and it seemed as if the narrative barely scratched the surface of its possibilities the films saving grace lay in its stellar animations and special effects along with the impressively designed monsters though the performances and storyline did not measure up while i refrain from revealing specifics certain segments felt illogical a sentiment likely shared by others whove seen it nonetheless i encourage you to see the moviesupporting theaters is important and one can only hope future films focus more on crafting compelling narratives rather than solely conveying a particular message
ive not seen visuals so good since the movie avatar they have worked on every details just by looking at this movie your testosterone level will increase to level  the adrenaline will be multiplied by  times and you will feel that you are one of those monsters fighting in real time thats how good this movie really is a proper story well executed im a fan of king kong and he shall forever remain my king a guy will good heart and big brain unlike gojira who is always showing his teeth and screaming for no reasons i dont know what is problem with gojira he always wants to fight kong if gojira didnt had that nuclear superpower my king kong would have smashed him thats cheating when you cant fight standalone to use the nuclear power this is a movie that you can watch hundred times and will never get satisfied watching it because of the visuals and actions also there are some nostalgic scenes in the movie you will love it i rate it  out of  been a fan of king kong since jack black film and will always remain a king kong fan all hail king kong glory to hanuman
overall  mostly enjoyable however you can tell that the monsterverse is aiming for a younger audience with this one which stinks because i felt the previous movies and tv show were for the adult audience to enjoy the cgi and action sequences for the most part was good there were some decent moments in the storyline but it felt like an after thoughtthey should have called it the new adventures in hollow earth disappointed with the amount of storyline devoted to godzilla not sure why he got equal billing since the bulk of the story was about kong had a bit of planet of the apes touch to iti did love godzilla napping in the coliseum though
i get it youre thinking man im kinda getting tired of seeing all these konggodzilla monster movieswe sure are jadedare you not entertaineddo yourself a solid and get yourself to your closest most favorite cinema as soon as possiblepay your admission get your ticket sit down and get ready to be blown awaythis is nonstop actionand its funny laugh out loud funnygood music too loverboy golden earring kiss etcoh yeah and theres gigantic beasts beating each other into a pulptheres that tooand it is aaaawwwwesomethe humans are great in this as wellrebecca hall dan stevens bryan tyree henryall excellentif youre thinking what else could they possible do with kong or godzillago see thisbecause they do alot with those twoand othersa whole lotbest action movie this yearit wont even be close
the original godzilla was my intro to monster movies and this is the basis of my rating i understood that they were all improbable fantasy but i learned to expect drama and excitement not schlocky cuteness instead of drama and suspense what i saw at the theater yesterday was cuteness unrealistic action and wannabe bumper music in too many scenes it felt like i was watching one of the entries in guardians of the galaxy not the king of the monsters and fay wrays enigmatic companionafter we got home i caught a b movie on cable eye of the beast and realized that despite the low budget it was far better than godzilla x kong was the monster effects were low budget the actors not alist and the dialog sometimes fell flat but it was still an okay movie it did what it was intended to do scare and entertain me for a whilesave your money and stay home if the next entry is as bad as this im giving up in toho altogether
the makers of godzilla x kong the new empire should be sued for false advertising the two titular titans dont encounter each other until the home stretch of the moviebefore that theres endless and unnecessary exposition g x k suffers from having too much plot and it takes way too long to bring the iconic monsters togetherthe film is a continuation of s godzilla vs kong and has a few of the same cast members including rebecca hall as a kongologistkong has been banished to middle earth to prevent another catastrophic battle with godzilla oddly no one seems overly concerned that a giant reptile with radioactive breath is roaming around freely in fact zilla has gotten comfy taking naps in the coliseum in romekong is having a much more stressful time in middle earth encountering a race of similar giant apes ruled by the violent scar king and in a bizarroworld twist scar king has a giant lizard pal who can freeze things with his breath  basically a bad version of godzillaits up to the human cast members to save kong by steering godzilla his way so that they can form a kaiju tag teamyeah none of this makes sense g x k could have made for a good popcorn movie if it had a much tighter plot and brought the two title monsters together much earlier as it is g x k is way too long and at times very tough to sit throughthe cgi effects especially of kong are impressive but the film as a whole is less fun than a barrel of monkeys
this movie is easily on par with the movie that came before it the kongs and zillas in it are well done and the story line is good i like how the world kind of humors godzilla to stop the monsters it encounters even as it results in the destruction of their oldest cities the villain is pretty dynamic in relation to how kong looks with his own look and abilities the plot i must reiterate is very good i do have issue with a few things notably the human cast is still awful and annoying and it could have trimmed  minutes off overall the movie is pretty excellent and easy to recommend and as a godzilla fan i liked the interpretation of anguirus 
how this movie missed the mark need to go back to the one before this kong found middle earth and while there he found the ape castle as many asked and was stated in that movie all kong sized apes were deceased so how do we get all these new apessecond was the action of the cgi at times it is way too fast so whatever you think you saw you would really need to watch closelythird was the music way too much as it over powered the acting of the voices of the charactersfinally was the over acting of characters all this we can blame on the director it is himher who says how each scene should be whether it is cgi or real charactersto me i wish they would of stay to the kong godzilla story line and not that of adding unrealistic moments that just do not make senseso the writers fail keeping the story line the director fails for all the issues producers fail to realize they have made big mistakes throughout the moviei was being generous by giving it a  out of  maybe next one will be better another miss in big movies of 
an action packed film where  former rivals must work together for the greater good godzilla x kong the new empire follows both kong and godzilla on their own adventures where they run into various adversaries until they must work together and stop a common enemyi found the cgi in some hollow earth scenes to be shaky in the grand scheme of things it held up the fight scenes with these huge titans continue to captivate audiencesanother great thing about this film was brian tyree henrys character bernie whenever there was a down period he always made a joke to add some much needed humour to this action adventurein conclusion i had a great time watching this movie and think it should be viewed in theatres a lot of great action scenes and fun for the whole family
i went to see godzilla and as usual his presence in the whole movie was only  minutes max the film seemed biased towards kong focusing more on his character and actions all the fighting scenes were cut short which was disappointing im glad i didnt opt for the expensive imax tickets otherwise i would have regretted it later anyway i just hope the franchise wont follow the marvel path where all the movies are made for kids nowadaysthe visual effects were amazing although it felt like this time it was a bit of a downgrade compared to the previous god x kong movie i hope the next movie will shed some life on godzillas life as well
what they need to get away from are humans i just came from the big screen theater and i still dont know who the target audience is for this movie lovers of kong godzilla kids adults anime i am old school kong  godzilla mothra and all the rest they didnt like or care for humans or civilization today they come on like they are half human  half animal maybe i am getting old lol i found some of the characters very annoying and most distracting loud explosions all out fights monsters now have weapons of mass destruction  their emotions for an animal strained belief it reminds me of pet owners who try to humanize their pets dress them up talk silly to them and feed them with loving mother care your loving pet boa will eat your kid if you dont watch out kong can sign language better than humans too that means he is close to being able to read this movie had too much happening to take in unless explained and even after that it is just too many things at once kids cannot follow the movie theme and as an adult if they didnt explain it i was lost a good director makes us sit back and presents a movie to entertain here we have to work at the story to appreciate it also the script writers have to stop using god or oh my god in these movies god is the supreme creator and is greater than the movie world mentioning him ruins the movie fantasy kong  godzilla will always have a place at the dinner table at my house however lets all keep our true identities while eat stop with the farfetched hard to grasp  straining of the beliefs here
it seems like lessons learned from  godzilla vs kong this one has much more action time more exploration of hollow earth and way more monster fights just the right amount of human involvement for pacing exposition humor and relatability the comedic elements land better than in the last installment and the movie doesnt take itself too seriously the soundtrack and music direction were very good some of the previous characters are not present but it doesnt matter jia has an important role and the actress playing her is very expressive without speaking the special effects are all convincing and well done
movie is horrible the  stars are for the cgi work donehollywood lost its way and cannot have decent script or story there is no thought in few scenarios of the movieyou are running monarc and for the mission you carry a tourist a friend and kid with one security personal who you can bet from the first instance that he is going to dieyou have folks living on level ii of the hollow earth working on gravity and adding metal paint to make it work what a pathetic wayfinally its a no brainer kids might enjoy to see at the kong and godzilla but these scenarios are also limited except for the last  minutesi would not recommend this movie to anyone
gxk isnt just a sequel its a potential turning point for the monsterverse with its promise of epic battles groundbreaking visuals and an expanded universe its a mustwatch for any kaiju fan dont miss your chance to be part of this cinematic eventforget everything you thought you knew about monster brawls gxk is shaping up to be the ultimate evolution of the monsterverse heres why an epic alliance gone are the days of godzilla and kong as rivals gxk hints at a legendary teamup imagine the raw power of godzillas atomic breath combined with kongs agility and strategic mind this alliance promises a fight unlike anything weve seen forcing them to confront a threat far greater than either could handle alone unveiling new titans the monsterverse has teased glimpses of other colossal creatures gxk is rumored to finally bring them to the forefront witnessing these new titans their designs and their powers interacting with the established ones will be a spectacle that will leave audiences in awe a deeper dive into hollow earth previous films hinted at a mysterious subterranean world gxk promises to delve deeper imagine a breathtaking world teeming with life both monstrous and beautiful this expansion of the monsterverse mythology will be a gamechanger offering a whole new dimension to explore humanitys role evolved monsterverse films havent shied away from humanitys struggle against titans gxk supposedly elevates humanitys role we might see advancements in antititan weaponry or alliances with ancient civilizations who possess knowledge of these creatures this shift will make the human contribution to the story more impactful the directors vision the director behind gxk is known for his bold storytelling and stunning visuals his past works hint at a film that will be both thrilling and thoughtprovoking expect him to push the boundaries of the genre delivering a truly unforgettable cinematic experienceso must watch it best movie i ever had after goji 
this movie suffers from several issues that hinder its potential the relentless background music and sound effects particularly the constant monkey calls are overwhelming and distracting additionally the focus seems locked in the center of the screen leaving everything else blurry this lack of clear visuals detracts from the experiencethe acting unfortunately falls short even making the cgi characters appear more believable in comparisonfurthermore the film struggles to reconcile the largescale destruction caused by the monsters with the seemingly normal lives of the people in the cities they attack a postapocalyptic setting could have addressed this dissonance and created a more believable atmosphereoverall the movie falls flat while the ambition to follow in the footsteps of classic monster films like the original king kong is admirable the execution falls short
as one person said before me i would say that lp and wb wanted to eat a hamburger with too much aditive i would say also lack of dialogue lack of tension fast forwarding and too much roaring and screaming godzilla minus one would kick its ass the company should learn from toho i hope they will use the very same money from movie to invest into knowledge because this is hilarious every year old would consider this a movie failure and i am not sure how can people on imdb rate it as  i mean it is an insult for an excellent movie so all in all i would not recommend the movie unless people are eager to see some unseen and unreal godzilla acrobatics 🤣
i recently watched godzilla vs kong a new empire and wanted to share my thoughts overall its a visually stunning and actionpacked film the cgi effects are impressive and the battles between godzilla and kong are epic the storyline is engaging with moments of emotional depth though some plot points felt rushed despite this the movie is a thrilling addition to the monsterverse franchise and is highly recommended for fans of the genrei love the monsterverse and the other godzilla and kong movies and this film was a perfect addition to the seriesi will watch it again when it realeses on netfilx or hbo
alright dude so godzilla × kong the new empire wasnt that great its basically a kong movie with godzilla barely showing up they try to make kong and the other monsters act all humanlike which is kinda weird theres this annoying little ape character suko who sounds like a clown horn and looks like something out of a coldplay videothe whole movie feels like a mix of avatar and the new planet of the apes movies but not in a good way it seems like they borrowed ideas from other films too the best part is the scene in giza with godzilla and kong and the stuff in hollow earth is okay but the monsters they fight are super lamethe acting is fine but nobody really stands out except maybe rebecca hall kaylee hottle brian tyree henry and dan stevens there arent as many humans in this one which is a good thingoverall this movie is a huge disappointment i just want to see giant monsters smashing stuff but this movie isnt really about that i guess ill have to stick with the japanese godzilla movies this whole franchise just makes me want to watch those even more at least kong skull island was decent
easily the best entry in the monsterverse so far the critics reviews are ridiculous its not exactly oscar worthy but its everything you want from a monster flick if youre a fan of the previous films youll love this one yes its goofy and dumb at times however its entertaining from start to finishthe pacing is excellent engaging throughout without any lulls it does move fast at times but at least its not slow human characters and dialogue is much better too read how bad the exposition dumps are but i didnt have an issue with itthe soundtrack and synth score was very s and worked really well the colours and visuals were great didnt have an issue with the cgi at all the action and fights were greatset up for future instalments well cant wait to see what comes next highly recommended seeing it in the cinema
"soooooo technically well done and thats where it stops
its been a long time since ive seen a movie this shallow at times i just wanted to skip some of the action scenes which there are plenty of there is no pacing in this movie its just action action action story tries to do something then something superficial comes along and action action action i actually wouldnt care if the bad guys won even though i actually dont really know who the bad guys are this movie is the epiphany of not giving a crp about plot the characters or anything in between its cgi all the way baby"
really who go through this and change things that should not i was excited to see it due to the action scenes but then things started to get cartoonishly weak  dentist at the scene to change a bad tooth etc even the slavery scene of the other kongs and their leader cmon what is thatthe human aspect was too low and time element as we know in movies doesnt exist but even though this is too much in such a movie but really why change a good franchise and turn it into something you only see in cartoonsplease give a good godzilla and king kong movie where each fight monsters real monsters
"godzilla x kong the new empire
dynamic and bigger characters with a well rounded story makes this a spring bonanzakong starts with a bang and then godzilla shows its prowess enhanced powers for both of them is a feast to the eyesantagonist scar king is pure menace little king steals the heart with emotions and awwnessits indeed one of the best visual spectacle in the kong godzilla genre and you will have plenty of oh my god and wow factors with great build up and hair rising finaleits a gigantic bombastic and super charged moviewatch it only on imax d and enjoy this mesmerizing eye feast"
star rating  brilliant  very good  okay  poor  awfulin a futuristic world the two big screen titans godzilla and king kong exist separately on earth with godzilla roaming around with the humans while kong exists among his fellow primates on hollow earth as long as they remain in their territories everything should be fine says scientist iilene andrews rebecca hall so needless to say things dont and her adopted daughter jila kaylee hotton starts sketching disturbing images leading to a journey to me and a confrontation with kongs nemesis the scar kingweve had alien vs predator batman vs superman and now director adam wingard has delivered a show down between two of cinemas most notable gigantic beasts well there could have been a worse excuse to have them smash everything up the irony that may be lost on the filmmakers is that there isnt actually much in any way of an actual showdown at all but enough stamping around and battling with other creatures to distract everyone from this but not quite enough to gloss over all the flawsif nothing else the film is an alluring visual spectacle reminiscent of peter jacksons  reimagining of the original s film the magic of which i can still remember the central cast fit their roles suitably enough with young actress hottle particularly worthy as the troubled girl at the centre of all the hoohah with a decent enough supporting cast including dan stevens as a trippy hippy ace ventura mercenary and brian tyree henry in the expert who wasnt listened to cliched role but none of the performances are anything to match any of the effects or action sequencestheres a lot of roaring and swinging and smashing the sort of which would look great with a pair of d specs but it wouldnt be wise to expect any more than that 
gxk beats all the monsterverse moviesthank you adam for gifting us a phenomenal one as a godzilla plus monsterverse fan i can proudly say we won and for the people who are comparing it to minus one i guess you guys dont have the brain what to compare me and my friends loved watching godzilla and kong together and we were on our feet all the timei am not going to spoil but you need to see this movie on big screen totally worth it and if you are not a regular monsterverse fan i would suggest you to watch all the monsterverse movies till date before watching gxkit was a hell of ride hope we can get a next monsterverse movie soon
the whole hollow earth thing is lame i cant stand the plot line i guess everyone else likes it but its so unnecessary and wait for itcorny isnt the appeal and attraction of  foot titans fighting awesome enough do we need a plot device to unnecessarily explain more monsters i dont the radiation is enough of a background story for mei liked it loved the action the vfx and wellthe monsters but everything else about this i hated which is strange because the plot and storyline for skull island first godzilla and godzilla king of the monsters was pretty awesome the mystery suspense conspiracy theory and downright epicness of those films were phenomenal but kong new empire they dropped the ball next movie should be set in space at this point
godzilla x kong the new empire  dives back into the monsterverse with high ambitions promising to explore the mysterious origins of hollow earth and the ancient battles that linked humans and titans this time around the spotlight shines on the enigmatic skull island and its secrets as godzilla and kong join forces to confront a massive undisclosed threat that endangers their existence as well as humanitys the premise is exciting and ripe with potential yet the execution feels somewhat lacking as if the storyline is just a vehicle for the spectacular showdownshowever the film struggles to find its own identity within the monsterverse often feeling like a rehash of previous entries with an overdependence on cgi while the visual effects are impressive they overshadow a script that misses the mark on innovation and depth the result is a movie that although fun and filled with typical kaiju chaos ultimately serves up little beyond surfacelevel entertainment going in with low expectations i still found myself disappointed the new empire could have been a fresh chapter for the franchise but instead settles into familiar grooves leaving it feeling more like a missed chance to truly evolve the series
so i went to the cinema with  of my friends and the movie was incredible skar king was very strong and the fight between kong and skar king was insane godzilla also went around trying to get energi and charging up for an attack which made ud very hyped up the villain scar king was also first introduced halfway through the movie so we had no idea what to expect from the villain while godzilla was going aroung collecting energy which showed that the fight scene was going to be legendary and it really was then there was a whole army which made signals to godzilla and thats why it went aroung collecting energy its just so fun to watch and i recommend anyone to watch this movie
ok first of all it has some entertaining moments  it is better than kaylee hottle interaction was better than millie bobby brown but at the end that was mediocre  but my biggest issues with this movie isnt actors or some plot holes my biggest issue is the last scene where skar king fighting with kong and godzilla  they literally destroyed the brazil killed thousands and wrecked building and houses  so what was the point of that fight  to not destory humans  they almost did it with that fight  the directing has problems cause they could brought that fight on hollow earth where the destructions was less and more believable you want to see more believable godzilla  watch minus one 
it is really worth to d as it was especially made for d like avatar the story is also simple and clear in monsterverse it is a necessary movie and many goosebumps scenes are presented sounds also so good you can see many of godzilla new characteristics and actions as well as kong human scenes and monster scenes are handled perfectly in fact monsters are given more importance than humans as there is no scenes which seems to be boring and there is no scenes to be taken to extend the length of movie many surprise scenes actions are there if you see without any pre known spoilers watch it on d theatre
"it just didnt stop the funny oneliners the predicted story the monster desktop backgrounds the predictable twists a shiny rock a and b need to connect to save to earth 
there was too much story just going forward and nobody made a choiceit felt like the power rangers making a teamhumans are running around but only the year old is relevant as a plot devicei want to be scared of big monsters but this is lincoln konggreat visual but this is no longer a big ape story or an annoyed lizardthis is teen titan drama i miss the real cause and influence and serious results"
i was quite excited when i saw that there would be a new godzilla series in  but unfortunately its not very good in my opinionlets skip the visuals effects soundtrack and others because i think this is good enoughthe weakness of this series is in the storyline now it focuses more on the underworld and the world above different from the previous series the existence of monsters like godzilla is very natural and no longer surprising to mankind and this disappointed me a little because godzillas existence should be a threat but now he isntthe next drawback is that the battles between monsters are that this series shows more monsters than human interaction itself more sounds argh uuwaa arhgh hm ughr and what is that basically the roaring sound monstersi think this is quite disturbing to the ears because their roaring schedule is more extensive herethe point is that this series focuses more on monsters and their roars than humans even though i think its better than godzilla and other monsters being a mystery and threat to humans there is no friendship between the two
godzilla x kong is fun packed movie which wont let you get off your seat the movies picturization and cgi are top notch kongs character development and the bond between jiya and ilene has also developed which is a good thing jiya was given a great responsibility in the movie which gives her a good development as a character who was thought to be useless by many including me however some other characters in the movie such as godzilla mothra and shimo were underutilized godzilla is literally the king of the monsters and the movie treated him like a side character adam wingard focuses only on kong and characters related to him perhaps he should focus a little bit more on godzilla as he plays an integral role in the monsterverse i would have appreciated the movie more if all these points were followed and if the monster lore was explored even morei give this movie a score of 
only a few months before godzilla minus one gained praise and accolades this fifth film in the monsterverse franchise perhaps got less favourable reviews i knew exactly what i was in for but i was prepared to see it on the big screen directed by adam wingard youre next the guest blair witch godzilla vs kong basically three years after mechagodzilla was defeated kong has settled into his new environment in the hollow earth but longs for more of his kind on earths surface godzilla continues to fight against titans other giant monsters who threaten humanity after killing scylla in rome italy he rests in the colosseum an unidentified signal is picked up by a monarch observation outpost stationed in the hollow earth on the surface the signal causes jia kaylee hottle the last known survivor of the iwi tribe from skull island to experience hallucinations and visions her adoptive mother dr ilene andrews rebecca hall who communicates with her by sign language is concerned because she feels she does not belong on earth godzilla also senses the signal leaves rome and attacks a nuclear plant in france to absorb the radiation godzilla then heads to the lair of the titan tiamat in the arctic monarch believes godzilla is strengthening himself for an oncoming threat a sinkhole opens near kongs home he discovers a tribe of his species has survived in an uncharted region he encounters a juvenile named suko they have an initial confrontation but they bond after suko leads kong to the tribes lair the tribes tyrannical leader the skar king battles kong with help from the ancient icepowered titan shimo controlled by the skar king with pain using a crystal kongs right arm is injured by frostbite from shimos ice breath but he escapes with help from suko although he loses his axe in the process led by mercenary mikael alex ferns andrews and jia alongside titan veterinarian trapper dan stevens and conspiracy podcaster bernie hayes brian tyree henry travel to the hollow earth to locate the source of the signal they find the monarch outpost destroyed after mikael is killed by a carnivorous tree the group ventures forward and discovers a temple that leads them to a subterranean section the group discovers a surviving iwi tribe who communicate telepathically with each other inspecting some ruins they deduce that the signal was a telepathic distress call sent by the tribe while observing jia socialising with the iwi andrews tells trapper her fear that jia may choose to stay with her people and leave her andrews uncovers hieroglyphics inside a temple displaying the past and future the skar king previously attempted to conquer the surface world and waged war against godzillas species but godzilla defeated him and trapped him and his tribe deep within the hollow earth a prophecy indicates that jia is the key to reawakening mothra a colossal sentient flighted insect kong is found to be injured after he locates the temple when he is sedated trapper equips a prototype exoskeletal arm brace to strengthen and heal his damaged arm unbeknownst to them one of the skar kings loyalists has followed them and informs the skar king of what is going on and he assembles an army to invade earth jia successfully wakes up the reborn mothra godzilla kills tiamat and absorbs cosmic radiation from her lair evolving him and turning his dorsal plates magenta kong surfaces in cairo and calls out to godzilla hoping to lure him to the hollow earth to assist him godzilla is angered and attacks him despite kong attempting to communicate with him they have a brief fight before mothra arrives with jia and convinces godzilla to help kong godzilla kong and mothra then head back to hollow earth to face the skar king shimo and the army the fight takes godzilla kong shimo and the skar king to rio de janeiro brazil the skar king forces shimo to breathe his cold breath and induce another ice age both sides are evenly matched until suko arrives with kongs axe and the crystal controlling shimo is destroyed shimo and kong then freeze and shatter the skar king godzilla uses his atomic breath to thaw shimos ice age and he returns to rest in the colosseum jia reunites with andrews and assures her that she is choosing to stay with her adoptive mother mothra restores the barrier protecting the iwis home and then leaves shimo and suko return to hollow earth and kong becomes the new leader of the ape tribe also starring fala chen as the iwi queen rachel house as hampton kevin copeland as submarine commander and anthony brandon wong as talk show anchor hall stevens and henry give reasonable performances but it is the giant gorilla and the kingsized reptilian that are the stars as they both clash with each other and then work together along with recognisable movie creature mothra it is nothing we havent seen before two giant creatures destroying large cities across the world and roaming about in landscapes in parallel universes but the special effects are well done and you can just sit back and enjoy the carnage a silly but not boring sciencefiction monster action worth watching
this is a literal cinematic masterpiece and my perspective on life has changed after i watched this movie ill never be able to watch a movie again because i know nothing can compare to this movie it is so good i cant even comprehend it and the directors were definitely putting some work behind the monster emotions i had went to go see this having low expectations but this movie banged the humans in the background were hyping up the big fight and the monsters have this cool vibe very lit where the monsters come together and have this big fight something i live for one thing i didnt like about godzilla and kong is that they tried to force this convoluted plot to make them team up and it kind of gets ridiculous and didnt feel natural another thing i do not like is that they tried to make the humans important characters like i do not want to watch godzilla and kong for the humans i want to watch it for the big cgi monsters fighting
i am sorry but being a fan of kong brought me to tears at the way this hodge podge of inane scriptwriting and acting were put out there for us to enjoythe actors all played dim witted versions of their abilities i hope thats what it was and not their best on showi know its supposed to be fantasy but with all the brilliant cgi it was completely wasted with the ridiculous story i think there was a story maybe just sometimes and the less than memorable actingone scene sticks as to how utterly inept they were by showing a chopper carrying a small bit of tech somehow miraculously able to cover kongs hand to elbow when you needed  fullsize people to cover just one of his finger nailsi am truly sorry to say do not waste your time and although i am yet to try watching it muted i doubt even this might make it its saving grace
finally the monsterverse takes itself seriously an amazing movie with a great conclusion the simian titan society reminds me a lot of planet of the apes skar king was an awesome yet intimidating villain they really knocked it out of the park with his design i wish they had gone into more depth about shimos backstory but maybe they will in the next movie suko was a great addition and the bond between him and kong is really wholesomethe next part contains spoilersthe climax was a little unrealistic with godzilla and shimo both shooting radiation and ice into the sky respectively trying to save the world they accidentally created a nuclear winter and another ice age 😆😆😆 i found it funny how at the end godzilla went back to sleep in the coliseum that was funny my theory is that since kong is now the ruler of the apes theyre finally going to call him king kong which would be awesome
if you love monsters this is movie for you kong is very expressive and displays a lot emotions without words making move less dependent on humans its a movie of kong with godzilla in an op guest appearance need to work more on story for mindless action and fun its best you will enjoy the movie slow burn in start and picks up pace too quick in half time little bit balance in pace would have been better the end felt little rushed but it was visually stunning personally didnt like the shiny design of the secondary villan scar king is awesome needed to be explored more he was an interesting character
a  out of  i love the dynamic that godzilla and kong have it looks amazing pretty good storyline and the humans are actually funny i havent been this entertained in the movie theaters in a while i love how the villain has so much personality pretty good pacing really funny action scenes definitely worth the wait if you were a godzilla fan this movie is easley a  out  cant wait for what nextand finally titans cgi is really good fight scenes dont disappoint and the most important thing monsters act like they should act theres startegy theres a lot of preparing but also theres hierarchy decisions made out of fear and fights for territory writers managed to make the titans seem humane while also staying within their animal naturethe outcome of that is convincing at least for metheres a lot of worldbuilding here successfull one in my opinionancient civilization prophecies stories written on walls some scores to even the hollow earth looks great you can see how this whole ecosystems works with its own rules
"well on my second watch simultaneously i was clearly satisfied with the pacing action human interaction and story i was overjoyed that my doubts were just mere doubts monsterverse new entry has stretched the screen time of monsters to satisfaction to the point where kongs expressions are more convincing than most of the actors period and i gotta say that dan stevens is so very charming and he fits in the monsterverse paradigm very easily everything in this movie makes complete sense even the pyramids dont listen to any fools review downgrading this movie just give it a tryon the other hand lets talk about monsterverse
yes it will continue and each entry will try to be unique and fresh hell for all i know well see the next monsters flick in  years from now and that is my confidence and optimism put together in the monsterverse sagafor all i know  years from now there will be new wave of directors and in those there will be a director that will be wholly inspired by the godzilla monsterverse will withstand the test of time and will prosper and evenly continue its legacy"
this movie isnt trying to win awards but it delivers exactly what it promises a monster brawl for the ages forget complex characters this is all about giant lizards and giant apes going at it its a cgi extravaganza and the way they show these creatures communicate without words is awesomewhile godzilla x kong might be in the title this is kongs show kong plus one would have been the apt title if you want less human drama although appropriate amount especially for the jokes that land and more monster mayhem this is the godzilla and kong movie for you its a popcorn flick through and through but a thoroughly entertaining one just be prepared for humans to get squashed like ants  these titans play for keeps
wow im just as surprised as you are reading this right now believe me my expectations were kind of meh me personally godzilla vs kong gvk was okay nothing special maybe about a so who won this time in godzilla x kong  what is this new empire well legendary studios of courseafter a victorious achievement for toho we all know what weve come for here at legendary studios  the results are definitely not a minus onebecause this time we up the ante and the people have spoken we want this legendary in this film is simply unlocking the massive cheese vault oozing into my optic stems godzilla x kong the new empire is a hyper adrenaline rush energizer it felt like my brain waves digested a high voltage energy drink kicking every inch of my brain cellsdan stevens is a solid comic relief along with brian tyree henry the jokes land a bit better this time around the aura  creative decisions in this film have almost an s vintage vibrant feel the music  color palette compliment each other perfectly along with cinematographymy issues well why does the movie have monarch being okay with bringing anybody down to hollow earth reliance on slight jumpy exposition small things that could have been explored a little more to leave more an impact its not perfect for those however i will argue this film was a lot closer to striking close to being perfect than you would think a film of this caliber could dothis is what happens when cinematography awareness consistency  finding the footing on following kaijus gets the best of a cinematic experience its just as much a kaiju story as it is a human story  its a love letter to the showa era  fans should be proudive never been more invested in the actual story of the kaijus until this movie expositions  humans dont ruin it either this time its not anything special but what is special are what we are here for  thats the kaijusnew empire by far has the longest showtime for kaiju action that ive ever seen in a monster flick beautifully shot cinematic camera scenes there is one specific upside down shot unfolding to the right side up just amazing cameraworkthe gradual building blocks embedded in the story left exciting awe in entertainment  care of handling kaiju moments the humans are just enhancers for the monsters compared to gvk they have a better direction here without getting lostits a ride took the issues of gvk  corrected it more theres plenty of action if not more than youd think theres plenty of surprises emotional character moments with humansmonsters  although a not so perfect expositions still a solid fun plotstory following the elements at play godzilla x kong was a lot better than i thought it was going to be  thats worth something
i effing loved it trying to find time to go watch it again and again a few years ago the academy awards entertained the idea of introducing a category for outstanding achievement in popular film which frankly seemed quite silly however had they followed through i believe this film would have been a strong contender watching it in imax was an incredible experience the cinematography action and sound were all elevated to another level while it may not win best picture it undoubtedly offers an awesome cinematic experience the audience in my theater reacted as if it were a superhero movie with plenty of ooohs and ahhhs and even some cheers the film has a bit of a slow start with kong heavily featured but godzilla steals the show there are numerous surprises and the story is more substantial than expected my only minor gripe is that i kept anticipating characters and storylines from other installments and the monarch show to appear but theyre only vaguely referenced its a bit strange how everything is connected yet not fully explored surprisingly there are no mid or postcredit scenes leaving room for speculation about future installments hopefully there will be more because these kaiju flicks are progressively improving with each entry overall a great flick that i anticipate will exceed its budget and become profitable looking forward to what comes next
i thoroughly enjoyed this film for it was a mixture of action and scifi possibly one of the best movies to come out in these past few years there were many key parts to this movie that i shant spoil to the lot of you but every single minute of this movie was a joy the movie is an action packed film with amazing special effects throughout the plot  although plain and simplewas covered up by the great affects acting fighting destruction and comedy its a great movie for slightly older children and for adults who are fans of the two titans i genuinely thought this is the best godzilla or king kong movie ever made 
i just saw the premiere today it was simply fantastic to watch i cant wait if they make another one in the future maybe around like  to  years i was on the edge of my seat the whole timei felt like i was  years old again from when i saw godzilla  in theaters it feels so good to feel young again when youre seeing one of your favorite childhood monsters on the big screen again after so long simply marvelous entertainment great visual effects and funny dialogue and a good cast monsterverse always entertains and always delivers for its fans and audiences it feels so great to watch them on the big screen
for me its already the top  best film of the year the feeling cannot be written or described the best thing to do is go to the cinema and watch this masterpiece you felt the energy godzilla vs kong was very good but this is a whole other level cgi action scenes the titans the hollow earth environment all impeccable thats what agent likes giant monsters from the hollow earth and giant monsters getting beat up  for me its the best movie in this incredible universe i can say with all the words that this is the best monstervese movie action from start to finish monsters everywhere new titans dougs appearance was incredible in the opening scenes this is a monster movie warner made bonito in this one the fight scenes were epic even more so the final in rio de janeiro cgi was perfect they made reference to gow  it was incredible to see this with kong and suko on the adventure through the hollow earth encountering challenges along the way and defeating enemies the scene with kong beating the gorillas and using suko as a club were very good 😂😂 the upp that kong is godzilla received were very epic godzilla became more agile and faster kong received the bionic glove seriously i had never seen a bionic glove as strong and durable as this one kong with this weapon knocking out godzilla and taking him by the tail even the portal was hilarious one of the best scenes even the humans were good in this film and there were more titan scenes than human scenes it was a monster fight practically from beginning to end every scene was beautiful and many references too godzilla x kong the new empire  👏👏👏
just saw godzilla x kong the new empire and i thought it was an awesome movie it is also really awesome to experience this movie in d it made feel like you are riding on a ride of a theme parkit was neat to see another team up to legendary movie monsters of godzilla and kong against  new monsters of scar king and shimoi really the new updates of kong with a gauntlet type glove and godzilla getting new lookthrough the father and son chemistry between kong had with the little baby kong was so very cutelove the introductions of the  new monsters but if i have to pick a favorite of the  monsters i have to say the shimo has to be my favorite i just loved her design and i hope we get to see more of her in future movies
i came into this with high expectations and was not disappointed godzilla and kong movies have a pattern where they take turns as the lead if you keep that in mind you will love this moviethere are several kaiju battles and all are great the human part of this movie we important because it ties in a couple of the past movies and sets the stage for future films i also want to mention that in the japanese godzilla films godzilla was caused by nuclear bombs dropped by the americans on japan in the americans canon like this one there is an ancient history with all the kaiju you cant mix the two or you just find fault in everything as expected lip smack the two main kaiju kong and godzilla are both bigger than they were in the last movie and with the addition of mothra vamped and looking pretty amazing i was pleasantly pleased and thats not saying there aint other kaju but watch the film so you can enjoy those too
minus one sure one had great effects but i didnt care one iota for the characters and found much of the movie boring this on the other hand was spectacular and action packed from beginning to end some truly amazing non stop kaiju fights and featuring one of the most epic scenes put on screen when the  major combatants are jumping toward each other the movie unfortunately does short godzilla emphasizing a lot more on kong but his solo fights are incredible to behold the human element here is even more duller than usual though bryan and dan try to liven things up when they can but who cares most of are here for the kaiju fights and there the movie excels beyond all expectations see it on the biggest screen you can and enjoy
its like they were expecting the notebook love storydo you like rollercoasters and enjoying a movie without thinking about overcomplexity if your answer is yes this movie is for youfresh off of viewing the previous entry into the monsterverse series by legendary pictures godzilla x kong the new empire brings the superstar kaiju godzilla back for another adventure in saving the world and this time there are many new faces including the infamous scar king and shimogodzillas name comes first in the title though his involvement is belated a vast duration of the films runtime is centered around kong as he explores the hollow earth in search of his speciesthe film from start to finish is a rollercoaster with nonstop action the lighthearted and comicbooklike portrayal of characters makes the movie appeal to a broader audience without having to catch up with every entry in the series so faras a longtime godzilla fan i can say with confidence that this movie made me feel like a kid watching showaera godzilla films once again it was good fun that gives all of the kaiju combat you need on a deeper level films like godzilla minus one scratch that itch for an intense emotional story with the seriousness cranked to 
"with the follow on from godzilla vs kong were kong and godzilla must work together to fight the next big threat to humanity and the titans habitat this stunningly lower then normal budget godzillaxkongthenewempire delivers on one of the beat visually stunning movies of movie  with many twists and turns as we jump from titant to titan in almost a triple story intertwined with the previous cast of godzilla vs kong with few new faces acting was above and beyond so if your wondering should i go see godzilla x kong then yes yes your shouldbased on performance stunning flawless visual cgi effects

the ones whining about how the story is so uninspired how the characters are basic should or whatever else madeup criticism they spew out should really reconsider why they even watch movies in the first placeits called entertainment if the movie is entertaining than it has served its purpose this movie aims to give you an awesome balls to the wall way smackdown between a giant radioactive dinosaur a the biggest gorilla ever and a savage cruel and lean orangutang with a spinewhip and that it delivers along with an absolutely colossal ice drake twice the size of godzilla himselfthe action never feels worn out of repetative it takes breaks to let the viewers breath but then it gets right back to the good stuff there are several big fight scenes in the movie with the final clash of the titansthe movie is also absolutely stunning the scenery and visuals are beautiful and in my opinion almost rival that of peter jacksons king kong from  the greatest konghuge monster movie ever the scenes with minikong and big kong are also surprisingly wholesome and the  form a very nice bond throughout the film
godzilla x kong the new empire oh give me a home where the giant dire wolves roam  its in hollow earth actually and a pack of them are pursuing kong he disposes of them but he has an aching tooth so he sojourns to the surface exciting near the monarch headquarters on bermuda he has the bad tooth extracted and an implant replacement inserted meanwhile godzilla is taking on the other titans rome isnt wrecked in a day while he battles a giant crab spider some damage but could have been worse godzilla curls up the colosseum to sleep the monarch bases pick up an anomalous signal which leads to a reconnaissance mission to the hollow earth kong discovers more giant apes and after fighting with the adults acquires a cute toddler ape things take an indiana jones turn when archaeological ruins are discovered it swiftly veers into edgar rice burroughs territory the hollow earth has a lost civilisation there is a threat to the surface world but to reveal the nature of it would be a spoiler suffice to say that kong will need the assistance of godzilla and mothra if he is to have any chance of countering the menace some great cgi as titans battle the fighting apes are something new we also get undersea action and gravity used as a weapon plus carnivorous trees the humans are mainly hohum apart from kaylee hottle as jia who maintains her link with kong and puts in a creditable performance i guess the dialogue is a tad weak at times the story is well thought out though especially the lost civilisation kong is very much the star in this film with godzilla in a supporting role and mothra in a cameo directed by adam wingard written by terry rossio simon barrett and jeremy slater 
your opinion on this movie will change drastically depending on how much you can stand the humans they always cut back to personally i thought they were fine here but there are definitely going to be people who wish they were cut entirely it especially hurts in the beginning as there is a solid half hour or so of them setting up the story in between shots of the titular characters and while their scenes were certainly the weakest there are more than plenty of kaiju fights to go aroundfor those who come to this film wanting some story with their fights there is actually a really good plot thread involving kong he is the main protagonist of the film despite the title implying shared screentime and the majority of his scenes have no human interaction whatsoever instead the film beautifully tells its story through the body language of the kaiju as they interact and face off against each otherobviously people will want to see this movie for the action and the action more than delivers there are nearly a dozen different fights in this movie and the worst that can be said is that some are too short theyre all beautifully shot catch all the action and each major kaiju has a big moment at least onceas for godzilla while hes not in play nearly as much as kong he still has presence in the film and a couple of my favorite moments the most ill say without getting into spoilers is that hes like a house cat doing his own thing and not caring how it inconveniences othersi highly recommend seeing this on the big screen get a bucket of popcorn sit back and enjoy this two hour ride of fun you wont regret it
we have to highlight that due to the previous plot in the monsterverse any story they put in this movie we were going to accept as we wantedi mean lets be honest true godzilla fans only want to see explosions fights good effects and godzilla breaking everyones nervesthe only thing in this movie was that they put godzilla in the background which bothers me a lot because kong was the center of attention from the moment the movie begins until it endswe dont mind seeing kong being the alpha marcher hes always been but really only kong will be the protagonist but anyway the movie is very entertaining which is whats importantif you are looking for a science fiction movie with a deep welldeveloped plot go see dune  now if what you want is to see blows blows explosions screams more blows and senseless violence then you should see this moviein the end i just paid for the ticket to see fights and it was worth every penny i cant wait to see whats next
i cant remember the last time i got excited about watching a movie in theaters this was a fun action packed movie with a pretty decent storyline i hate they didnt bring back some other important members skarsgard brown but happy to see brian henry back shout out from the  its for sure lighter in story than godzilla  however my complaint about that godzilla is we hardly saw him i personally enjoyed the storyline it gave kong a happyish ending ive always been a fan of godzilla and this movie to me got me back enjoying the theaters again hopefully they dont try to hard with the next one if there is a next one
"ever since godzilla king of monsters ive been waiting for another clash of titans this delivered in a scale that godzilla v kong failed to it was thoroughly entertaining the new story and creation of skarking was really good and went well with what we knew of the titans ancient battles and rivalries it was also nice to see that the score maintained elements of the previous score rather than ignore it and create an entirely new one i like continuity
so what went wrong the effects are good but they are obviously effects at some points i think theres something to be said for actual props on wires etc having entirely comp generated effects can be visually exciting but if they appear too cartoonish then it goes against the overall feel of the film this unfortunately did have such elements some of the close up shots were so obviously cgi which is where i think they could actually get away with models  mix it up like jurassic parkthe story is told well both above  below the surface but i do put into question why godzilla went through all this for an sm acrobatic oranguatan rather than king ghidora i dont know he didnt really need the super heatthing really but you know it sells merchandise im sure that wasnt the only reason to do it but it seems like a massive factor also i am knit picking slightly but if godzilla was now hypercharged and donning his new pink powers  mega irradiated does that mean that everywhere he made landfall post exposure is now a radiation wastelandalso side note but what the actual f is up with destroying the pyramids ffs leave them be destroy something else the eiffel tower mount rushmorei did decide about mid way that id enjoy watching this again so ill likely do thatbut for now i leave you with this review and this little spoiler kong finally gets his crown woohoo"
this is exactly what i want from the monsterverse titans fighting in large scale battles with the humans taking a back seatkong is the lead here and godzilla takes a back seat this easily could have been a solo kong movie but i understand why it wasntloved the villain loved the battles loved the cinematography and soundtrack its just a super fun time from start to finish and i had a smile on my face the entire timemy fave monsterverse movie so far i hope they continue to expand this universe more and more and keep getting as creative as they please with all of the whacky choices
"it was great to revisit the hollow earth and seeing how weve still only scratched the surface that holds so much potential for future installments i found the brief rematch between kong and godzilla was really satisfying and seeing the return of mothra was great and i had really missed the queen of the monsters and finally seeing the scar king from the first look teaser a while back i definitely recommend this one great monster mash fun with some great monster battles
and always stunning effects which never disappoints the spectacles of the movie seeing the tribe was great and seeing what purpose they serve in the greater hollow earth"
if someone told me  years ago that godzillas return to cinema would lead us into a future team up movie with king kong my inner child would likely loose his mind with excitement i knew gxk was embracing the showa era insanity but nothing could have prepared me for how beautifully wild but simplistic it was seeing it in dx amplifying the experience of every monster fightit is a story of found family building on gvks foundation to characterise its lead monsters kong being the heart of the story as he finds his place in the hollow earth godzilla having presence throughout each scene hes in reminding us why he rules the surface skar king has a lot of aura as a villain too he unironically reflects the darkest parts of human nature both past and presenteven the human cast is fun to hang around with bernies brotherly chemistry with dan stevens trapper makes for good comedy but also the journey that jia goes through in this film also stands out for suremy only real gripe with the movie on a whole was that it had so much of it shown off in the marketing much like king of the monstersi feel honured to be a monsterverse fan and while we dont know what comes next i trust in adam wingard and legendary to lead us into future titan adventures
"the movie itself was shocking incredible it was more screen time on the titans rather human itself this was in fact different between all godzilla franchise we actually see a character development in kong and godzilla with a good slow pacing kong and the main reason he fight with godzilla and a fast pacing godzilla why he became pink human actually became important characters in this movie which is very surprisinglythe movie also has surprisingly fun humour which put a cherry on top with incredible fightwe also got introduced protect at all cost character which it was fun to see and can be a key character in the futureantagonist was good not incredible but not bad either we dont see his background or history a lot but it makes him such a good antagonist against kongi feel like this movie was more about kong so try side and his character development but i do wish to see more of the big baby godzilla the fight could be fast pacing depending how you feel but i do enjoy this this was not just like all fight and win this feels like a stronger relationship with kong and i absolutely feel sympathy towards him and his development even tho i loved godzilla more
but this was incredible movie and cheers for reading"
when i first walked in to go see this film my expectations were low given the last film did not have as great of a plot as other monster verse films though when i left i felt that this film did a great job of giving a good story set in this established universethis film unlike the other monsterverse films does a good job of making sure that the titans get their time to shine on the screen i felt the film was much more focused on them and had a lot more sequences featuring them unlike godzilla king of the monsters and godzilla vs kong and the humans in this movie actually had good sequences and good scenes when they were on screen unlike the last movie which i felt they were just kinda pointless in the whole scenario of things the hollow earth uncharted areas were cool to discover and discover that the iwi tribe had connections to the titans way before anyone else did the titans down there were very well designed and even the titans on the actual earth were very well designed i even liked exploring godzillas preparation for the scar king by gaining and absorbing enough radiation to take him on the humans i felt were good characters in addition to the story and actually had good reason for being involved in the plot unlike the last film or some of the characters just didnt really need to be therei felt the scar king was actually a pretty well set up villain in the story we had some background behind them and what his motives were and we even got to witness him in action which i felt was very cool to witness even discovering the existence of shimo was very cool he was basically just the scar kings puppet and i felt that was very cool to see i felt like scar king had enough motive and reason for being a powerful major threat in this whole film in general i even enjoyed baby kong and his scenes on screen and im excited to see him in the next film i kind of felt even though it is called godzilla x kong i felt kong was mainly the star of the whole film even though i enjoyed seeing his sequences i felt that godzilla was just kind of there and wasnt really balanced out on screen with kong but the final battle really made that better it was a very cool sequence i felt the fight was very well choreographed and the cgi during it was phenomenal as well i am very excited to see where the next film goes given this film had a good story good plot and great cgioverall godzilla x kong the new empire is a very entertaining film it delivers a good story while at the same time giving you great action sequences and gives you a worth of your money it gets an  in my book would recommend to any fan of the monsterverse and godzilla or kong
"i wont say much  will also not spoil it for you guysits complete package of action adventure and fun also comedy timings were great its time to explore hollow earth more now
the only thing i was dissapointed for that the titants were introduced a bit late but yeah never mind coz when they show up they kinda show up its worth the waiti would suggest to experience it on big screenthe thing which i usually never liked in monterverse movies is human interference like what can us puny humans do in between there fighti wont say human interference wasnt a part in this movie but it was limited now the humans have learnt not to go in between when  titants fight just let them deal on there own"
the expectation that this film would be anything better than just ok never crossed my mine my son told me right off dont look at the ratings so i didnt look at any reviews which is something i always do but i figured the ratings were poorwhat a surprise this movie was so much fun from start to finishin no way can you compare this movie to the oscar winning minus one and we all know its not going to win any awards but this is why we go to the movies this is why we love monster movieswhat an amazing experience this movie is guardians of the galaxy meets the monster versesomething i have to admit is ive never been a kong fan with the legendary franchise but this movie changed that for me kong was great in this movie but im always a godzilla fan
i loved this movie what an epic masterpiece of monsters beating each other to a pulp until one is crowned king sort of this was more of kong movie than it was godzilla the cgi was fantastic dan stevens stole the show i forgot how good of an actor he is this is one of the movies that is meant to turn your brain off and just watch monsters beat and rip each other apart we do get more of a backstory on one of the human characters which i like my one and only critique is the final battle scene between the bad guys was longer it only lasted like  minutes in total you could technically call this a sequel to kong skull island
odzilla x kong the new empire  which is currently showing in indonesian cinemas comes with stunning monster action but thats all that can be said about this filmgodzilla x kong the new empire is the sequel to godzilla vs kong  directed by adam wingard this film tells the story of two giants godzilla and king kong as the title suggests who team up to fight the giant ape creature skar king and the giant ice reptile shimoas expected the film tries to keep the audience in suspense with nonstop fighting battle scenes come in striking colors such as godzilla being pink while shimos ice attacks are ice blue visually it brings the audience to a sensation like playing a video gamewhile watching titans fight is fun the action scenes may be the only thing viewers will remember once they return home monster fights can be messy especially the final godzillakong versus skar kingshimo fight due to the flash of light the viewer may wonder what is going on here who attacked whomgodzilla x kong the new empire unfortunately fails to explore the emotions of its human characters this is what differentiates and could be said to be the most obvious shortcoming of the fourth film in the monsterverse this film seems too centered on monster battlesgodzilla x kong the new empire  which is  minutes long actually features human characters who have their own plot for example the relationship between dr ilene andrews rebecca hall and her foster daughter and iwi native jia kaylee hottle theres also the bernie hayes brian tyree henry conspiracy theory although his jokes are only mildly amusingunfortunately the minor characters in the film seem too minor and only serve as additional spice this film tries to explore the mother and daughter relationship between ilene and jia but there are no scenes or dialogues that really touch the audiences hearts in contrast kongs interactions with suko the little monkey monster character give the audience a dose of heartwarming scenes even though they have no dialogue in human language only animal movements and expressionsoverall godzilla x kong the new empire is full of action but the lack of dialogue between memorable human characters makes this film less enjoyable from a narrative perspective
where do i even begin with this this movie started off so what good then the action began it was really interesting and good emotions like a drop on a roller coaster getting the butterfly effect i went with my three husbands four including myself lgbtq community is growing and glad that this movie theater allowed us to live up to the moment the overall experience was amazing especially with my husbands i suggest to bring your special person with you to watch the movie they all looked cute and wonderful wearing legging rubbing on there inner thigh and getting into the mood while the movie was playing i rate it a  it ended off with the bad ape dying and me and my husband jacking off and kissing like a happy ending
ive been a fan of godzilla since i was a little boy and i must say im really enjoying the current big g renaissance that is happening right nowi went in to this one with pretty mitigated expectations the legendary movies have been good dumb fun but have been thus far lagging behind recent toho entries in the artistic departmenti have to say i think this is probably the best one of the bunch legendary has fully and completely embraced the attitude of the late showa era films with a blockbuster budgetat points watching this movie i was reminded of the gleeful insanity of watching destroy all monster or final wars its a gross out gore fest special effects extravaganza that looks at every monsterverse movie thus far and says hold my beer they have now abandon any pretense of seriousness and are leaning into the camp and its perfect exactly where this series needs to go these arent serious or deep characters and lets face it were here for the kaiju and boy do you get plenty of fightsi think this is the legendary movie that works the best tonally and i predict it will become a modern cult classic because it is just joyfully silly and gross and unhinged
i am already a big fan of monster movies and when i can take my year old daughter and she has the time of her freakin life this is a huge win for meis the movie without its problems absolutely not but what movie is this movie is a fun ride the entire way through the set up for the movie is they introduce a bigger threat then godzilla  kong monarch is researching hollow earth kong is searching for more giant apes and boy does he find it godzilla is out powering up a la dragon ball style what does he know that the world doesntat times the movie felt very conan the barbarian but i didnt mind as a matter of fact i dont know why they havent thought of that earlier the big thing i want in my monster movies are lots of destruction cool characters and godzilla  kong to hug at the end i didnt get that part oh well the characters introduced were fantastic brian tyree henry  dan stevens steal the movie also a huge shoutout to kaylee hottle this kid is going places she was amazing in the movieif you want a good movie that isnt  hours long that you can sit and enjoy the movie magic fog that you will be in you will have a great time
no pun intended  but be aware that this is kongs show i think someone did count the minutes screentime godzilla had  and it is not that much actually that said you should also be aware that this is not everyones taste rotten tomatoes has an audience versus critics score that is quite  well there is quite the difference between those twoi also know that a lot of people in germany mostly critics once again really didnt like this i dont know what expectations some people had  i understand to a degree what bothered them  one main thing probably is last years japanese gojira movie  but you cant compare those two this is an us release  in the monster verse and it does what it says on the  well tin i reckonthe characters are quite fun there is a sort of throwback to older gojira movies too with a native people worshipping kaijus kind of backdrop  big drop that is and im quite certain a lot more things along those lines one newer thing and ghostbusters had this too  this also has a hidden same sex love story of sorts in it ghostbusters was way more in your face even though it was never said out loud  here it is more  well nuanced the only thing that plays out in an understated wayeverything else is big and loud with a lot of fights yes even the big lizard gets some action we still stay on track with the big ape there is a new addition late in the game  but only new to this new monsterverse  because it is an old acquaintance to anyone who is a fan of kaijusthat said the effects are good and this works as a not overthinking it just enjoying the visual stuff thrown at me  although there is one big emotional moment and rebecca really sells it great moment after v comes x  well actually it should have been w right lets see what letter they put in between the two monsters next  y you sayask exactly

first of all dont listen to critics if you want to feel comfortable with this film most of the people enjoyed this film  so do i  the film is filled with fun action funny comedy and its not even sleepy even my own grandma is not sleepy  realthe characters too much fun kong and suko and godzilla skar king shimo all of them are balanced and the character development for the humans are also goodminus the film is not long enough and the villain in this movie sadly have a screentime that isnt enough but i can say its okay for a villain screentime not short but they also said the story isnt that deep but im not bothered with itoverall its fun not boring full fight but dont be too focused on the story
for the first  minutes i sat shaking my head because i was bored and fed up of the bad acting by most of the humans and the tedious comedy scenes i honestly dont understand why there has to be comedy in every filmi like rebecca hall and kaylee hottle they were both excellent but thats about it bryan tyree henry and dan stevens were both the comedy element but they were both pointless because this film didnt need comedy at allthe reason i gave this a  is because of the awesome monster fights they were exciting and so well done i love godzilla i have done since i was a kid so ill never say anything bad about him he was awesome king was also brilliant and it was great to see mothra againim not sure what the ice monster was ive never heard of it before i wonder if its already part of the monster verse or just made up for this filmanyway great film apart from the humans
i just got done taking may family to the movies my wife daughter and husband and my  grand kids  and all the adults like or loved the movie my son in law wife and i liked it the most my daughter and grandson said it was good and my granddaughter said it was too loud dme i really liked how the titans took center stage it really felt like an old school godzilla feature to me the fight scenes were great some were pretty fast but they had enough big fight scenes to really give kaiju lovers excitementi dont want to give any spoilers but if you like godzilla movies this ranks as one of the best modern ones its a popcorn movie all the way i will not say its for everyone but for me i hope they make more like this
a really fun sequel to godzilla v kong there was so much action in this film and tons of fights it made for a very entertaining and visually great film i do wish they wouldve hurried up the story a bit more as it took most the film for godzilla to come to kong and i feel like godzilla was a little underwhelming in this too but when he joined kong he was badass kong was basically the main character of this film and he had more personality in this and made for an entertaining character as we explore this new realm and meet new characters the scar king was actually pretty cool he was badass and brutal aswell as shimo who was just awesome the final fight scene was done pretty quick and i feel like it couldve been better but it was very entertaining stuff the lore was all really interesting like the scar king lore and more stuff with how monarch operates there was some great visuals in this too even epic ones like godzilla diving off a mountain into the ocean was so cool the music was pretty great too overall its a really entertaining movie i just wish there was more of it so that it couldve been better super fun though and a great watch
"
i mean you cant lie that everytime all of these monsters are on the screen it was just epic and what fascinating me the most in this one is how good of a execution adam wingard made to these monsters characters that even the scene with only the monsters are very good and really working the personality build works very well and that is the one aspects i appreciate the most and while some of the flaws are still from the human aspects they are not boring and thats the most important i actually can say that i still like all the human characters just some flaws execution and some cgi and special effects could get a bit distracting this is a kong movie to me in terms of who supports who just like godzilla vs kong but im more on the godzilla side on that one in this one the team up the rematch and the final battle was pretty awesome and while i do still like godzilla vs kong more with the reason that it such an event at the time and somehow im more connected to the human more on that the execution was better and again i feel like they actually even cut the human part even more in this one also the final battle between godzilla vs kong was just uncompetetable overall in what most people would think a cash grab and forced continuation story and that might be the case but as long as it delivers and now i see the result godzilla x kong the new empire surprisingly and actually delivers a solid entertaining and epic of a sequel"
i went to the theaters the day it came out and it was awesome the villains are very good loved shimos design the humour was great along with the story designs and human characters the only downside was there was only  named kaiju and i wish there was more godzilla new design has grown on me a lot showing off his new shoulder spikes and tail kings glove was pretty awesome too but he barely had any updates skar king and shimo are also very cool the idea of shimo being controlled by the skar king is awesome the death of skar was also cool af being frozen and smashed to bits is one of the sickest death scenes ever
ive seen it twice and both times i absolutely loved it this movie was amazing and is now one of my ultimate favorite moviesever i highly recommend to everybody to go and see this movie if you havent already hope to see more of the godzilla x kong team in the future loved every second it was fantastic the villain was so creepyscary the visuals were amazing my boy godzilla was not playing around in this movie kong turned way up in this movie it was awesome to see familiar faces and new ones not a second felt wasted or drawn out or unnecessary and it was amazing start to finish
king kong and godzilla are my most favorite movie monsters now the parts with them little kong mothra the scar king and shimu were the best parts i didnt care much for the parts with the human characters except maybe those iwi people who were deaf and could only communicate through sign language also the really best part was the final battle between godzilla kong and the scar king and shimu now im not gonna spoil anymore of this film but i will tell you that this sequel in the monsterverse is worth the watch tons of action and awesome effects not perfect but still a great movie eight out of ten
see it on imax that is my first recommendation get ready to completely suspend disbelief as you go on a wild an whacky journey into pure wonderfully silly megamonster romping they even throw in some titan lore and you do get to see several of the greats beside kong and godzilla do not expect realism that would be ridiculous its just a really fun megamonster movie with wall to wall special effects and cgi kong is probably more endearing than ever and they do a lovely treatment on mothra as well i loved these movies as a kid and i am happy to keep supporting them about  action and only  drama fyi grab that popcorn and enjoy
in the colossal world of monster movies godzilla the new empire stands tall as a true titan of the genre adam wingard delivers a masterpiece that not only honors the legacy of the iconic lizard king but propels it to new heights of greatness a very fun and entertaining movie the visual effects are nothing short of breathtaking with godzilla and his fellow kaiju rendered in stunning detail the pacing is also excellent despite the long runtime the story is as good as the creatures themselves weaving a tale of survival and sacrifice the movies is best watched on the big screen in imax a great blockbuster film overall 
this movie to me was on par with all the avenger movies in fact they took the boring fights and running typically godzilla onedimensional plot and they turned it into a brilliant storyfairy taleadventurethe script is brilliant it is finally a story and well thought out lots of emotion lots of action and many twists no longer it is mekong me godzillame fight and destroy u and buildingsarrarr no it is now a rewatchable story with a great plotgorgeous camera work no shaky cameras beautiful pans of all the scenery you can appreciate all the sfx and the worldbuildinga solid  ill be rewatching it in a couple of year and i cant say that for most movies

it was a great movie and had tons of action scenes they had some great scenes some funny scenes sad scenes but most importantly the villain while the main villain was like a tennis ball it was kind of a weak villain while it was mainly kongs story i wanted more of godzilla because he started the monsterverse it also had about  minute fight scenes for some of them like tiamat he didnt even last  seconds but the good part about this movie is the funny parts the fight scenes and how kong meets his family the final fight scene was amazing the skar king shimo and the great apes fighting kong was great i hope they do another movie
look i get people are mad that its very funny and all with a lot of things happening but like thats not what happened back in the s and s when they made godzilla funny like i loved this movie a lot many of my friends did the human acting was ok and all but godzilla and kong had many great scenes and i really liked most of the lore to it but yeah i get that people also hate it cause they want to compare it to godzilla minus one as well but they aint the same they different really the monster verse is very entertaining and fun and make many fun movies so dont care what anyone says 
i was pleasantly surprised by how quickly this movie brought me into it and kept me swept up in the mythical action sequences that were paired with some great cinematography and acting i was really impressed with godzilla x kong and i felt that it was a thrilling and fun movie that fans of the titan monsters will appreciate the introduction of the mini kong was particularly cute and it reminded me of seeing diddy and donkey kong in action  as a tongueincheek comedic relief and element of surprise thrown into an otherwise compelling story that i thoroughly appreciated i think that it will be a fan favorite in this household
no complaints here never a dull moment and cgi and live are equally tolerable story may not be as great as everyone would think but it was still well written a slight humor and not forced which is good if not better with this type of movie glad its not directed by gunn or waititiloved that mothra returned and introduced new titans both passive allyies and enemies alike good to see jia all grown up a little biti hope they keep making movies like this and never die down the only thing that could stop this is negative reviews from critics who failed as an actor or never became one yall need an actual job fracking losers lmao
ok im biased as i loved godzilla vs kong and loved the preview scenes so couldnt wait for this one and had godzilla x kong rated  stars before i even walked into the theater  but it fully earned that rating it was such a fun movie to watch i read a complaint that there was not enough time with godzilla it was kongs story so naturally the focus was on him but it looked like time between godzilla  kong was evenly split to me if anything the humans took too much time away from both as always the humans were the weakest part of the movie and got in the way of the action but at least they were somewhat interesting this time around the dr dolittle of the monsterverse was pretty funny loved the monster mash fight scenes there was a certain batman vs superman aspect to mothra being the monster that both godzilla and kong liked  lol  the cairo fight was epic if to short and the big rio finish imagine sunning yourself on a rio beach when the monsterverse descends on you was awesome but felt a bit rushed and i would have liked a final godzillakong scene to wrap things up but those are minor quibbles as seeing the big boys join forces on the big screen was a blast and the film was so fast paced it felt much shorter than its  hour run time  the ending set up nice for a sequel and have to say i loved the recent godzilla vs kong vs the justice league comic and if that is where they go next it would be awesome
wow im just as surprised as you are reading this right now believe me my expectations were kind of meh me personally godzilla vs kong gvk was okay nothing special maybe about a so who won this time in godzilla x kong  what is this new empire well legendary studios of courseafter a victorious achievement for toho we all know what weve come for here at legendary studios  the results are definitely not a minus onewow im just as surprised as you are reading this right now believe me my expectations were kind of meh me personally godzilla vs kong gvk was okay nothing special maybe about a so who won this time in godzilla x kong  what is this new empire well legendary studios of courseafter a victorious achievement for toho we all know what weve come for here at legendary studios  the results are definitely not a minus one
godzilla x kong is the best of the showa ear movie of godzilla its a fun ride with monster battles some characters development especially with jia adds to the monsterverse lore of the monsters themselves it knows its goofy and it doesnt shy away from it although this movie may not be recognized at the oscars its still a good flick all in all this movie os dedicated to the older godzilla fans as it has the goofy feel as the older movies if your looking for a serious movie and drama indepth character development than this movie is not for you but you love big monster this is your movie
reading through the reviews its the same every time with these kinda films from marvel to transformers theres those people that will hate on everything they do yet keep going to more films disregard anyone who gave this under  they never saw it or just likes to be negative its so tedious the same arrogance and sabotage on giving big franchises awful scoresthe film itself was great went really quickly the design and the effects were top draw they had a great range of characters who werent one dimensional i enjoyed that a few side characters were more versatile here the fight scenes were great the little girl to be so good with no lines credit to herhonestly i cant understand unless you hate these types of movies how youd not like it
starts off strong and ends with huge bang the effects were crazy the story was great soundtrack is freaking awesome great acting kong was off the chain godzilla crazy good i didnt think i was going to like it but i was  wrong i loved it just wish i would have waited to see at imax theater brother inlaw was in charge of tickets i havent been to the movies in a very long the and i was not disappointed i think i am done with watching at home the theater was awesome i could feel every punch kong delivered and the effects on huge screen were incredible this movie is reason i will be going back to the theaters from now on very glad i went to see it you will love it if you are king kong or godzilla fan it doesnt disappoint
short answer awesome fights and story wasnt bad either loved the action and enjoyed the new titanslong answer i love big kaijus fighting and it was a treat to see what i wanted i loved watching godzilla and kong fight also loved kongs development the story wasnt a complete masterpiece with no errors but it was still great the new characters were great too and it was a blast i was taken to another world which is exactly why we go to the movies not to always see a no error masterpiece but a movie to transport us to another world and entertain us but the main thing this movie has is its action like its the one of the best monster verse movies if not the best in my opinion 🔥💯
this is the only film ive put the effort into watching it in cinema ever since what felt like forever and i dont regret it i really like shrek kong in the beginning him being the main focus on this one sells it for me sorry godzilla the humans story also packed neatly not dwelled too much nor too little i also like how they use underrated actors and not the over saturated ones thank you its not chris pratt again on the other hand i dont really like how mothra became too much of a hacks plot device in this one kinda wish they did more of her and shimo overall this is a really fun and amazing movie i recommend watching it in cinema for the full experience
my buddy kristian harloff from the best entertainment podcast the big thing said it best if youre excited about this movie and you read or hear a review whose major point is in this movie you dont care about the humans disregard it and see it anyway those people are going into this movie with the wrong mindset and they dont really want to see a kaiju aka giant monster movie of course the human story doesnt matter its not their story i also have a counterpoint i did care about the humans they are a great complement to the true stars of this flick godzilla kong and mothra godizilla minus  was an anomaly not even the original  flick had the human story that minus  this is not a comparable flick this movie is so much fun and i am loving this monsterverse including the kurt and wyatt russell led tv series monarch it all started with gareth edwards godzilla in  i eagerly await godzilla and kongs next adventure
ive always been into these kinds of films total guy movies with fights and giant monsters however i find the movie to be too futuristic with this new stage of hollow earth scar king could have been fleshed out a bit more dont know how but i guess thats also why im not a film director i do get surprised though by how they come up with new ideas that dont really have much significance the film lacks of a classic storyline when the end is reached the film series is over this movie was just about killing yet another titan that would threaten humanity i feel like they keep adding more and more with each film so eventually i could imagine the last film not really living up to expectations because theyve simply made the universe too big and dont have the classic storyline
i guess warner bros is learning that people dont watch these movies for the human characters but the monsters instead there are many monster fights and they are all very well done unfortunately they could be much longer especially the final showdownkong is once again our main hero and he sure shows alot of emotion in this movie which i really like it makes him in fact more dimensional than most human characters in this movie speaking about the human characters i dont find the humans in the monsterverse movies as boring as most other people on the internet they are all fine though two of them are to much of comic relief characters which modern movies unfortunately seem to add more and more due to marvels popularitygodzilla is the one that gets most monster fights despite having less screentime than kong those fights are all good but come pretty short i would have liked some more godzilla action godzilla himself acts more of an anti hero like in the last monsterverse movie which works pretty wellthe main villain scarking is entertaining but for sure the least intiminating monsterverse villainwithout his sidekickall in all its a most watch in theaters due to the action and visuals but dont expect this movie to have minus one storytelling atomic breaths
finally the monsters take  of the screen time and thats a really enjoyable ridesure the plot is cheesy and full of holes but lets face irt these kind of movies are there for you to watch big monsters fight each other and tear down cities and on that point it sure deliversthe best thing is the human plot takes a backseat this time around and we really focus on the titans cgi is breathtaking at times and the action pretty relentlessbest popcorn movies of  so far i do recommend it eventho the plot and chartacters are pretty weak thats a tton more fun than this monarch show tho
king kong was my favorite childhood movie after  years when i saw king kong in theaters december  during christmas break with my dad sis and grandma it blew me away godzilla was one of my second favorite movies  godzilla was such a great movie directed by roland emmerich  but gareth edwards godzilla was by far the most remarkable films ever created it was godzillas th anniversary and that was such a treat to see a new godizlla  shin godzilla is the best movie ever created godzilla had a head on his tail and that made him more powerful and he was gonna breed his own offsprings but then he froze  godzilla vs kong was such a remarkable hit  kong skull island it made sense of where he came from and how godzilla didnt know he was out there  but after they came face to face it was mine blowing  i hope they do the final chapter of the monster verse  and godzilla faces the new monster destroyia and godzilla sacrifices himself to save the world and kong dies in new york city as his final battle with the skull crawler 
it is a very good movie but the ending seems a bit rushed and also the titans were too much human impression kongs facial expressions is too much for a non human almost like they are trying too hard to add humour to the movie which nearly destroyed a great piece of work i feel like they havent showed us enough about what happened at the end very little details those details if included wouldve given the movie a chance to get  rating but aside from that everything about the movie is greathavent enjoyed a movie of this genre since the very first jurassic park movie i recommend watching it at night during the weekend
the titans of fun are back in this th entry in the series smartly scaling back the human component we focus on an impending force which has kong curious in center earth while back on terra firma godzilla is making quick work of any rogue titans rampaging around the globe during a skirmish wsome jackal like creatures kong opens a fissure in the ground which leads him to an even lower strata of his world where a young  smaller ape greets him in a failed attempt to jump kong essentially the young primate leads him back to his leaders stronghold where an ice breathing titan is at his beck  call which scientist present rebecca hall a veteranian dan stevens a paranoid blogger oscar nominee brian tyree  halls mute charge kaylee hottle all figure godzilla must partner wkong to defeat this insistent enemy returning director adam wingard keeps the fights between the beasts front  center while all the explaining verbiage is left on the sidelines where it needs to be making this an endurance test for the paying audience on how loud  bright they want their mayhem to come across
i had zero expectations going into this except i wanted to be entertained i was thoroughly if you can just enjoy what godzilla x kong is trying to give you youll have a good time you either know by now if these movies are for you or not so understand this wont change your mind on the genre it is outrageous fictional fun that is meant to be enjoyed with popcorn candy and friends i loved that the movie is pretty much action from the start doesnt really try to over explain anything and just lets you enjoy what its presenting you its not a deep pool but it is a lot of fun to swim in
all ive got to say is if you expected it to be a one big action pack movie you will be absolutely entertained all the way through but if youre like the people that give it low reviews that expect it to be a dark more serious monster movie like minus one youll be disappointed and you shouldnt even be thinking that way in the first place if you just look at the marketing of the movie you would know thats nothing like that at all and for the just under two hour period of the movie i think this was a pretty good one actually i think its the best one for obvious reasons and theres a lot more monsters than human characters which is what we wanted from the start and you see a lot of people saying theres not enough human characters on screen that will give you an interesting enough story they say because its not humans they focusing on like they wanted it to be in the first place

i am slightly relieved that kong doesnt end up eaten by godzilla he did a great job at taking the barbaric beast it was lovely to see kong amongst his peers although i kind of lost the plot on how he was reunited in with them when they were mia in kong vs godzilla i must not have been paying attention but i am sure we were given the suggestion that they went extinct in the first prequal i absolutely loved the humour soundtracks were befitting i didnt quit understand where little zilla came from i am sure godzilla and son is somewhere in the works i expected a little more from tiamat she came to an anti climatic end i wouldve expected to see more of her abilities as her reputation was not becoming of her end hopefully she left an egg somewhere i absolutely loved kongs sidekick despite the fact he was ginger which really reflected his firey spirit we really did come a long way from kong habituating in the jungle to originating from inner earth its a big gap
godzilla x kong the new empire is more of the bombastic craziness youve come to expect from the monsterverseat this point into the franchise you either accept what these films are go with it and have fun or you dont theyre dumb fun switch your brain off spectaclesmost people watch the monsterverse to see giant monsters beat each other up whilst destroying cites  landmarks with great cgi  cool visuals the film delivers on all that i mean we get kong using a child ape as a weapon to smack around some adult apes and then godzilla performing wresting moves on kongthe human scenes do continue to be the least interesting  entertaining parts of these films with the exception of jia and her bond with kong  connection to hollow earth a big selling point of the film is godzilla  kong teaming up but they spend most of the film apart and dont actually team up until the rd act also just like in gvk i felt theyve underused godzilla and not given him much to do especially compared to kongoverall i had a damn fun time checking this out it entertained me and put me in a good mood when it comes to this particular franchise thats all i need
godzilla x kong is bombasticwow go to the movie for spectacular visual effects loud background music and to just have a blastthe story seems illogical and doesnt make sense but the story telling in the movie is good the director has done a fantastic job in not making the movie boring the movie belongs to kong and shows his journey all along godzilla is very powerful thanks to all the radiation he consumes from other titans the battle scenes are epic with stunning visual effects the storyline concerning humans is also nicely presented but it becomes pale to those who have come only to watch monsters fightcoming to the d it is fast and sometimes gives a headache as lot of fast actions are there i had watched in imax theatre and i felt that the quality of d could have been better however the special effects are topnotch the background music with visually stunning scenes begs you to watch this movie in the biggest screen possiblesome scenes like godzilla running and jumping to ocean almost like flying feels unrealistic the human suddenly developing a giant arm for kong godzilla sleeping in the colosseum without breaking it to me it felt cheesy but visually it was beautifulif you have come to watch a movie to have an amazing time without worrying much about logic this movie will not disappoint you
i am not going to spoil this movie for you but i guarantee that youll love it they really captured both characters in full essence the visual effects alone are quite stunning in this movie we went to amc theaters in morrow with the nice reclining seats comfort feel of being at home with all the grandeur of being at the movies something you just cant get at home dolby sound is the way to go you not only get a better sound quality but you will get all the feels to boot our seats where actually rumbling and shaking making you feel like you were there with the characters in the movie it was spectacular
although im not a massive godzilla fan my interests lie more on kongs side i mean ever since watching king kong  my mind has been up its arse ever since i just love it with a passionthe only thing that ruins this latest instalment is the boring human segments and the way the monsters are shownthey dont come across being  feet and  feet and more like human sized does anybody get what im on about heremaybe its the cartoony cgi or the fact the characters now have far too many human characteristics that might be the reason they dont feel like giant sized bastards and wouldnt stand out in the planet of the apes movies well maybe godzy would look odd but that irrelevant to what i am trying to say hereits not a crap film but just just could of done with far less human interaction and better cgibut hey i didnt make this film as well as no other reviewer here did so really we should just enjoy it for what it is and maybe not try to belittle others work and concentrate on the good things in life
godzilla x kong the new empire is a visually stunning sensory extravaganza that presents action payoff after action payoff the film is utterly breathless especially in imax and is a hourandminute amusement park ride the story is clearly made with monsterverse novices in mind but those who are not familiar with the series may find it difficult to envision both titular alpha titans come with decades of builtin lore and those who are first in line are superfans who have memorized every detail the human characters experience shock and confusion from yet another electrical anomaly in a universe where seismic waves and electric currents have factored into godzillas appearances since time immemorial this infantilizes the most passionate audience members and presents a missed opportunity for more imaginative writing while going back to these basics keeps the new empire aligned with the classic mythology the characters should be recognizing these signals from the getgo the story is a missed opportunity for more imaginative writing and may not appeal to those who are not familiar with the monsterverse series the new empire introduces the godzilla above kong below dynamic indicating a mutual understanding between the two monsters kong the main monster is portrayed as human and sensitive showing signs of aging and vulnerability his sense of mortality drives the plot for both monkeys and humans rebecca halls dr ilene andrews who was the strong protagonist of godzilla vs kong becomes a motherlike figure softened by love for her adopted daughter jia and an old college buddy however her opportunities to shine suffer under the heavy weight of the titans as kongs emotions and those of the other apes he seeks out come across stronger than hers this fragile peace between kong and godzilla is not longlasting the recent mocking of godzilla vs kong has led to a reluctance to watch the movie as it has been criticized for its absurdity and the warner brothers cinematic universes poor foundation gareth edwards  godzilla was a dull and serious reboot while michael doughertys  sequel godzilla king of the monsters was unwieldy and poorly executed in between jordan vogtroberts  kong skull island was more entertaining and surprisingly nasty with a better understanding of the tone a bmovie should have the films attempted to establish an interconnected world of citycrushing monsters controlled by monarch but the convoluted dotconnecting pushed us further away from the good stuff of watching giant creatures destroy things the commercial failure of godzilla king of the monsters which barely covered its budget and marketing costs worldwide made warners question their extravagant monsterverse especially after shooting godzilla vs kong before its predecessors release godzilla vs kong a film directed by adam wingard is set to release in the us on hbo max and cinemas in the uk the film initially seen as a bloated and unwanted piece of boardroom product has transformed into a scrappy contender fighting its way from deep beneath sea level to the surface the plot is a frantic way to justify why the two titans would come to blows both of which were previously positioned as protectors of humanity their beef is down to a mysterious threat connected to apex industries a company whose headquarters is attacked by a previously dormant godzilla in the first act his destructive reappearance leads to global concern that he may now be more foe than friend kong living in a controlled tech simulation within skull island is recruited to help by leading a group of humans on a deep dive to the core of the earth the details of the fight scenes are too silly to get into and also of lesser interest than the main question most readers will have how are those fight sceneswhile the misleadingly magnificent trailers for godzilla king of the monsters teased a film of immersive action and sweeping surreal beauty the film itself offered confusing choreography ugly editing and an inability to turn a single stunning image into a sequence of note despite genre inexperience director wingard quickly grasps the mechanics of action far quicker and keeps us grounded while in the middle of chaos the muchhyped battles deliver the giddy thrills we demand but theres also a staggeringly wellbuilt and extensive universe to explore the journey to the core of the earth is a film in itself with visual touches borrowed from both star wars and tron franchises
human screen time is enough but we dont even need humans this is a kong movie not a g x k movie because the movie gave kong too much spotlight that godzilla like a support character because of it as a godzilla fan i have to accept that godzilla screentime in this movie is too boring  beside with the g vs kong  this isnt fair for him scar king is a little bad villian  its too weak that it lose kong  it also smaller than kong tho  it uses too much power of shimo that if there was no shimo  its just a loser  however  it still show it brutal to the monkeys by kill suko mom or smth like thatrate  
"this movie is just like every other monster verse movie junk food and trash writing and thats why i love it the point of the monster verse movies isnt to tell a compelling story about the magic of friendship or anything like that the point is to through a mediocre cgied gorilla and lizard kick assthis movies writing is bad and so are the characters thats also what makes these movies great even though the writing is bad i love it and laugh at it my mates and i could honestly not stop laughing during the movie as it points out the stupid cliches and movie quote tropes that it hasplot 
characters 
writing 
stupidness 
unintended comedy 
total "
this films purpose is to be entertaining not to make the viewer shed a tear or contemplate the characters lore for weeks after watching its a big dumb monster mash and thats good this is easily my favorite monsterverse project theyve ever made because they just went all out skar king was a pleasant surprise as i didnt expect him to be so menacing and ruthless and the design of godzilla is one of my favorites everthe main things that take it down a few notches for me though were the human characters  they were kind of annoying at times but they werent in it too much the best in a mv movie since   and how the sense of scale was lost in most scenes not many of the shots make the monsters look big or imposing and sometimes i couldnt tell what was happening due to it being so zoomed in last negative is that shimo wasnt very scary i love her design and it was very cool to see but she didnt seem like that big a threat compared to ghidorah or even mechagodzillabest part of the movie the supplex hands down final fight was cool as welloverall it is a kong movie with godzilla as the op sidekick who does his own badass side quest super fun and i think if you just let yourself have fun youll love it my inner child was giggling the whole time
i think this godzilla movie is where the script has improved a lot since the  movie the movies script was on the bad side but after godzilla vs kong and this one the script has improved a lot and got what we wanted the most which is we wanted to go see a fun movie about monsters fighting each other which was very fun to do fulfilling all our needs and the excitement of the monsters fighting in the light and seeing their full form was thanks to the production team the cgi that was made came out quite realistic but i want the storytelling in the movie to be better because this is too stuffed
godzilla x kong the new empirethe fifth installment of the fun monsterverse godzilla x kong the new empire is a fun action packed adventure of the usual monster vs monster craziness before i get started here please turn your brains off and be ready for lots of color noise and zappity zap zapthe film is a direct sequel to godzilla vs kong from  with the hollow earth theory finally being proven kong has been bouncing around in there still trying to find more of his kind this has been going on since the skull island movie the iwi tribe is still decimated with the one little girl still featured in the movie i love that dan stevens is in the new movie being quite slapstick and its great to see the beast from the live action beauty and the beast film and matthew from downton abbey being trappergodzilla is doing his usual thing as well but all of a sudden a new signal is detected it causes him to go absorb a bunch of energy meanwhile kong discovers cracks in his new world and he finds more of his kind but they arent quite as friendlyill stop there without spoiling but one can guess that there is mayhem one thing i will say is that the leader of the remaining konglike creatures is totally underwhelming i was expecting much more from a fearsome creature but hes so not scary he only has control of an actual fearsome creatureback to the aforementioned mayhem its actually fun i mean it i had a great time watching all the setup the fights and more fights and the resolution of said fights it was just fun there are no deep moving scenes not much character development so my usual essay on a movie wont be very exciting but just under two hours of fun deserves smiles and satisfactionits a monster movie its fun yes ive said that i recommend it for those who have seen the other four movies and i recommend it for those that havent have fun folks i did
look i never post reviews i am a simple guy who just goes likes to watch movies however i feel like i need to say something about this one we all know how films are now a days critics hate everything that comes out unless it tells to most captivating story that shakespeare himself couldnt have written and audiences generally like things the critics dont like most of my friends and i agree that a movie now is more than likely good when the general critic score is low which brings me to this filmthis is a movie about a colossal radioactive lizard that can breathe atomic radiation teaming up with a giant axe wielding gorilla to fight a lengthy orangutan that yields a giant whip spine and controls a massive ice dragon that have been living in a hollowed out sub terrain of earthhow can anyone in their right mind go into this expecting it to be the next gone with the wind or casablanca this is a movie you watch just to have giant monsters throw hands and have a good time and thats exactly what this film doesi will admit i am a kaiju movie fan i own every godzilla and kong film on dvd yes even the anime and for the record i would not even place it in my top  godzilla films but bias aside this film did exactly what it claimed it would do in this film godzilla and kong team up to fight a newly discovered clan of kongs that is quite literally the title and is exactly what happened now is it a flawless film not even remotely close but the point i want to make is that it did exactly what it set out to do it was never meant to be groundbreaking or invent a new style of cinema that is my biggest reason for leaving this review not every movie has to be the next cinematic masterpiece and both critics and people alike need to understand that not every film needs to be the best movie ever not every film has to be made for everyone to enjoy not every film needs to appeal to everyone if every film is perfect how can you tell which ones truly shineanyways thats my reviewrant if you like watching giant monsters fight watch this movie if not dont go see it and if you dont like those movies but choose to watch it dont leave a review imagine hating the taste of fish going to a sushi place eating their sushi and leaving a bad review saying the fish was bad sounds dumb because it is
the plot of the movie is pretty stright forwardyet quite meaningful  the movie has emotionsaction comedy and everything and watching it in d makes much more sense as you can feel the every punch and action loved the fight sequences but godzilla was shown for very less time however kongs ark was completed next time more of godzilla pleaseloved the sequence were godzilla and kong run side by side my favourite of allhumen character were important and jias ark also got completed and mathras alsonew dentist doctor and old characters were also fun but i am glad this time the focus was more on monsters cant wait for the next movie
sometimes you just need to turn your brain off and just go and enjoy some ridiculousnessthe film got pretty bad reviews from critics because of the wacky cheesy human storyline i was sort of feeling similar but it grew on me because the science fiction elements of this film are really kind of profound most of it takes place in the center of the earth that is actually hollow and is teaming with monsters and theres all kinds of creative creatures and also native humans that live in this realm hollow earthbasically centers around four characters the travel where they find king kong living in this underworld and they summoned godzilla to come down to the subterranean level to fight an evil creature i want to take over the world  i mean ive been following king con for many years starting with the first film of  when was the first king kong releasedive always liked japanese kaiju films anyway theres lots of kind of eye rolling cheesy human comedic dialogue which is a little bit out of place but the film really brought its a game with science fiction and intense monster mayham and actually the characters and comic relief kind of grew on me  bottom line godzilla x kong the new empire is a great science fiction creature feature  the hollow earth design is beautiful and the monster fights are impactful 
i came out of the cinema having viewed gorilla x kong the new empire with my jaw aching having laughed so much at the sheer insanity that had assaulted my eyeballs for the past  hourson the way home my wife and i were discussing how much fun the brainstorm sessions for that movie must have been and how many illicit substances had to have been consumedfrom frame  the movie is nuts but everyone involved plays it with such sincerity it still lands mark hamill once said that no matter how ridiculous the dialogue you have to perform it like you believe it and the cast here definitely live that ethosand by the time godzilla kong and a plethora of god knows whats embark on a massive ruckus in zero gravity you will believe a giant monkey can flysuch dumb fun
i have been patiently waiting for this film for a while and it certainly lived up to my expectations the human and monster roles combined well together and the progression of the story worked almost perfectly godzillas evolved form was amazing the journey through the hollow earth was an incredible experience scar king and shimo were both awesome antagonists and how she was freed from skar king and killed him was a perfect ending i loved the advanced technology used in many things in the movie kong and his interactions with the other primates worked perfectly including his meeting the baby kong id overall say it was a slight improvement over gvk i look forward to where the monsterverse goes next especially exploring more of the hollow earth or discovering new titans it would have been great if the film was maybe  minutes longer or contained more classic characters from the franchise
monkeys are awesome lizards are cool but when you make them big and put them in one movie golly gee you got me hooked big butterfly was dope indeed the monkeys were very reminiscent of a dream i had once i was in a jungle and i had many animal friends one was much like the large villain of this movie but he was a king wait the villain was a king too nvm on that last part there was also a big snake that hypnotized me like the song by biggie there was also a bear in my dream he was pretty cool i think my dream was just the jungle book yk what this movie is like the jungle book with godzilla thats pretty cool
i seen this movie twice already i enjoy it the only parts its letting me down is shimo acting like an over sized dog with no character like godzilla and kong has not get me wrong i love the monstersver as a whole its a great movie if i watch a monstersver movie its possible a mix of godzilla king of the monsters and godzilla vs kong fan a little serious and world building i prefer the monsterver over the mcu right now on fun and interesting movies long side my other favorite franchise overall i enjoyed the toho and legendary godzilla movie but its also fun watching two different characters of the same monster and kong he had character growth from kong skull island to gxk
very great effort by the whole movie team i dont know why these movies are not getting more credits than some other movies like marvelsetc this movie team is doing whatever best to the screen eventhough they are not recognised better so sad to see itvery neat presentationlinked with ancient world varios new things introduced in this movie very nice experience to see this in d theatergiven importance to godzilla and kong shows the real power of godzilla and kong this movie keeps us eager to see the next scenes everything well explained better than godzilla vs kong moviewe like it very much our children likes it on a top of other moviesthank u movie team
for a long time my favorite monsterverse movie was the first one from  kotm was good but i never liked how overdramatic it was godzilla vs kong  on the other hand was great with some interesting dynamics and i loved jia now before godzilla x kong new empire was released i wasnt as excited as in old times for a new monsterverse film but i thought it had potential i decided to watch it in cinema along with an amigo friend of mine we saw it yesterday and we both liked it it was a blastfirst off people say that the human characters in the monsterverse are bland but for me personally in this film the main ones were actually good three of the cast from godzilla vs kong  are back in this film like bernie the comic relief of the film and i enjoyed them i liked how they helped kong in the last rdkong himself in this film was like kratos from god of war he was also along with that little kong and it reminded me like the god of war norse saga with kratos and his son atreus and it was great to see godzilla in the film was kinda hardly in the film because he was busy in protecting the surface world while most of the film was in hollow earth where kong wasin the film the characters in hollow earth also manage to find jias original family and race now i think that jia is the best human character of the monsterverse because of how much she cares about kong and that she can communicate with him sign languageand man mothras return was quite a surprise and joy to watch after  years mothra is back and better than ever i love the scene where jia meets mothra in front of the others and i love how jia and mothra work together to help godzilla and kong to defeat the evil kong the scene where godzilla and kong are meeting mothra with jia putted a big smile on my facethe last third is now my favorite last third of any monsterverse film and the ending was good if i consider this to be the last monsterverse film then its really not bad for a conclusionmy favorite monsterverse filmand mothra is best kaiju and the best waifu
godzilla x kong  the new empire may sound like erotic fan fiction written by a kaiju obsessive but its actually the th instalment in a decade spanning how time flies franchise s godzilla finally brought the legendary lizard to hollywood in a way that wasnt a complete embarrassment but struggled to marry the disparate parts of family drama and giant monster smackdown skull island was a fun mystery island adventure king of the monsters went for epic end of the world monster stakes and godzilla vs kong leaned into the silliness of it all this film takes the ridiculousness of its predecessor and runs with it and runs and runsthe plot such as it is involves a villainous giant ape named the skar king imprisoned in the hollow earth attempting to conquer the surface world dont worry if that sounds like a bit of an underwhelming opponent for big g the nefarious simian has an ace up his sleeve there are plenty of other big monsters for our titular duo to throw hands with and an undiscovered civilisation for the human characters to interact with in terms of story its up there with the most batshit of the toho movies but where those films just let the audience accept the wacky godzilla x kong spends a little too long trying to justify itselfmore than any other of the monsterverse entries the titular monsters really are the main characters of the film or more specifically king kong is while the pair are both basically superheroes here godzilla is the powerful wildcard to kongs leading man its the natural decision given the ease with which human characteristics can be applied to a big ape and director adam wingard leans hard on this angle whether hes wincing with tooth ache or swaggering through the jungle with his chest puffed out like a multistorey chad kong is for all intents and purposes a giant really strong human being likewise skar king smirks and laughs his way through his screen time and scenes with him kong and any other apes play out like wordless human interactionswith the giants able to convey the movies emotions it doesnt leave the human cast with much to do beside take on the role of comedy relief the always likeable brian tyree henry returns as monster podcaster bernie and he is joined by dan stevens proving once again he is one of hollywoods most underrated stars as he brings the most laughs playing a zany adventurerkaiju vet theres also a fun turn from alex ferns most known in the uk for his role as abusive eastenders husband trevor some twenty odd years ago the serious acting is left to rebecca hall returning as kong expert dr ilene andrews this means that while everyone else is horsing around shes stuck delivering exposition and making sure we know she really cares about her adopted daughter hall is up to the task and sells it all gamely but theres no escaping the fact it feels like she is in a completely different filmrealistically any time a person is on screen theyre just filling time until the next monster fight the beast on beast violence comes thick and fast and while a couple of the encounters are disappointingly short or happen mainly off screen the ones that deliver really deliver the sense of scale the earlier movies had is diminished by the hallow earth setting and light on their feet monsters but in its place is some insanely innovative superhero fighting the final way showdown begins in hollow earth zero gravity before exploding onto the surface world as the massive combatants unleash fists teeth whips axes power gloves and deadly breath rays on each other in a crowd pleasing smackdown that pays homage to the classics while taking the spectacle to a whole other levelgodzilla x kong plays to the bleachers with more or less every scene designed to either make you laugh or marvel at the action and while it isnt high art it is in its own way very innovative keep them coming please rotten titan canines removed out of 
i loved the way that the fights had been focused onvery good fights and im waiting for the next battleseveryone at cinema was vibrating with the battles and enjoying the scenesthe last movies was focused much on human history instead monsters they improved a lot this timenext movies i really hope that the production of the movie continues focusing on the monster battlesthats what we are going to the cinema see big monsters fighting with much blood and huge screamsplease do not follow the especialized criticism they dont know anything about fighting big monsters hahahah
"godzilla x kong the new empire is finally the movie everyone was waiting to see after the disappointment i felt in godzilla vs kong i got my eyes back with healthy and hard fights finally they understood that in these films the majority of the duration must be occupied by the titans that is the protagonists they finally figured it out even if there are some nice mistakes as in the entire monsterverse saga the special effects are great but in this movie i noticed a huge improvement the photography the setting and the direction are beautiful as well as the many emotions present the action level is incredible and exciting with every punch being dropped by the characters my smile was printed on my face the new titans in there are beautiful and they really got me going also finally after the in my opinion failure of the film that inaugurated this monsterverse godzilla here you see the true power of the titan with all its explosiveness now to the mistakes the plot initially seemed as simple as i wanted and good entertainment but then as always they went to ruin with the inclusion of mythology at random horrible senseless and poorly explained also another thing that i didnt like are the actors sometimes the situation had become a bit embarrassing excluding brian tyree henry who always makes so much smile one thing that i liked is the comedy many scenes have led me to smile so much if they have to go on as i think they do with the saga i hope they will do it with this level or maybe improving so far godzilla x kong the new empire is for me the best movie in the saga
rating "
this movie contains tons and tons and tons of action the cgi in the movie is incredible for an only  million budget the comedy in this movie is really good even if its sometimes hard to make you laugh at a movie this one might get you in one scene kong find a baby monkey but the baby monkey attacks him and so do some other giant apes but kong grabs the monkey by his legs and hits the other apes with the baby monkey and throws him around which in my opinion is really really funny the movie doesnt quite earn the  out of  but it definitely is my favorite movie of the year great movie
very minor spoilersthis is a really fun action spectacle film to watch with friends and family the cgi for godzilla and kong looks beautiful scar king and the frost lizard have really colorful and interesting designsthe human story seems to get better with every new monsterverse movie and this is no exception the relationship between jia and dr andrews is compelling brian tyree henry and dan stevens are hilarious and provide some great comic reliefthe music is nice to listen to even if it doesnt always fit the sceneits biggest weakness is that it doesnt do anything particularly new just puts tropes into a different context the movie is very entertaining
wow i wow this movie was great it was a blast and i was extremely hyped during the entire movie the humans were ehh very mediocre acting but i found trapper quite hilarious and entertaining even if he was a bit odd and had some npcesque dialogue sometimes bernie is just okay he had some great moments especially when the pilot guy got eaten by a tree a literal tree it was hilarious and genuinely made me flinch from how loud the sound effects were in that moment as well as the random suddenness of it ilene was a pretty alright character her writing was alright she had great moments too i know i just forgot now jia and the iwi was a pretty good arc of the movie even though we didnt really need it especially with how short the movie is i know this would be weird but i wished the movie was  hours long its long yes but it would flesh out the backstory and lord behind the titans and more titan action too maybe have some better writing for the part where kong gets his robotic fist project powerhouse should have clearly been explained in the epilogue of the movie heck even the novelization but no so overall the human part and overall writing was okay and all over the place which is expected its not minus one its supposed to be based off the showa era of tohos gojira but this is not at all close to the insanity of the showa era but still extremely fun i was at the edge of my seat and was screaming damn every titan action scene great visuals mid writing and extremely good action i recommend this movie a lot for people who enjoy random lore and action being thrown all around the place in a proper way thoughand godzilla was extremely brutal here my guy legit obliterated scylla and used her own leg to stab her in the face while he performs the kiss of death also to tiamat damn that was like  seconds of screen time for her crazy it did make sense read the comic godzilla dominion for it to make more sense and also her home was the most powerful source of natural radiation at the time plus tiamat is a destroyerclass even more sense godzilla was throwing hands damn i also loved how he just wakes up beats the crap out of everyone and goes back to sleep at the end amazing about his design it is amazing i love millenium gojis design which is probably pretty controversial but yes i do and seeing the pink dorsal plates and breath it was so good and a lot more visually interesting than regular old blue which i still like i do wish the fight in rio was set in nighttime for a great lightshow he also had very little screen time which i think is fine because all his appearances were amazing and also the fact he turns into thermozilla but by his own and way weaker and just spams atomic breath all over skar king was great and wingard im waiting for the godzilla x kong sequel with gman as the mc and not kongnow about kong he was such a good main character had great development and everything his relationship with suko was exactly like kratos and atreus all his fights were great and a lot of the things i had to say for goji applies to kong as well he was great with a great design his only flaw is the infinity gauntlet thing which was out of place but cool i still like it and the way he just punched the yapping monkey straight in the damn face was hilarious had me spitting out my drink everytime i saw it on yt and of course in the theaters for the other characters howeverskar king what a great and shortlived villain he was amazing menacing and i think was the only mv villain with personality his list of crimes is absolutely insane and i get why he has a whiplash of course he does hes a slave master with a different fur color from the rest of the great apes god he is amazinghis design was badass he was slim and had a huge wingspan arms and his blue eyes were menacing the way he laughed at kongs silver tooth and then got karma at the end was hilarious i wish the movie was longer just for this guy i love him and his design absolute toptier mv villain so far and the way he was so scared and leaping around rio while goji spammed his ass was damn hilarious also this guy legit has a whole army of baby kongs just like suko which explains the one ape holding their baby titan which was orange just like suko and skarabout shimo she looks amazing you could tell the pain and agony from her roars and resisting as she was chained up by skar king and mind controlled its crazy how tall she is and how huge and long her body is wish we got more of her and the end with kong riding her and petting her under her chin and comforting her she was just waiting to be freed from skar king and kong helped her with that but godzilla literally just went back to sleepgreat movie only some minor flaws but i just wanted to see dumb funas an actual mv fan who doesnt just base every godzilla movie off minus ones greatness and ranks them low i feel pretty offended by people who dont know anything about godzilla on yt and those critics dont listen to them if you like a dark and gritty movie go for g and g if you like dumb fun and action watch gkotm gvk gxk kong si and the showa eragoodnight or morning or afternoon thanks this is my first movie review
if you are looking for intellectual stimulation then you are looking at the wrong movie however if you want get special effect excellent cgi and something that is entertaining and fun then this is the movie for you continuing the reboot where godzilla and kong are cast as titans from an ancient past they end up eventually teaming up to beat an old foe it certainly is a big screen movie as that is the best way to appreciate the special effects while it could work as a stand alone movie it would be better to have seen the previous movie godzilla versus kong so that much of the context of the movie makes more sense overall though it was a lot of fun
i really liked this movie a continuation of the one made during the pandemic and much more than the first it entertained me it went by quickly it has very good animation and special effects it makes me want to go see hollow earth in this film in its opening scenes we see kong sad for being alone with a terrible tooth pain on the other hand godzilla who protects the planet from multiple catastrophes his favorite place to sleep being the roman coliseum and on the other hand we see to ilene trying to help jia have a normal life however jia feels like she is not part of this world on earth a help signal begins to be detected from some undiscovered site in hollow earth which is also detected by godzilla who tries to reach it and destroys the world a little in its path there we discover  new worlds that will change the lives of kong and jia and the other humans these worlds open the way to an entire multiverse called monsterverse kong really will always be my favorite of the  as i feel like he has a more sensitive side and that its not all destruction but also helping in the end we see that he found a new nonlonely home just as jia manages to discover her life goal however always at ilenes side this character is a true inclusion they will almost certainly make a sequel since it has a very good box office what strikes me most about these films is how with so few dialogues they can say so much which shows us that language is not just verbal it is something more universal the world of the iwi is fascinating i hope they manage to expand it further
"boyboy this movie is amazing
not surprising about the box office success i mean gahdamn it deserves every cent of itand good news too legendary ceo just confirmed that the future of the monster verse is looking goodmeaning more monster verse movies are up for grabsblue pinkred whatever just keep em cominggodzilla
love kongs gauntlet and beard gave him a badass lookshimo boy am i excited to see the ogs lining up
the action is crazythe storyline pretty not much to it as it should bemore monsters fight and less human bs
just the way i like itcounted every minute until its release and i wasnt disappointed
i can proudly suggest this movie to whoever
best movie of the s ever"
hopefully any that appear in the future will have their different entrance soundtracksi really like the aboriginal japanese music when godzilla appearsthe soundtrack for king kongs appearance should be matched with the music of the indigenous people of south americait is also hoped that future films will feature more of the ancient titans featured in the earlier filmsand i hope to learn more about the grudges and grudges that existed among the titans hundreds of millions of years agoi also hope that the plots of future movies will explore more issues of environmental protection natural changes and human beings in the natural world
"woooo this one is a doozie so i love this movie but thats pretty much granted since im already a monster fan however i think this movie does way more than just good enough and id wager that most people would be able to enjoy it pretty fine i think theres really only  significant points of criticism which do hurt the movie but i dont think any of them ruin itthese are
human drama is once again lackluster in most parts which could be a stark contrast against godzilla minus one which though i havent gotten the opportunity to watch it yet i hear has some pretty good drama but id say its still better in this area than godzilla vs kong which isnt a high bar but its the closest film to this one so its still an improvement jia and andrews relationship is the least awful and at moments its even good i find trapper to be charismatic enoughthe character of bernie hayes particularly draws the human scenes down and so does all the jargon and nonsense scifi or more accurately scifantasy talk that comes with him strangely i only found this ridiculous scifantasy aspect of the film disturbing only when he tried to explain it i guess thats kinda what they were going for but it was still not great in other areas when this movie does something ridiculous it always leads to something so awesome that youre perfectly willing to get on board with ittheres a little bit too much screaming yeah im a godzilla fan and a monster fan and i still think so i usually even love the roaring in these movies but there really is so much roaring that it ends up becoming somewhat desensitizingbesides these points the film does pretty much perfectly everything that you could expect it to do so why do some people continue to keep looking down on it i have no idea but i think their expectations are just not appropriate we already had godzilla vs kong and right down from the title to all the trailers it was pretty obvious that this one would be more of the same in fact im not sure if it could possibly be more obvious what this movies appeal is then why do critics come into this movie expecting a clever plotline and more outrageously maybe even political and social commentary as true godzilla films have done yeah im aware that just because a movie has lots of monster action and spectacle that does not mean the movie cant play for people who are more concerned with intellectual aspects but it still stands that this movie was not going to even aim to have that why expect it why hold it to that standard i have no idea i just know that if the next monsterverse movie is once again made by adam wingard and is advertised similarly to this film you wont like it if you have expectations of a film like interstellar or the martian or even shin godzilla so please just dont see it unless you just enjoy seeing movies you think are bad"
godzilla x kong the new empire brings an epic clash of titans to the screen boasting jawdropping visuals and adrenalinepumping battles the films intense action paired with impressive special effects creates a cinematic experience that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats while the storyline may lean towards predictability the sheer spectacle of witnessing these iconic monsters go headtohead is undeniable its a mustwatch for fans of the franchise and those seeking blockbuster entertainment whether youre rooting for godzilla or kong this film delivers an exhilarating ride that will satisfy your craving for epic showdowns
this has to be one of the most inspid and zany film ive laid my eyes upon this has got to be a effing joke rightboth the main characters are wasted and felt like underutilisedthe human cast was mostly garbage especially bernie he was obnoxious in the previous movie and remains the same in this one instead dan stevens could have been give more screen timethe cgi is very poor and rough in some scenes and its glaringly obviousthe most repulsive thing about it is the monsters dont move or fight like monsters rather inflated balloons no weight no impact no earthquake nothingalso the fight scenes were extremely short and uninteresting why else would someone would want to watch a movie of big monsters if they dont fight for a considerable amount of timewell i guess if you let a low budget garbage tier scholcky horror movie director handle your tentpole blockbuster franchise this outcome isnt all that surprisingbut hey if i point out the flaws instead of gobbling down nonsense then i am public enemy number  right
no major spoilers just what you should be expectingthis was epic nothing like what christopher nolan or some avatar stuff and i am all in for that this movie scratched the most sensitive part of my brain in a great way the cgi is done amazingly well and i never thought id see kong smirk but i didits good to watch an easy movie like this which is just action action and action the soundtrack is amazing as usual the hollow earth shots were amazingi really want to appreciate the directors and the teams imaginations who created all the unique creatures which had their own looks and styleskong was the main focus and godzilla felt more like a side character but in my opinion godzilla stole the show whenever he appearedin the end watch it loud big and with a crowd its worth watching if you are into getting entertained by watching movies which are larger than life
i have a lot of patience for movies like this i love a mindless kaiju flick but this was messy hot garbage i couldnt finish it and that was after an hour and a half it is mind boggling to me that visually most of the film looked like a trailer for a playstation game circa  with a budget of  million utter madness and inexcusable where did the money go not on the cast not on the incredibly sloppy script i like dan stevens but hes not that expensive and wasnt at his best if you really want to watch a mopey ginger ape derp around for two hours with useless background humans who never seem to understand the plot themselves go for it i guess lame
im honestly surprised this movie clocked in at only  hour and  minutes it felt like  hours watching it this movie suffers from the current trend of having every conversation take place in a new setting the green screen paradox if you will everything was you liked that well here is twice that mostly wo explanation  one hollow earth how about hollow hollow earth or lets spend a few minutes showing off this cool camouflage that we wont use but it looks cooleach kaiju battle needed to take place in a new city because how many pyramids are there or were therescar king was super cool but why were they mining the earth again it just looks sort of cool and gives you a chance to see scar be scar but what were they doing no explanation that being said you understood the shimouscarr relationshipcasting wise trapper was played by not bradley cooper and the pilot was not jack black ilene tried to channel kristen wig etc etc felt like jumanji at timesin the end its a godzilla kong buddy movie fishts were fun ans scar was legit opponentnext movie well discover jias twin sister or shell be clonedworth a matinee ticket
godzilla x kong the new empire delivers an outstanding kaiju battle and an epic adventure to the hollow earthfor the first time this is the monsterverse film that uses a plot twiststhe story is all about two distinctive plot points one for kong and one for godzilla kong focuses on the hollow earth while godzilla taking advantage on the surface of the earth jias vision gives a glimpse of a hidden threat within the hollow earth monarch team of dr irene and kong along with trapper dan stevens searches for it in the hollow earththe adventure continues as they explore the hollow earth they witness one of their outposts was destroyed by none other than skar king which has a mark of a handprint the glimpse of mothra in stone wall gives me goosebumps dr irene thought that jia was the last of iwi tribe the iwi tribe gives them a background history about the kaiju war of skar king and shimo i really like the fact that godzilla is the one who imprisoned themthe movie has different fights and it was all epic with gorgeous vfx godzilla fights scylla and tiamat kong fights drownviper and other related apes the fight scene of skar king and kong in the ape lair with lava was goosebumps the evolution and power radiation of godzilla in this film is super awesome the way how he absorbs energy the more powerful he becomeswhen the two level up to their power levels skar king and shimo along with other ape army seeks for the blue portal that exists through the hollow earth godzilla fights kong egypt mothra returns through rebirth and diffuses the fight then the trio go to the hollow earth portal and fight in a zero gravitythe climax is full of kaiju mayhem and good ending the plot twist of this film is shimo who was controlled by skar king is not a true villain she was just suffered by skar kings command and she got revenge by freezing the cruel kaijuoverall it was worth to watch and it was so fun perfect kaiju movie
