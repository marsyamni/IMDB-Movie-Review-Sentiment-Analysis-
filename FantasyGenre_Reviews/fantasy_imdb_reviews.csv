Lots of fun but G movies are becoming too cheesy...sigh,"As a hard-core Kaiju fan of many years, I love that we are being treated to all of these Godzilla movies as of late. My opinion of the first two in this series (Godzilla and Godzilla: King of the Monsters) is that they were (somewhat) reality based and not obviously made for children. My criticism of G v K (the ending in particular) and this movie is that so much of it is far-fetched and fantasy based. Much more cartoonish.The bottom line is, they're making the monsters out to have too much human intelligence when they should actually be more animalistic. This was like watching a superhero movie and in my opinion, making the monsters out to be superheroes is a huge mistake. That's what happened when Toho did this in the 60's/70's which resulted in Godzilla movies becoming silly, low-budget kids movies, which has since been ridiculed for decades and has tarnished Godzilla's image. I understand the writers are trying to be creative and give the fans something different from all of the other monster movies out there, but this can be done without all the cheese. Please stop making the monsters so human!I enjoyed the movie but have to admit that I am somewhat disappointed.",6
"Please, just remove humans from this","Monster = hurrah
Humans = garbageAnother Monster-Verse installment to the collection gave me another reason to visit my cinema. Luckily, I wasn't disappointed, I got everything what I expected which might be summoned by the two equations above.About humans:
If you want to watch the movie at home, don't waste time on humans subplot. It's completely pointless. The dialogues aren't funny or smart. They serve poor exposition which is painfully exhausting to watch. You see the monsters fighting and these ""characters"" are explaining in between: oh, he is protecting! - Come on, who wrote this? In my opinion if Legendary Studios wants to include humans, they should at least try making them just little interesting or just remove them completely. None of them is doing anything necessary, furthermore whatever they're doing doesn't make any sense. Why the hell are they in the Hollow Earth without protection? One guy is just in a Hawaiian shirt. The amount of dangerous monsters is not alarming, I guess... Paper Boy is filming everything but the British guy in a Hawaiian shirt says something like: It's better to keep it in a secret, this ancient civilization shouldn't be exposed to our world. The girl from Godzilla Vs. Kong (she is from that world and has weird X-Men power (?)) is among modern people, so the world already knows the underground world. What does he want to hide? There is more of this stupidity.About the monsters:
Kong is the lead. His journey is simple, he feels lonely, he wants to have a family of his kind. From the trailers you know, there is more giant apes, so I am happy to see them because I am Team Kong :) I'd want to appreciate the ""dialogues"" between Kong and this little ginger fella. They don't use words as we do but believe me, these two are more interesting than the humans. You will enjoy it.Godzilla and the rest are just monsters. Sadly Godzilla isn't intimidating in this movie, his only goal is to gain the pink level of nuclear power and then use it to fight the bad monkey. However, the fight scenes are awesome - this is why we are watching this type of movies, so if you're a fan of giant monsters, I recommend Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire... and don't expect to see raise of ""the new empire"" in this movie. It's a kinda awkward title generated by ChatGPT.",6
Project Powerhouse,"Lots of Titans fighting. That's why we go to something like this, right?G X K is about the same for entertainment wise as G vs K, though I'd give the newest entry a slight edge for a couple of reasons. For one, there's a bit less silliness. There's comic relief of course, but it's not out of place or goofy. The 80's throwbacks with the tunes, synths, and vibes were great. And lastly, the Titans were back to being the bad guys instead of humans. I always find it a bore when you watch a movie about monsters fighting, but have to bare through a story of human villains and their idiotic ideologies.A side note, it's hilarious that these Titans seem to really enjoy having their royal rumbles in the biggest cities on the planet, or while destroying some of the world's most revered structures. Like really guys, you couldn't have thrown down in the middle of the Sahara? More destruction equals more entertainment I suppose. Also, Godzilla just casually murders hundreds if not thousands just walking around from point A to point B. I digress. Go pink Zilla!",7
"A brainless, but (mostly) entertaining monster mash.","Releasing merely weeks after the critically and commercially acclaimed ""Godzilla Minus One"" won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects is a boon as well as bane for ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" - while more people are familiar with the behemoth radioactive lizard, there is an undeniable urge to draw comparisons between the two movies. Adam Wingard's second Monsterverse film following 2021's ""Godzilla vs Kong"" delivers satisfying Titan action, but overall, the film feels like a step back, largely owing to dull and tedious human drama.Personally, I found ""Godzilla vs Kong"" to be the best Monsterverse film. It embraced the absurdity and silliness of its premise and made the most of it to deliver one hell of a show, placing the Titans front and centre, while jettisoning any unnecessary human drama. ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" starts off much slower, with the actual plot taking nearly 20 minutes to kick in. Combined with an uptick in uninteresting human drama, this slows down the movie with certain portions feeling boring.Much like its predecessor, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" struggles trying to the connect the stories of the two leading titans. Kong is the heart and soul of the movie, with Godzilla largely feeling like an accomplice or sidekick. The first half of the movie is almost entirely about Kong's exploration of Hollow Earth, the subterranean ecosystem where the Titans live. While learning about the mystical world was engaging and intriguing, it lead to a delayed introduction of the villain, leading to the third act feeling slightly rushed and less rewarding compared to the enthralling finale of ""Godzilla vs Kong"".The action sequences themselves are a whole lot of fun, with a face off in hollow earth with gravity slightly messed-up being one of my favourites of the entire franchise. The finale in Rio delivers plentiful excitement and fun too.""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is best suited for fans of the Showa era. For Kong fans(like myself), there is a lot to like about the movie, owing to the humanisation of the great ape. The action scenes are fun, colourful and campy, similar to it's predecessor, but an increased focus on human characters and a slower pace make this a slightly underwhelming entry to the Monsterverse.",6
"This movie should be called Monkey X Kong, which is more appropriate","The movie features very few scenes with Godzilla, only a few fragmented shots, including the final battle. Godzilla's total screen time is probably less than 7 minutes. The movie is filled with monkeys throughout, making it more like an independent Kong film because it barely depicts Godzilla, with Kong having far more screen time than Godzilla. I feel like Godzilla's role was forcefully added and feels disconnected from the rest of the movie. Also, the portrayal of SHIMO is superficial, failing to showcase its power, while Skar King is portrayed as a clown; it can't even defeat King Kong one-on-one, lacking a strong antagonist that leads to a rushed conclusion of the final battle. Finally, I have a big question: why do the director and writers like monkeys so much?",6
A bit of a Disappointment,"It serves up a berserk dreamscape with plenty of payoff to please the MonsterVerse faithful. Shame about the human stuff, though. Director Adam Wingard has a lot of fun with textures, colors, and camera work, and he's adept at giving fans the over-the-top monster action that they demand via an imposing new villain. Unfortunately, there's no time to spend on making things make sense or even matter all that much, and what few emotional punches are thrown lack the necessary wind up to connect, save for some very well done moments between Kong and his Hollow Earth kin.Overall didnt live up and the plot was mediocre at best.",
Big Budget B-Movie,"When me and my friends went to see the movie, i really enjoyed it but friends went over the moon for it. They gave it a solid 10/10, so for the audience that doesn't want anything serious - this is hella perfect.The story wasn't anything new that we haven't seen before but it serves the movie good. My biggest problem with it, was the human characters. Just like ""Godzilla vs Kong"", the characters are flat and i would rather watch monsters fight than them.The direction by Adam Wingard is pretty good. The action in particulat is really well done and you can really see what's going on.The actors were OK for the most part but for the script they are given, they are fine.Giant praise to the VFX. Everything looked amazaing and you can see that the money went in the place, not like ""Captain Marvel 2"" for example, which had a 300 million dollar budget and for the money, it looked awful.The music is good too. I wouldn't buy a soundtrack but it served the story.Overall if you just want to have fun for 2 hours, this movie is perfect.",7
Ummm..what?,"What's with all these 9 and 10 stars reviewers?????? It's now they paying people to give movies high praise???I went to cinema and i feel so uncomfortable the whole almost 2 hours time.The comedic thing put on the movie make this looks so cringe and corny!What? They want to transform the Monsterverse into a joke like Marvel? And the humans in this movie are all cringe, whyyyyy? Why they allow to transform every movie into a bad cringe/corny comedy? I don't want to see cringe/corny, i want to se some seriously dark movie about big monsters.4 stars just for some very decent special effects and that's all! THE 2014 VERSION ""GODZILLA""(2014) WAS the best! As well as the Kong: Skull Island! Now they transform Kong and Godzilla into some bad comediants! Don't listen to these 10 stars reviewers!",4
Godzilla sells out to be more commercially viable,"This movie has a real problem - It tries to cater to a wider audience by adding more 'Marvel type' action and storytelling rather than focus on doing what it could do really well and appeal to a more niche audience.The ""doing what it could do well"" part I am referring to is the BIGNESS of the Kaiju's / monsters. Not just their actions but their presence and size.. a bit of slowness in how they walk and move, to feel that ""thud"" when they take a step and the sheer overwhelming presence that they represent - Like in Pacific Rim or in Godzilla King of the Monsters. You FEEL the bigness and the size.A splash in the ocean can causes huge tide-waves due to the size.A resounding BOOM that is felt when two Kaiju's collide.Where is that?There is no respect paid to the bigness.It's just they took some superhero action sequences and applied them to giants and made them move like they were the same size as humans.There is no FEEL or BIGNESS - It's simply a 6 out of 10 movie because it caters ""enough"" to enough people because it goes for what's popular and throws a lot of it while giving away the depth and the ""feel"" of a big monster movie that is what godzilla is meant to be.",6
waste of time and space,"Without spoiling the movie: this was absolutely a waste of money.Yes Kong and Godzilla are in there and some other titans but epic battle? No!It gravitates towards avatar-esque mystical mumbo-jumbo. Tries to copy from many other movies, like music scenes from Guardians of the Galaxy; Jugnle danger from Jumanji; indigenous people mythology from Avatar; epic battle like Planet of the apes;Special effects did not wow me any second, maybe that's a good thing because everything else we see nowadays is just completely AI generated.If your kids want to go see it by all means, but otherwise it's a big let down.",4
A worthy entry in the MonsterVerse,"I don't know what I expected going in to see this at the cinema, but it wasn't this. I guess I expected more focus on the humans (again) and less on the Titans (again)...but this? This was not that. Yeah they had humans, but they were mostly more of a footnote in the story, which could have been almost completely told without the humans, but they did add a little flavour to the mix. Especially Dan Stevens. But then I AM kinda biased towards him as I've loved his work in everything I've seen him in so far.All that aside, Kong was great - and MASSIVE - and Godzilla was pretty damn impressive, too - and just as massive as Kong - but more than that, we got a look at a few other Titans as well, and they were ALL pretty impressively brought to life here. My ONLY gripe about Kong himself is that, in the early going the filmmakers tried to humanise him just that little but too much, and it kinda fell flat to me. Once things actually got moving and shaking, though, it all got a lot better.",8
"Who won? Legendary studios, & far from a minus one.","@somegeekguy-Wow, I'm just as surprised as you are reading this right now, believe me. My expectations were kind of meh, me personally, Godzilla Vs Kong (GVK) was OKAY, nothing special, maybe about a 6/10So who won this time in Godzilla X Kong & what is this New Empire?... well legendary studios of course!After a victorious achievement for Toho... we all know what we've come for here at legendary studios, & the results are definitely not a minus one...because this time we up the ante, and the people have spoken, we want this, legendary in this film is simply unlocking the massive cheese vault oozing into my optic stems, Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire is a hyper adrenaline rush energizer, it felt like my brain waves digested a high voltage energy drink kicking every inch of my brain cells.Dan Stevens is a solid comic relief along with Brian Tyree Henry. The jokes land a bit better this time around. The aura & creative decisions in this film have almost an 80's vintage vibrant feel, the music & color palette compliment each other perfectly along with cinematography.My issues? Well... why does the movie have Monarch being okay with bringing anybody down to hollow earth? Reliance on slight jumpy exposition, small things that could have been explored a little more to leave more an impact. It's not perfect for those, however I will argue this film was a lot closer to striking close to being perfect than you would think a film of this caliber could do.This is what happens when Cinematography, awareness, consistency & finding the footing on following Kaijus, gets the best of a cinematic experience, it's just as much a kaiju story as it is a human story & It's a Love Letter to the showa era & fans should be proud.I've never been more invested in the actual story of the kaijus until this movie, expositions & humans don't ruin it either this time. It's not anything special, but what is special are what we are here for, & that's the Kaijus.New Empire, by far, has the longest showtime for Kaiju action that I've ever seen in a monster flick. Beautifully shot cinematic camera scenes, there is one specific upside down shot unfolding to the right side up, just amazing cameraworkThe gradual building blocks embedded in the story left exciting awe in entertainment & care of handling Kaiju moments. The humans are just enhancers for the monsters. Compared to GVK, they have a better direction here without getting lost.It's a ride, took the issues of GVK & corrected it more, there's plenty of action if not more than you'd think... there's plenty of surprises, emotional character moments with humans/monsters, & although a not so perfect expositions still a solid fun plot/story following the elements at play... Godzilla X Kong was a lot better than I thought it was going to be & that's worth something.7.5 / 10.",6
A Hollow Earth For A Hollow Film,"Godzilla x Kong is undeniably vacuous and as hollow as the imaginary world it portrays. It's essentially a very forgettable monster mashup that aims for the heights of the epic and terrifying; but instead serves an OTT nonstop chest-beating slugfest, smothered in tawdry CGI. It's overpowered monster WWE seemingly presented as something the filmmakers *believe* or estimate an audience will like; as if it were the product of a soulless spreadsheet.These tired titans of bygone cinema have been pulled back into the limelight as the viewer suffers a nowhere-plot aimed at the lowest common denominator. The Kaiju terror is here, but in a very watered-down state.No dialogue because it's just senseless roaring beasts? Don't need to pay anyone to write a good script. Excessive closeups of the beasts all the time? Well that handily means they didn't need to animate higher-budget complex scenes from a more interesting POV. Sensory overload to distract the viewer from the complete lack of actual substance? Check. The corner-cutting is so apparent the more you look; the buck is passed onto the consumers who continue to accept this poor standard of filmmaking time and time again.4/10.",4
Pepto Bismal X Primal Thanos VS. Donkey Kong with a chain X Sub-Zero,"Wow, just wow. Now the thing is, the reason I am saying wow, is for a few big reasons that can probably relate to a lot of regular humans like me because I am most definitely human and not Godzilla trying to promote his own film. The reasons being; CGI, Big monster go rahh, and epic battle scenes. Anything else is boring and I frankly could care less about in this film because it affects nothing and all I care about are the things that THE FILM IS ACTUALLY ABOUT (humans).First, I wanna start off by saying that comparing this film's CGI to Godzilla Minus One (greatest Godzilla film that actually made me care about humans), budget wise, is like an insult. GMO had a budget near abouuuut 20 million or so, while GXK had 10x the budget. GMO managed to achieve winning an Oscar with 100x less visual art employees and having the best and probably the most realistic large scale CGI I've seen ever. BUT, the CGI even with such a smaller film beating it, is still excellent as always and doesn't look like some PS5 game that was reprogrammed to run on a Nintendo Switch, unlike other films. It has definitely been one of the consecutive aspects of the MonsterVerse.Monsters; I'm a sucker for Godzilla, not so much Kong, but this version of him definitely catches my eye. Godzilla and Shimo were what really brought this film together, and the funny thing is, before I saw Godzilla with pink atomic breath, it was my most disliked color, but on him, it's my preferred look for him. I also already loved cold related things so a big beast like Shimo definitely made me see this film.Battle Scenes. Now I know, I know, not all Godzilla films can entirely be epic fight scenes, I'M JUST SAYING, I wish they were longer. They are definitely what everyone, including me, came to see, and I am beyond glad with the outcome of the film, that I totally didn't see coming (that's sarcasm), and I actually would love to see more of the franchise, whatever it may be. Also to anyone who disliked the movement speed of Godzilla, watch literally any dated Godzilla film.In summary, I love Godzilla, Dune Part Two and GMO still beat it by an inconceivable number, but if you like big monsters or just Godzilla in General, watch this, maybe watch it again, or just watch the fight scene clips.",7
The Best Addition to the Monsterverse so far,"Let's be honest. I went in expecting this movie to be dumb, but pretty entertaining. Just an average blockbuster. Fortunately, this time it was so entertaining that you can ignore the dumb parts.And of course, it's not an ambitious movie, there's a lot of cliche, oversimplification etc., but I still expected worse. Most of the time humans are not acting like idiots, their crazy ideas are pretty convincing within this world and the whole cast does a great job keeping us entertained. Relations between our human characters work pretty well.There's a lot of worldbuilding here, successfull one in my opinion. Ancient civilization, prophecies, stories written on walls, some scores to even. The Hollow Earth looks great, you can see how this whole ecosystems works with its own rules.And finally, Titans. CGI is really good, fight scenes don't disappoint and, the most important thing, monsters act like they should act. There's startegy, there's a lot of preparing, but also there's hierarchy, decisions made out of fear and fights for territory. Writers managed to make the Titans seem humane while also staying within their animal nature. The outcome of that is convincing, at least for me.Some people might have a problem with the fact that most of this movie is basically assembilng the team for the final battle, but I think this time Monsterverse used a cliche in pretty much the best way possible.In the end, Godzilla x Kong is a satisfying and engaging blockbuster as well as great addition to the franchise. I wonder, how are they gonna beat that in the next one...",7
Fun and trash,"Look, nobody is watching these movies because they want water tight plots and engaging human stories. We're here because we want to see giant things smashing stuff up.Movies like this are like a Big Mac. It's not real food but it has its place.It is a whole load of silly, loud, goofy fun.The opening of this movie sees Kong luring a pack of giant hollow earth hyena things into a complex mechanical trap. He then takes a shower after covering himself in the blood of one of those giant hyena things having torn it in half whilst letting out a trademark intimidating roar.The first human moment sees Jia (the small girl from versus) having some psychic visions.It is that ridiculous.There was a ""surprise"" death that was possibly the most telegraphed in history and a scene where a monarch monitoring station, in hollow earth, has been destroyed. (Remember that hollow earth is huge, mostly uncharted and full of giant monsters) and the question is asked ""What could have done this?""
Giant mechanical arm ex machina. Loads of explanation for stuff we didn't ought to have figured out. Magic mind control. Magic gravity control.There's a kind of anti gravity fight which is pretty decent and scenes of our favourite titans on Rio beach, Giza and even having a nap in Rome's Colloseum.Honestly it's ridiculous. Ridiculous and very enjoyable.",6
When you want the human cast to die,"More than the enemy monsters. They really added nothing to the film. Except annoyance dumb rehashed mcu jokes, not even remotely amusing. Not even in the same league as the masterpiece like Godzilla minus 1. This will be my last one of these types of Godzilla movies they toss out tripe like this on a regular basis like EA churns out GaaS games that ultimately get shut down within a year. Why because they are poop. The Cranston one was good, then the Farminga one wasn't bad, though the milly brown family aspect made it cringe. Soon as we got to the ones with ms hall and skarsgard they went down the pan and in the gutter. All flashy bright colors felt like we were watching iron man. Such a shame because Godzilla Kong and the creatures really tried to carry the human cast. But every scene these collection of humans were in we wanted them to meet a grizzly end. Such a farcry from Godzilla Minus 1 directed by Takashi Yamazaki.",4
Great representation of Showa Era!,"In ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"" the epic showdown between these two legendary titans feels like a nostalgic throwback to the classic Showa Era of Godzilla films, where the focus was on thrilling monster battles. The film doesn't disappoint in this aspect, as the fight sequences are incredibly well-executed and visually stunning, capturing the raw power and scale of these colossal creatures.What sets this film apart is its ability to balance the spectacle of the monster battles with a decent plot that keeps the audience invested. While it may not break new ground in terms of storytelling, the plot serves its purpose by providing enough context and stakes to drive the action forward. It effectively sets the stage for the epic clash between the monsters, making their confrontation feel earned and impactful.One of the standout aspects of the film is its breathtaking visual effects. The CGI is top-notch, seamlessly blending the massive creatures into their environments and delivering jaw-dropping action sequences that truly immerse the audience in the epic battle between the Titans. From the destruction of cityscapes to the intricate details of the monsters themselves, the VFX work is nothing short of astonishing.After watching ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"" I'm left wanting more. The film delivers on its promise of entertainment, offering a thrilling cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impression. I'm already looking forward to revisiting the movie and eagerly anticipating future installments that continue to deliver the same level of excitement and spectacle. Overall, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is a must-watch for fans of monster movies and anyone looking for an exhilarating ride at the movies.",10
Godsilly,"Absolute nonsense, and anyone who didn't like Godzilla vs. Kong will probably hate this. I enjoyed myself the same way I'd enjoy eating two bags of potato chips in one sitting. I'm feeling a bit empty and confused at why I did such a thing now it's over, but it was tasty junk at the time.I feel like Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire has the least dialogue out of any giant monster movie of the last decade or so, maybe longer. It keeps the human characters at a minimum, which is a double-edged sword. They're not as frequently annoying, but when you have a small cast of humans, the sense of danger dissipates, because no one is the kind of character that could die at any point before the very end (and even then). But all the scenes with the giant apes, with no dialogue? Good stuff. The humans are there to just explain stuff that doesn't really need to be explained. I almost wish this had been a silent movie.There's some good schlock here. I laughed a lot. There's a lot of action, maybe too much. It ends very suddenly, the two titular monsters take a while to meet up, and though I liked the main villain, he takes too long to be introduced. The narrative here is a mess, and it only gets by through having so many different creatures, fights, and ridiculous sci-fi concepts.Still, it's not the kind of kaiju movie where people will complain that ""there weren't enough monsters."" I feel like Godzilla x Kong provides plenty of dumb entertainment, ridiculous spectacle, and action to the point where watching it was never dull for a minute. I had fun, but looking back on it now, it does feel like the cinematic equivalent of (a lot of) empty calories.",7
What is happening,Huuuge Godzilla fan since early 80s...my 15 year old also loves these movies ...this looks like the budget version of the last one ...like it's so bad we were laughing out loud in theater ...like it's bad ...real bad compared to any of the other monster verse movies ...but it's ....entertaining with some cool stuff It....they could of left out all human dialogue and it would of been at least a star better ...they both expect you so have watched and memorized all the other movies and somehow at the same time act like they other movies almost didn't exist ...i have a feeling this might be the end of the monster verse and maybe they have something else in mind ..because this was not cooked all the way.....on any level.,5
Monsters can tell a story w/o human dialogue,"Godzilla and Kong: A New Empire is exactly what you are going to get. A movie about Kaiju finding their way in the world with the established notion of coexisting with humans on this planet! Here, hollow earth is vastly explored with great visuals and Kong delivers an exceptional performance! The fight sequences are to the point and give great depth to the brutality of the situation on earth. As a kaiju fan I could not ask for anything more than to see monsters go at it and save the planet. Such as any other monster movie people go see. Godzilla is true to form and is his usual reign of terror to other kaiju. The human provide the skeleton of the story but the monsters carry it! I had so much fun with this movie! No need to go with the expectation of cinematic dialogue and epic depth.Just sit back, relax and watch monsters do their thing!",9
Stupid popcorn movie but a lot of fun,"Ok, so Citizen Kane it is not.If you like big CGI monsters hitting each other for two hours, then look no further.If you liked the previous two Godzilla Kong movies then you will probably like this. Just check your brain in at the door before you do.The acting is patchy, Dan Steven's steals every scene he is in, and the little kid is annoying after a while.I was more shocked and surprised by the amount of people that the monsters would have killed by trashing Rio and Cairo.But trying to look for logic in a movie like this is pointless. Just sit back and enjoy the madness and then forget about it immediately after.",6
The plot stinks worse than Kong poo.,"When asked what his plan is, a character in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire says 'throw everything at the wall and see what sticks'. Director Adam Wingard has adopted this approach when making this film, but on this occasion very little that is being randomly tossed about actually sticks. The smackdowns between the film's creatures are loud, frantic and reasonably fun, but the plot is a sloppy turd of Titan proportions -- a stinky, contrived, overblown mess brought to life in a maelstrom of not very convincing CGI.The script is absolutely terrible, and the majority of the film had me either scratching my head in confusion or laughing at its preposterousness. Kong being equipped with a metal fist is an undeniably cool idea, but the fact that the protagonists just happen to have such a device on hand in Hollow Earth is just crazy (especially one with built in anti-frostbite serum!). A vet who knows how to extract a Kong tooth also knows how to fly a Hollow Earth hover ship -- clearly a man of many talents. God only knows what the Iwi tribe were up to with their glowing pyramids. What was the deal with that glowing spike that nasty ape used to control the ice lizard? And why did everyone suddenly start floating around in Hollow Earth? (there might have been explanations for some of these points, but they became lost in all of the chaos).After Godzilla Minus One, I suggest leaving all future films featuring the big lizard to the Japanese.3.5/10, rounded down to 3 for Kaylee Hottle's perpetually anxious look -- doesn't the girl have any other expressions?",3
Truly mind damaging experience,"Something is very wrong with American film making for some time. Nothing makes sense here, intelligence of people is sharply underestimated (on the level of insult) and nothing really works with story. This last film about monsters shows that while it is trying to draw some long forgotten mythology that works worse than in most cartoons for children under 12. Human characters exist only to remind us of long forgotten cliches and definitely not of characters. Destroying the cultural and historical heritage of mankind is order of a day. And in all that there's nowhere in the site possibility of simple 'just sit back and enjoy the rid'. What an insulting mess of corporate idiocy... That beautiful queen under the surface and some fights do save this experience, but the whole thing is not worth the effort at all...",6
The MV Enters Its Late Showa Era,"PROS:
-This movie is a Saturday Morning Cartoon brought to life.-This is a 70's Showa Era Film with modern effects.-The Monsters are 100% the leads.-The Monster Brawls are absolutely nuts!-Godzilla vs. Kong Round 2 was fun.-The Entire 3rd Act is exactly what 5 year old would've loved.CONS:
-We are so far removed from the tone of 2014.-The pacing is all over the place.-The script was written with cocaine and mushrooms.-Every character is underdeveloped as is the plot.-There's no scale to any of the monster brawls.Like every iteration of Godzilla, it starts serious then slowly becomes a kid's franchise. Well, the Monsterverse is now officially a kid's franchise for better or worse. I say knowing full well that if I watched this as a kid it would've been the greatest movie ever. However, watching it as a 35 year old man, I can't ignore the flaws. This movie feels like a fever dream. There are some big crazy ideas here, but the movie doesn't hover over any of it. They throw so much at you so quickly that you have no time to absorb anything before the movie is moving on. The same goes for the characters, who exist to deliver exposition and that's it (a low-key waste of Rebecca Hall's talent). The Monsters are the opposite, they are the leads of the movie. This movie feels like Kong 3: The Hollow Earth War. There are long stretches where there's no dialogue and the story is being told through the expressions of the Monsters, and truthfully, it works. The Monster fights are meant to be seen on the big screen. Especially a battle that takes place in zero gravity. Seeing Godzilla and Kong properly team up is something my inner child needed to see. My theater cheered with joy as they charged into battle together. This is the kind of movie that the young fans will absolutely love and there's nothing wrong with that. I grew up on the Showa Era movies and that's exactly what this is. This is the kind of monster movie that creates the next generation of fans. With that in mind, this movie does its job. 6/10.",6
Felt like a Guardians movie....,"This is not your typical Monsterverse movie. My wife and I both agreed it was like watching a Guardians of the Galaxy movie. It was entertaining and the soundtrack will be pretty good. Anytime you put KISS into a soundtrack it will be good. I thought the monsters looked pretty good. The steroid Kong was pretty funny with his Thanos gauntlet. Kind of excited to see baby Kong going forward. Plus Godzilla's bed looks like my cat's bed. Funny to see him sleep where he does twice. Hopefully they can go back to a more Godzilla minus one type movie. If I had any advise to future viewers, see it during matinee times. Definitely not worth the full price.",7
I had low expectations and was disappointed,"I think I've been spoiled by the masterpiece that was Godzilla minus one. Going back to this ultra generic brainless 0 story nonsense is just disappointing. I don't expect a great story but the dialogue was so bad and the story so pointless I almost wanted the humans dead so I didn't have to listen to them. Several Uber generic rehashed MCU jokes that weren't even funny. I love Godzilla and the monster verse started off great with Brian Cranston and that first Godzilla film but since then it's just slowly gotten worse imo. Like I said, I knew this would be dumb and I went in with low expectations but left feeling almost insulted at how ridiculous and stupid it was. I hate to say it because I love the idea of Godzilla movies.",5
Not enough Godzilla but still a great popcorn movie,"You get what you paid for. Lots of CGI titans, going scene by scene, then culminating into a boffo end fight scene. I've read some write ups online stating ""there's too much CGI.."" The movie is centered around a fifty foot gorilla, a sixty foot lizard, and they are fighting other enormous titans in a world that does not exist. Great special effects, great action, and a it's paced well.Story? Don't fool yourself. The story is as thin as half of a single hair. You came for the fictional animals fighting. Not enough Godzilla. That was a shame. Go see this if you are a fan of dumb, popcorn films. Don't expect Othello.",9
Skar Tissue,"I was surprised about how uninteresting I found a large parts of what should be a big, dumb, fun Kaiju movie and certainly that wasn't what I felt about ""Godzilla vs. Kong"". In fairness it picked up towards the end though.A signal coming from somewhere within the Hollow Earth causes Godzilla to begin to strengthen himself for an upcoming battle. Within Hollow Earth, Kong unwitting reveals a deeper level, that was previously sealed off and within that level are other giant apes, ruled over by a tyrannical king Skar. Kong challenges Skar but is wounded in a losing effort. Desperate he heads to the surface to convince Godzilla to join him in the battle.That all sounds pretty exciting I know, but its all belaboured by a relatively boring middle section, that we spend with the human characters, exploring the Hollow Earth. The humans themselves are actually pretty good. Dan Stevens is great in everything and he's having a lot of fun here. He has good chemistry with lifelong friend Rebecca Hall and with Bryan Tyree Henry, both of whom are reprising their roles from ""Godzilla vs. Kong"". Still though their voyage through Hollow Earth is lacking in peril, or excitement. (Whilst we're here, the ""Monarch"" TV series established that time moves much slower in Hollow Earth than it does on the outside world - a fact that this film ignores entirely.)It does, as you might imagine, pick up for a zero gravity multi-Titan battle that takes place leading into the films climax. From that moment on I was engaged with the film and enjoyed it through to the ending.I don't know how helpful it is to compare this with ""Godzilla Minus One"" as despite sharing the same character, they have very different objectives in the stories they tell. But I did feel this was inferior to the last Monsterverse film and I'm not sure where I'd take the series from here.",6
Stay home and save your money,"The plot to Godzilla x Kong: New Empire is that below the Earth are face painted tribal people who use crystals to control gravity, and who are a looking for a psychic deaf girl because they need her to awaken a mother moth that shoots magical spider webs, in order to unite old man King Kong, his mini-me, and nuclear Godzilla, to stop a big red monkey with a bone bullwhip and an ice breathing lizard dog.It would have been better if this plot had been all monster and no humans, but like the rest of this universe its mostly humans who are dumb and unlikeable and stupid and in this one the humans are the most dumb and unlikeable and stupid than any of the previous films.All four prior films had some charm this one lacks. It's super dumb and not worth seeing in theaters. Just stay home and don't watch.",1
What a ride Strongest part in Monsterverse!,"I would not talk about this part of the Monsterverse, except that I remained fascinated by this sequel and the origin of the Hollow Earth. Kong is the character in this part exactly as he should be, a true leader who is ready to go to the end to save everyone he cares about. Is stopped, in the course of the film an inexplicable connection with Godzilla as well as with Mothra is born, which connects these two Alpha Titans in a unique way.Scar King is one of the strongest antagonists out of all the parts. Although the movie comes together, you haven't seen half of it, a merciless and terrible tyrant who stops at nothing for his throne! I won't say anything about Shimuo, one of the greatest A titans! This movie deserves everything recommendations and hopefully more parts in the future!",8
Loving The Monster Verse!,"The New Empire is the latest installment in the MonsterVerse, bringing together the iconic titans in an epic clash and uneasy alliance. The film's narrative dives into the discovery of a new threat emerging from the Hollow Earth, prompting Godzilla and Kong to team up once more to defend the surface world.The story unfolds with a fast-paced urgency as ancient secrets are unearthed and new monstrous adversaries rise. While the plot is undeniably engaging, it occasionally feels rushed, lacking the depth and development that could have elevated the film from great to exceptional. Some story arcs could have benefitted from more screen time to fully flesh out the intriguing mythology that surrounds these legendary creatures.Despite this, the cast delivers stellar performances across the board. Rebecca Hall returns alongside Brian Tyree Henry and Kaylee Hottle ensuring that the human element of the story remains strong amidst the colossal battles. Dan Stevens also makes an appearance as Trapper, a pretty fun and interesting character.The true stars, however, are the VFX and SFX teams. The visual effects are nothing short of spectacular, bringing the titans and their world to life with breathtaking detail and realism. The sound design amplifies every roar and explosion, immersing the audience in the heart-pounding action. The sheer scale and spectacle of the monster battles are awe-inspiring, making every clash a visual feast.Overall Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire earns a solid 7/10 from me. The film boasts a fantastic cast and phenomenal VFX and SFX, ensuring a thrilling cinematic experience. While the story could have benefitted from more nuanced development, the movie's strengths more than make up for its shortcomings. Fans of the MonsterVerse will undoubtedly appreciate this latest adventure, and it sets the stage for even more exciting possibilities in future installments.",7
Hectic gibberish,"I keep coming back to these movies. Over and over. I love monster movies and can enjoy dumb-fun action. I'm the exact target audience. How do they continue to fail? Aside from Godzilla (2014), they range from mediocre to terrible. And GxK is no different.I know most reviews will compare this to Godzilla Minus One. But I have to. Every single Godzilla shot from Minus One is better than every single shot of him in GxK. Every single action scene in Minus One is better than every single one in GxK. Better story, characters, dialogue, emotional investment. Everything. Minus One is better in every way.The worst thing I can say about GxK is... I was so bored. And I didn't care about anything that was happening. Zero investment. This is partly because it doesn't really have a story. Stuff just happens. Halfway through, I still didn't know what the story was about, what conflict we might be heading to, any kind of build up of a threat.They continue with another useless human plot, completely formulaic and bland. One of the only positives is a highly talented cast. They're just not given anything to work with. Rebecca Hall is the only one who gets to show her talent.Even worse is the 50+ comedic attempts. I laughed twice. The nearly sold out crowd laughed a few times. The rest made me cringe. They're like dad jokes. The entirety of the human story is basically a kids movie.What about the titans? They rarely show the scale of these monsters. Most of the time it's from the perspective of the monsters, not the humans. So they always look like they're 6 feet tall, with everything around just smaller.Even the movements are so fast like humans are fighting. When they fall, they fall in a second. No ground-shaking impact. It feels so fake and nowhere close to epic. I'm not anti-CGI, but the big action scenes are hectic gibberish.I give up. It shouldn't be this difficult. I don't even need it to be a ""good"" movie. Just entertaining with good action. Instead I get forgettable and dumb.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 3/28/2024)",3
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire review,"I like Godzilla in general but I vastly prefer Toho's output over Legendary's franchise. I thought the first 4 was mediocre and this was no different quality wise from it's predecessors.This film followed the footsteps of GvK and KOTM by trying to fix the problem of the previous installment but mess up on something else. The fight scenes in GvK were very dragged out so they tried to make it shorter, however any action sequence with Godzilla was just bland. Speaking of which, Godzilla legitimately felt like a regular old side character rather than a main character. Not to mention how he moves. I'm not kidding when I say Godzilla moves like he was crack. His movements were just so weird and unnatural. This was disappointing to me because I came here just because of Godzilla and seeing him get sidelined was just crushing.I can tell they tried to make this a great film. Because in the first act, they put in a bunch of separate action sequences in between scenes trying to entertain the audience but as I said, they were completely 1-sided extremely short fights that really doesn't entertain us. However the writers did come up with smart choices throughout the film and set up some of the twists well but the plot was so underwhelming. 2014 was the only MV film with a decent plot and it just went downhill from there. Don't even get me started with how they ended the film. ""You are my home"" like what does that mean? I know what the girl is trying to say but couldn't they figure out a better line?Speaking of which, this film has a lot of points that makes no sense from a logical perspective. Where does the hollow earth get light? How did the tribe end up down there without any advanced technology? How do they survive the high temperatures of inner parts of Earth? And the list goes on.However they did nail at one thing. Kong's plot and his action scenes were legit very fun and entertaining albeit I felt like they didn't know how to start the opening so it was just Kong chilling. Obviously I came to theaters to see Godzilla not Kong but I don't have much to complain about Kong. The team did think of creative ideas to get the fights going and so on. Even if it wasn't the best, The human plot was a significant improvement over previous installments and the final battle was entertainingRating: 6.3/10.",6
Monsterverse fans will rejoice,"A roaring, reverberating monster filled Fiasco. A gorgeous spectacle in the truest sense. A visual extravaganza made for the biggest screen possible.It's no less than a treat for the theater-loving audience.Yes, human characters leave a negligible impact. The punchlines miss their mark most of the time, but who really cares? It's a pleasure for your eyes and soul.If you're a ""Monsterverse"" fan like me and wished for more Titan action, trust me, you are going to get out of the theatre with a big smile on your face, your heart will be fulfilled.Your inner child will be satisfied.Don't miss it.",7
"More Kong, Less Godzilla","Godzilla and Kong would've made a great team, but not a lot to convince that they would be honestly. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is an okay movie, but probably the weakest of the MonsterVerse movies so far. The movie would mostly rely onto the story of Kong that it has forgot to give a plot for Godzilla. The most we would see from Godzilla is that he travels and that's it, with not much new from him. That and just like in the other MonsterVerse movies, I really did not care for the human characters. I felt they haven't gotten a lot of character suitable for this movie. The only ones I see does try to put effort to the movie's purpose is Jia. However, it can be well enough to be an exciting monster film with awesome battle scenes that feature abilities for each monster that they have, along with great atmosphere for Hollow Earth. I'd say that it can be a good movie for Godzilla fans for the monster fights. But if you're expecting this to be something like Godzilla Minus One, I wouldn't set your expectations that high. It was not that bad as it is for a monster movie, but could've done a lot more.",6
A king-sized disappointment,"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire throws humanity's favourite giant monster brawl back into the ring, but this titanic tussle feels more like a tired rehash than a worthy successor. We open with the uneasy alliance between Godzilla and Kong, tasked with protecting humanity from lurking threats. However, whispers of a hidden danger soon tear this fragile peace apart, dragging our ape and atomic lizard into a clash for survival.The film's biggest strength lies in its breathtaking visuals. The battles between Godzilla and Kong are undeniably impressive. Director Adam Wingard stages these showdowns with a chaotic energy, taking us from the neon-drenched streets of Hong Kong to the gravity-defying caverns of Hollow Earth. The special effects are top-notch, with both titans rendered in stunning detail. Godzilla's atomic blasts illuminate the screen, while Kong swings through the air with a balletic grace that belies his immense size.Unfortunately, the impressive visuals can't mask the film's narrative shortcomings. The plot feels cobbled together, relying on tired tropes and predictable twists. The human characters, once again relegated to monster movie peanut gallery duty, are given little to work with. There's a valiant effort to establish a connection between Kong and a newfound ape companion in Hollow Earth, but it's underdeveloped and ultimately inconsequential. Meanwhile, bland dialogue and clichéd motivations make it hard to care about their fate.The pacing is another culprit. The film lurches between slow, exposition-heavy stretches and frenetic action sequences. The editing feels choppy at times, leaving some fight choreography confusing and hard to follow. The score by Tom Holkenborg (Junkie XL) is a mixed bag. While it boasts some pulse-pounding tracks during the fights, it lacks the thematic depth or memorable motifs that truly elevate a monster movie.Godzilla x Kong: The New Kong Empire feels like a missed opportunity. It evokes memories of classic monster brawls but fails to capture the spirit of what made them special. While Kaiju fans might find some enjoyment in the big-budget slugfests, the film ultimately disappoints with its forgettable story, underdeveloped characters, and uneven execution. If you're looking for a monster movie masterpiece, look elsewhere. This one's best left on Skull Island.",5
"It's an epic showdown, packed with great entertainment","""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire""It's a smashing good time, offering solid entertainment that meets the standards of what a monster flick should be. There's nothing particularly fresh or new here, just the familiar sights we've seen before. The plot and characters are cookie-cutter, but there's a decent amount of fun mixed in. The film tries to wreak havoc on multiple countries, reminiscent of Michael Bay's style, turning it into a global crisis scenario, but it doesn't quite hit those heights. Still, it's not as bad as feared, and ultimately, it's just plain fun to watch.It's a good movie for family time!",8
Eye candy and not much more than that...,"When you open a review by saying it looks good, it's never a good sign, is it? Well, Godzilla X Kong The New Empire looks good...And that's about it, really. The 'story' is basically the same old nonsense that Hollywood has been propping their kaiju movies up with since forever, people do things for inexplicable reasons, the monsters - a fair number of them this time out - go bang crash, lots of buildings fall down with presumably thousands of innocent people dying in the process and eventually everybody goes back to living their lives as if nothing untoward had happened. Just another day at the office...Oh, one plus is that we get to see the wonderful Mothra, that's always a good thing. Sadly, we are alwaso introduced to 'baby' Kong. Yes, that's every bit as bad as it sounds...Hollywood's first Godzilla movie to follow last year's magnificent Godzilla Minus One was never gonna be easy.....but it should have been easier and better than this.",6
A Beautiful Piece of Garbage,"The recent American Godzilla films have not exactly been narrative driven think-pieces, but rather monster-on-monster brawlers. If you want monster action, The New Empire has it in spades, and is easily the most beautiful of the four recent films. The Titans, every one of them, looks eye-wateringly outstanding, an absolute stand-out being Mothra, who remains as gorgeous as she was in King of the Monsters.Godzilla looks great, and his new colour palette is especially amazing, and though he gets top billing in the title, he is side-lined in his own film, in favour of Kong. Don't get me wrong, Kong is a good draw in this film, in his pursuit to hopefully find other giant apes in the Hollow Earth, a realm which is as epic as the monsters that reside there; it just would have been good to see more of our favourite lizard too.Though the effects will absolutely be the number one reason to see this film, the story, script and human characters are certainly not. The script is the most contrived, convenient mess this addition to the franchise has ever seen. Example, 'we need special item - lucky, it is right next to us, though we never mentioned it before until now because...reasons.'A massive thing missing from this monster movie is a heart. The first two films had Ken Watanabe's Serizawa, a sole believer in Godzilla and the titans, who fought for co-existence between monsters and humanity. The third entry had Millie Bobby Brown's Madison, who exhibited an undying faith in Godzilla when others did not. This film? Yeah, none of that.Rebecca Hall does her best as Dr. Andrews, and despite the occasional moment where she can flex her acting muscles (let's face it, she deserves better than this), she is normally used as an exposition tool, simply telling us the back-story and describing what will happen next. Think of the film this way - there is a big monster scene, then Dr. Andrews will explain why and what happens next - then there will be another monster scene - rinse and repeat.Bryan Henry and Dan Stevens share the role of comedic relief, though it is Ron Smyck as Harris who arguably had some of the best lines (and deserved more screen time). The film at times often feels like a comedy, more than an action feature, trying to squeeze in as many 'funny' lines as a Marvel film.The music is of course as on point as ever - a bombastic score that makes every set-piece that much more entertaining, but that's all this film has - it is the most beautiful and colourful the monsterverse has ever been - but it is shallower than any puddle you'll find.",5
Why Compare This to Minus One? They're Different Films.,"Comparing this film to ""Minus One"" seems odd because they're completely different. This movie is filled with action and takes clear inspiration from the Showa era Godzilla films. On the other hand, ""Minus One"" is more serious in tone, while this one is, to put it mildly, a bit goofy. If you expect the same level of seriousness from both films, you'll likely be let down by this one. However, if you go into it expecting a silly, fun movie, that's exactly what you'll get. There's non-stop monster action throughout the film, with barely a 10-minute break from seeing monsters on the big screen. Ultimately, understanding and embracing the unique qualities of each film is key to enjoying them to the fullest.",10
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire - A Disappointing Clash of Titans,"The last film of the series, which first deals with two great legendary creatures one by one and then brings them together in a single film; Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire was released. If you are interested in the creature concept and especially mega creature fights, you may think this movie is for you. You may want to watch the monsters that you were afraid of when you saw them on television when you were little, to experience the same feeling when you grow up, or you may want to take your children to the movie of the toys that they are most likely to buy on hamburger menus and show them this movie as the Transformers of the period. In any case, you would be wrong . We will explain how it happened in the next part of the article, with comments containing even a little spoiler.Let's go in order. First of all, we have an action movie in front of us. This movie does not contain horror elements like the Godzilla and King Kong films of the horror genre of the fifties, nor like 2005's King Kong with Jack Black or 2023's Japan-released Godzilla. It's not that the movie fails to be scary, it's that it doesn't even consider being scary. Godzilla and Kong, who are referred to as Titans instead of creatures, monsters, etc. In the movie, exist as mythological heroes throughout the movie.Contrary to horror, the film gives the impression that it is designed as an action movie that can be watched by the whole family. It contains very wild images for the young audience, especially with scenes of Kong hunting in his natural life and especially dismembering his prey. Although the green mucous fluid effect was used instead of blood in the scenes where Kong divides the giant jackals or the sea monster in half in order to reduce the apparent brutality, this eliminates the possibility of calling the film a children's movie.In a way, the movie follows the same formula as Transformers . Creatures from space or underground emerge, and some of them want to take over the Earth, while others fight against them on behalf of humanity. Here, Kong in particular seems like the good Autobots that it's probably easier to attribute human characteristics to a mammalian ape than to a cold-blooded lizard. The difference between Godzilla x Kong and Transformers is that everything from character structure to jokes is presented to the audience in a more filtered and simplified way. This situation, which causes too much simplification, leads to moments in the film that cannot be explained to anyone, such as the Bernie character being allowed to join the journey to the Hollow World.While there is an explanation in the story for the primary school-age character Jia's obligation to return to the Hollow Earth, there is no explanation for a civilian like Bernie endangering his life just because he wants to. Likewise, for Kong, who is expected to fight against the greatest danger ever on Earth, while putting on that mecha glove, which was previously shown in the poster and in every promotional material, on the hand of Kong, whose hand has ice burns; There is no answer to the question of why the rest of the mecha armor in question was not used. The audience is expected to say, ""Only one glove was made, and it probably fell on Kong's injured hand."" Although we will not list all of the open doors one by one here, there are plenty of examples similar to these two in the movie.The inconsistency is noticeable not only in the story but also in the visual language. Although very successful visual effects were used in the previous movie of the series, Godzilla vs. Kong , which was also shot by the same director , this movie is where almost everything except people is CGI; It contains visuals like an Atari game plugged into a tube television. The visual effects of the entire Hollow World are not pleasing to the eye, except for Godzilla, Kong, and Kong's other baby monkey, who look serious even though they lack fine detail. Especially the other dinosaur, which is capable of starting an ice age, appears with an animation quality that can only be seen in B movies shot by small film studios with the help of friends. Indeed, the film has a high ranking among the films released in 2024, but remains relatively small due to the brand it deals with and its goal of becoming a blockbuster; It has a budget of 125-130 million dollars. The visual problems do not end with the fact that the creatures look like poorly animated Pokemon: Like the creatures that come out of the Pokemon ball and pose, the creatures in this movie constantly need to get to high places and pose, but the sloppy editing and camera angles result in the axis being distorted.The film, whose action scenes and climax points are obviously rushed, instead of long action sequences; It looks like a collection of scenes taken from different movies, with short and excessive action scenes. In other words, it seems like the aim is to short videos to be shared on YouTube or social media instead of the integrity of the movie. The film, which resembles many works such as Avatar , Journey to the Center of the Earth , and God of War in many respects, cannot fully integrate what it takes from these works into its own visual world. The use of visual effects, which is the biggest expectation from this movie, fails to please the audience and send them home.It feels like Adam Wingard, who attracted attention with a horror movie like You're Next or the previous movie of this series, Godzilla vs Kong, did not have the opportunity to put what was on his mind on the screen this time. It seems that the series will continue after the Godzilla x Kong movie, which will be more enjoyable if you lower your expectations and go to the cinema to have an event. All we have to do is wait for the last movie of Planet of the Apes, which will be released a month from now .",6
Disappointing,"I've watched some trash in my time, but this is amongst the worst. Compared to the excellent Godzilla Minus One this really is an insult to anyones intelligence. I wasn't expecting much, CGI fighting CGI was the premise and that's what I was expecting but even that was plodding and boring. The bits in-between with the humans was just terrible. Terrible acting, terrible exposition, I just had enough of it by about half way through. The most the critics could say about this film was that it was ""fun"", but I didn't find much fun in it. The jokes didn't land and the CGI didn't have any of the excitement or impact I expected.",1
As if the last installment wasn't silly enough...,"This installment was fairly boring for much of the running time. The acting was wooden and when the actors suddenly feel the need to extrapolate to show why what just happened was significant, then you know you have mediocre talent writing your storyline. And some of those aspects of the Monsterverse had gotten downright silly recently. All of them involving Kong. Last movie, he got a Monkey Axe. This one, he gets a metal armored upgrade for an arm he couldn't use, from a Monarch employee who just happened to have some unused monkey tech lying around. How convenient. None of which address the fact Kong's arm was now frostbitten and basically useless before. Not any more. He's fine. Now he packs a dandy punch. Ah well. The movie is about kaiju, so I suppose expecting reality to make an appearance is expecting too much. But sooooo much extrapolation. Many, many examples abound. Hard to list them here without giving too much away. Basically my review comes down to this.... the last 45 minutes or so is pretty good, and action packed. Before that, well, it's tedious at best and poorly written. It's pretty eye candy, but you'll owe your brain an apology afterwards.",6
An Epic Spectacle of a Film with Basically No Story,"Adam Wingard's sequel to Godzilla vs Kong is filled to the brim with nonstop action and adventure. The film focuses primarily on Kong, as Godzilla takes a back seat until the end of the movie. The main narrative is that a team led by Rebecca Hall and Dan Stevens embark on a journey to the ""Hollow Earth"" to decipher a mysterious signal. Meanwhile, Kong is on a journey to find more of his kind. The cast does well, despite playing somewhat generic characters. It is, however, very clear that the filmmakers' principal focus is the spectacle, and the story is just a vehicle for the epic fight scenes. The fight scenes are indeed epic, however, as the monstrous titans engage in multiple colossal battles throughout the film. I think the film may have tried to balance too many ideas, though, including the emotional story involving Rebecca Hall's character and her daughter. There was just not enough buildup of the human storyline to make the conclusion rewarding. All in all, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is a fun popcorn movie, delivering spectacular action, and nothing more.",6
Krazy Kaiju Extravaganza!,"Let me get one thing out of the way... Pink is the highest energy wavelength, meaning Godzilla was at his most powerful in that scene with Kong.Now for the review... ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" took great liberties to tell a story that felt like a typical take on what this captivating franchise is known for.If you believed, at any point, that something looked non-credible or felt silly, then you haven't seen some of the classic-era movies featuring Godzilla.This mutated radioactive lizard has had his good, bad, and crazy days in movie-land, so watching him pull a few weird moves in ""Godzilla x Kong"" didn't come across as altogether strange.Much the same could be said of Kong who was essentially a smart kaiju-gorilla who managed to survive in conditions that no human ever could. With all we know so far about his journey, Kong has a bizarrely balanced intellect. Just short of speaking, he seems capable of higher thought, something I saw a lot of in this movie as well.Not only did ""New Empire"" live up to its name, it captured iconic kaiju-grade team-ups between Godzilla and Kong. And it didn't stop there! Even Mothra came on the scene and delivered some goosebumpy thrills.A prophecy connecting Skull Island manifested through Jia, the last of the tribe that once lived there. She reawakened kaiju-Mothra who was key to helping Kong and Godzilla realize their joint-guardianship potential.The Sci-Fi plot next saw Godzilla and Kong teaming up to take on a ruthless foe, the ape-chief known as the Scar King. He was part of Kong's species but not as keen on co-existence. The back-stories were engaging in this regard.Some hitherto unknown secrets cropped up in the story. There were some intriguing connections that linked the Scar King, Godzilla, and Kong in ways that were primal and memorable.They also went a step beyond Hollow Earth and showcased a previously uncharted sub-subterranean realm. The Iwi Tribe (an unknown prehistoric human civilization) soon became another thrilling addon to the script, not to forget other apes similar to Kong - who, up to this point, was the last of his kind.Monarch too played a vital role in the movie, one that made me see them in a new light. They continued to monitor all things anomalous, especially in regard to keeping Kong and Godzilla's paths from crossing. Then there was that outstanding freeze-powered Shimo titan!Territorial battles were still in focus, implying how the kaijus in question were more attuned to their animal instincts than anything genuinely evolutionary.I loved all the creature designs in the movie. They deserve their own bestiary - book merch recommendation. Speaking of books, John Scalzi's 2022 novel ""The Kaiju Preservation Society"" contained so many unforgettable moments, similarities to which I enjoyed watching in ""Godzilla x Kong"".The movie retained the idea of using Kong to go up against various monsters that threatened human existence. This was not new in ""The New Empire"", but a trope that has been covered before in the franchise.Like I stated before, this monster-verse took plenty of liberties to create a pop-culture mashup for the fans. They also catered to the conspiracy nerds in the crowd when they explored a variety of Hollow Earth sequences.In a lot of ways, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" was both an extinction warning and an origin story. Ironically, it took two giant monsters that could've ended us all and made them save us instead.Plenty of other noteworthy moments, glazed with extraordinary CGI and garnished with generous action sequences, made ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" a triumph in Fantasy-SciFi entertainment.Nobody in their right minds can call this a strictly credible plotline, but credibility is not why we root for a giant radioactive reptile that once had a fondness for destroying half of Tokyo but has since taken his travel plans global.As for Kong, even he'd have been surprised if someone told him he'd finally leave that dang island and go see the world - only to end up inside it.""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" was an anthropomorphized crossover-style extravaganza that captured numerous nuanced bits and bobs that have rendered its iconic kaijus famous among fandoms all over the world.In this monster-verse, they took a super-intense duo and let them indulge in a super-insane duet, with other dancers contributing their own jigs in a show that was literally too big for Broadway.--- --- ---
Noteworthy performances and contributions by the humans: Rebecca Hall (as Ilene Andrews), Ron Smyck (as Harris), Rachel House (as Hampton), Kaylee Hottle (as Jia), Brian Tyree Henry (as Bernie Hayes; timely hilarity), and Dan Stevens (as Trapper; weird heroics).",7
Tale of two plotlines,"There are two plotlines that interject at certain points. The ""kong tribe"" plotline and the ""chosen one"" plotline. The chosen one plotline is some of the cringiest boring nonsense imaginable while the Kong tribe plotline is actually servicable.Kong looks cool and the CG battles and fighting look pretty damn good, but as soon as the battle scenes end and Kong is replaced by the humans it all falls apart.""Im a bad mom"" boohoo this is the main focus of the human plotline. It is insufferable. And also the little girl is the best and she is actually the chosen one wow incredible. The girl is the key to everything.Also it never ceases to be comical to see a fight scene in a massive city inhabited by millions of people when you know that every building destroyed results in the thousands of deaths. And instead of it being a horror movie it is a ""fun"" family action film. It just makes me look around wondering if everyone is watching the same movie as I am this is like 9/11 times 50. The greatest national tragedy in brazilian history. But instead everyone cheers? Okay thenThere is maybe 20 minutes of entertaining stuff here all of it includes Kong, but even those parts are mediocre. This is the kind of slop netflix buys from India and throws them on the Netflix kids. But instead they made it into a full on movie? Christ almighty, Even the later transformers movies were leagues better than this. Absolute stinker of a movie.",3
Prepare to be blown away...,"I sat down to watch the 2024 movie ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"", and I was actually just expecting to be another run-of-the-mill recent times monster bash movie, as the newer movies with Godzilla and King Kong has proved to be. Now, don't get me wrong, because I have thoroughly and genuinely enjoyed the recent movies, by all means, but they were not really outstanding.And then director Adam Wingard brought ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" to the table. Holy Monster Bash, Batman, what a phenomenal surprise of a movie this turned out to be. I have to say that I was blown away by this movie, and I had not seen a movie of this magnitude making its appearance. I was fully and wholly entertained throughout the course of the 115 minutes that the movie ran for.The storyline in ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"", as written by Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett, Jeremy Slater and Adam Wingard, is pretty straightforward. But what works here, in comparison to the many previous newer Godzilla and/or King Kong movies, was that this movie was all amount Titans fighting one another, and the human storylines were mere backdrops. That worked so well for me, because the insane amount of action in terms of Titans fighting throughout the course of the movie, was amazing. And it made the movie work on such a great level for me. Seeing Godzilla and King Kong fighting, or either of them fighting other Titans, now that is why I sit down to watch movies such as this. And, oh boy, did director Adam Wingard deliver her.The acting performances in the movie are good, and I have to say that I wasn't really overly familiar with any of the actors or actresses on the cast list. Sure, I've seen some of them before, but am not all that familiar with their previous work. Kaylee Hottle (playing Kia) and Fala Chen (playing the Iwi Queen) definitely put on memorable performances with their characters.Something that is important for a monster bash movie such as ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" are special effects. And wow. I was beyond amazed here. The CGI in the movie is phenomenal, and it looks so great and realistic. And the sheer amount of mayhed and destruction throughout the course of the movie almost had me cheering in the cinema. This is definitely the most intense Kaiju movie (or Titans as they are called in this movie) I have ever seen. And that alone makes it more than well-worth sitting down to watch ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"".""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is how Kaiju (or Titan) movies are supposed to be. And this particular movie from director Adam Wingard was simply amazing. This is a movie that I strongly and warmly recommend you to go watch. Do it in the cinema, because the sounds of the Titans roaring and battling is so well-worth getting shook through from the cinema speakers. I loved that about the movie as well.I am a fan of this movie, no doubt about it. And when I walked out of the cinema, it was with a big 'wow, are you kidding me' feel. Because Adam Wingard's 2024 movie ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" was over-the-top and exactly how such a movie should be.My rating of ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" lands on a rock-solid nine out of ten stars.",9
Worst casting ever,"A filmmaker could have demonstrated better judgment in selecting the cast. The CGI is top notch. Still it remains perplexing who authorized the casting decisions, particularly the expressionless demeanor of the team, including the child artist whose acting falls short. However, a positive aspect is that her performance may inspire confidence in aspiring actors , if she can make it to hollywood then believe me anyone can. The screen time allotted to the actors was limited, leaving room for improvement. A more adept short film crew could have potentially achieved better results.Kudos to the CGI team; every moment is enjoyable except for the live-action performances.Note : 6 star just for the CGI.",6
downgrade of godzilla vs kong,"Previews movies are better there are no twist and turns just
simple story it fully based upon 4 main characters elevation eventhough it should be worked but it didn't there is no epic ending in which godzilla vs kong had for epic ending there should be twists and turning points like mechagodzilla came and beaten godzilla and kong but in this film there is no like that balance it's just 4 titans are fighting and suddenly ended it doesnot satisfies it.doesnot make you bore you can have fun time but it is a small movie with 1:55 minutes we need more runtime while going to theatres then only it staisfies with money we paid for ticket.",5
Amazing Monster Fight Movie,"I'm not going to Spoil the movie here because is something that you need to see in the Big Screen, whit your family and friends but man this movie has a lot Monster fight and action that you will not be disappointed, Godzilla and Kong are totally badass in this movie, in this one I love that Jia return she is the best human character in this movie just like in the Godzilla vs Kong. The movie kept me entertained all the time through the whole movie, and the visuals and design are amazing in this movie, and something I'm going to say there are a lot lore in the Hollow Earth that has to be explored
10/10 Amazing ⭐",10
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire - Spectacular Battles Amidst Narrative Shortcomings,"""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"" directed by Adam Wingard, continues the MonsterVerse saga with mixed results. The film, while visually stunning and action-packed, struggles with its narrative and character development. The returning cast includes Rebecca Hall as Dr. Ilene Andrews and Brian Tyree Henry as podcaster Bernie Hayes, joined by newcomer Dan Stevens, who plays a charismatic kaiju veterinarian.Stevens' portrayal of Trapper, a titan doctor, adds a humorous and laid-back vibe to the film. His character, however, feels underdeveloped and underutilized. Despite this, Stevens' chemistry with Hall provides some of the film's more enjoyable human moments.The film's visual effects are its standout feature, particularly the sequences involving Kong's journey in Hollow Earth and his interactions with a younger ape named Suko. These scenes showcase Weta's impressive CGI work and add emotional depth to Kong's character. However, Godzilla often takes a backseat, primarily appearing during chaotic destruction scenes until the climactic battle.The introduction of Skar King as the new antagonist arrives too late in the narrative, which diminishes the potential for a more developed conflict between him and Kong. Despite the delayed setup, the final showdown delivers on the franchise's promise of epic, crowd-pleasing monster battles. The climactic fight between Godzilla, Kong, and Skar King is thrilling, featuring stunning visuals and high-energy action that fans will appreciate.Overall, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" excels in delivering spectacular monster battles and impressive visual effects. However, it falls short in narrative cohesion and character development, making it a visually entertaining but somewhat shallow addition to the MonsterVerse.",7
Mixed bag and too much CGI,"Cinematography: the cinematography in the film was a standout; it utilized different types of lenses (e.g., wide angle) and different camera focuses with some blur in the background. It was innovative on one hand, but not over the top. The close-ups and medium shots were great.Editing and Pacing: Editing was commendable. Sometimes the pacing keeps me engaged, but then the narrative structure does not always keep up, with plot twists and character arcs that feel aimless or underdeveloped at times.Sound and Music: Sound and music play pivotal roles in setting the tone, with the electronic score punctuating the epic battles and quiet moments alike. However, the choice to abruptly cut music in some of the scenes detracts from the cohesion of the film's soundscape, leaving a disjointed impression that the rest of the soundtrack struggles to mend. In the second act, the soundtrack was very generic. It sounded similarly to what you can hear in typical superhero films with a ""heroic"" vibe. The whole second and third acts felt like a generic viewing experience.VFX: Visual effects are where the film shines brightest, crafting a world that is at once familiar and fantastically alien. The VFX was innovative and pushed the boundaries of the genre.CGI: The reliance on CGI is super heavy. On one hand, some CGI moments were great, but on the other hand, as the movie progressed, it became so much that I didn't want to watch it anymore because it looked generic. It feels like I am watching an animation film. Using too much CGI instead of real locations can sometimes break the immersive experience; the use of more authentic natural landscapes could benefit the film.Cast: The cast was incompetent. It often felt misplaced or unable to fully embody the larger-than-life characters they portray, which exacerbates this. In other words, it felt like I was watching actors from a 2012 parody movie.Costume Design: The character's costume design was terrible. They could have created unique costume designs for the characters, such as having the same for everyone while traveling.The movie's emotional and intellectual engagement was inconsistent. Mysticism and technology are both big ideas in the movie, but the story is both big, undeveloped, and hard to follow. I wish this film had more depth, meaningfulness and clarity. Also, Godzilla had less screen time, which is sad.In conclusion, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is a mixed bag. There is too much going on, and every detail (e.g., large, small or microscopic) is difficult to digest through visual storytelling. Individuals seeking a narrative with depth and coherence, not just smashing things, might feel it falls short in that aspect. Although the film has flaws, it showcases the progress in VFX.",5
A Decent Thrill But What Happened to Gravitational Time Dilation,"The latest installment in the MonsterVerse, ""Godzilla x Kong,"" delivers on its promise of spectacular kaiju battles and jaw-dropping visual effects. The titanic clash between the two iconic monsters is undeniably entertaining, providing fans with the epic showdown they've been eagerly anticipating. However, despite its strengths, the film leaves some crucial questions unanswered, particularly regarding the concept of aging in the Hollow Earth as touched upon in the Monarch TV Season.Firstly, the movie excels in its action sequences. The battles between Godzilla and Kong are choreographed with precision, showcasing the immense power and unique abilities of each titan. The special effects are top-notch, bringing these legendary creatures to life in a way that is both awe-inspiring and terrifying. The sound design complements the visuals perfectly, making each roar and clash resonate with the audience.The human characters, often a weak point in kaiju films, are serviceable here. While their storylines can feel secondary to the monster action, the cast does a commendable job of keeping viewers engaged. The exploration of the Hollow Earth is particularly intriguing, offering a glimpse into a mysterious and vibrant world that adds depth to the MonsterVerse lore.However, the film stumbles when it comes to integrating the broader mythology established in the Monarch TV Season. One glaring issue is the concept of aging in the Hollow Earth. The TV series hinted at the unique temporal properties of this subterranean realm, suggesting that time might function differently there. This intriguing idea had the potential to add a fascinating layer to the story, but ""Godzilla x Kong"" fails to address it adequately.As the characters delve deeper into the Hollow Earth, one can't help but wonder: how does aging work in this environment? Are the creatures and ecosystems affected by time in the same way as those on the surface? The movie provides no clear answers, leaving fans of the franchise with lingering questions. This oversight feels like a missed opportunity to enrich the narrative and explore the implications of such a unique setting.In conclusion, ""Godzilla x Kong"" is a solid entry in the MonsterVerse that delivers where it counts: in the epic, monstrous mayhem. The visual spectacle and the sheer scale of the battles make it worth watching for fans of the genre. However, its failure to address the intriguing concept of aging in the Hollow Earth, as introduced in the Monarch TV Season, and its occasionally uneven pacing prevent it from reaching its full potential. With a bit more attention to detail and storytelling cohesion, this movie could have been a true titan of its genre.",6
Good entertainment. Special effects oriented movie.,"I've had a good fun during this movie. It's important to recognise that Godzilla x Kong is purely entertainment and special effects focused. At times, there are too many 'effects' and action-packed moments that movie is dragging us into - at the cost of some more interesting aspects, such as for example a bit more constructive interactions between the main characters, learning their stories, motive etc.There isn't time for that really, because this movie doesn't slow down and the time ends up passing rather fast.That's why you should not expect too demanding plot. It doesn't have too much depth, yet it manages to remain sensible enough to make a decent storyline that can be followed. I've totally enjoyed getting immersed in getting to know the worlds created in this movie.",6
""" Blockbuster Fun - Godzilla X Kong ""","~ I did not have any expectations whatsoever before watching the film , after the trailers dropped I was kind of disappointed , but it was one hell of a ride in the theatres. Really enjoyed it. It is fun , action - packed , it has comedy , two or more gigantic monsters fighting on the big screen and it was damn fun. Kong is the main focus of the story and it does make sense because he is a character that can connect with people. The human characters are actually likable in this one especially Brian Tyree Henry as Bernie and Dan Stevens as Trapper. Rebecca Hall's character Dr. Irene Andrews is good aswell. But the main thing I loved about the film was it's epic climax. It was great. Overall the film is fun and entertaining that's all.",7
"Lots of monster action and a good setting, but doesn't really shine.","Pretty much what was expected with lots of Kaiju action and big, destructive fight scenes. The three plotlines each have their merits and tie together nicely, but it did slow the pace in the middle and the big showdown at the end felt a bit anticlimactic. Most of it was a bit silly, but it was entertaining and fun with good special effects, plenty of action and ample light-hearted moments. The human characters were annoying but bearable but the spectacle of the setting and human side of Kong made up for it. It's a great world they've created with Monarch and Hollow Earth, but there is only so much you can get out of the overall premise.",5
This movie has a HEART!!!!! LONG LIVE THE MONSTERVERSE,"I awaited for this movie for such a long time and oh boy, i was more than astonished!!! This movie is an emotional roller coaster, blending extremely exciting action with touching bonds and epic team ups.Suko, Kong's loyal companion who is like a son to him, steals a spotlight for me, he is so cute and shows his loyalty and affection towards Kong. Godzilla's and Kong's eventual team up is what we all wanted for so many years!!! For these two iconic titans to fight together against Skar King and one other formidable foe.The introduction of the main antagonist of the movie, Skar King is very interesting, I really like the concept of this antagonist as he will bring some emotions to the character as well which is very interesting for a titan to have such human like behavior, and also adds a whole new layer of excitement to the movie with later putting one of the best monster battles ever brought from a movie.But whats truly sets this movie apart is its heart. Amidst the chaos and destruction of the epic monster battles, there are moments of pure emotion between the titans and the humans, and what brings ""The New Empire"" is the new bonds that were made between the characters for me.This is by far the best addition to the Monsterverse yet, it has all that we asked for and its truly a masterpiece, thank you Legendary, This will probably be one of my favorite movies ever made!!! And you MUST watch this on IMAX for the best experience! :D.",10
Dudes rock,"Starts off as (and sadly that hue does stay during most of the movie) another run-of-the-mill, generic hollywood tentpole blockbuster. From the weightless cgi looks to the boring dialogue and characters, the first act of Godzilla x Kong didn't do much for me. However, as the film progresses, it started to show off its bonkers ideas and charms one by one, and slowly & ultimately managed to win me over. This cinematic universe slowly drifted away from its dark, grounded, almost disaster-movie-like origins of godzilla 2014 as it went on, and after watching gxk you wouldn't believe they're even set within the same continuity. Gone are the rains, dust and night-time battles of king of the monsters or the vibrant, operatic cinematography larry fong achieved in skull island. In gxk, 90% of the battles are set in broad daylight, and the camera spins, cuts, and turns upside down (director adam wingard goes crazy in some shots) to maximize and display these battle of titans in a cartoon-like manner. You are basically being waterboarded with cgi spectacle, and that's not a bad thing! As someone who was turned off by the way godzilla ran in the first trailer, i kinda do miss the old aesthetic of the monsterverse, but i can't deny that what they achieved in gxk is helluva fun. I was basically cheering inside during the third act. They cut off all the bs (mostly) and solely focused on delivering a bonkers, digital, fantasy-like colosseum for the titans to punch and throw each other. Also notable is the role of kong as basically the protagonist of the movie. Contrary to godzilla, who gets less screentime and is treated more like a force of nature/beast he is, kong acts, feels, and emotes more like a human. There is an interesting contrast between kong's human-like and godzilla's animalistic behavior. Most of kong's scenes works as a dialogue-free fantasy action film about a lone warrior wandering this fantasy world and bonding with a child.Hollow earth where exotic creatures dwell, ancient hidden civilization in there, huge temples built with shining crystals, hidden lore of monsters, portals, giant monkey tyrant riding an ice dragon, anti-gravity action sequence, and historic landmarks being destroyed disaster-movie-style. You can not fully be on board with the new direction, but you can't deny its charm and fun.Also forgot to mention godzilla fighting an radioactive(?) sea dragon in the arctic. Think this maybe qualifies as a gonzo blockbuster.",7
Brain dead but entertaining,"Look with a title like that, you can understand the internet's disappointment when the two titular titans don't kiss...The fact that Godzilla x Kong comes so soon after Minus One redefined what it means to be a Godzilla film, The New Empire looks more and more like the bigger, dumber cousin you're mother would insist you play with when you were a child. If I'm honest, you come to this film for the sheer kaiju-smashing spectacle and not much else, because it doesn't have much else to offer. It starts with a lot of promise but takes itself too seriously and becomes tediously long and drawn out... also barely any Godzilla in this Godzilla movie. Dan Stevens and Brian Tyree Henry are desperately trying to make this one-dimensional material work. I thank them for their service as they were easily the most likeable part of the cast. Meanwhile, Adam Wingard's direction is nothing special and Junkie XL sounds like he fell asleep on his synthesisers half the time, ultimately leaving Godzilla × Kong feeling like the lesser parts of the Showa era, dumb fun with nothing much to cut your teeth into and not a lot worth giving a damn about.",5
Sublime,"Everyone is just comparing Godzilla X Kong The New Empire with Godzilla Minus One which is such a bad move. These two films have completely different tones and should not be compared. Legendary can make Godzilla movies with Godzilla -1's tone but we must also welcome something different. The action sequences are out of this world and CGI too. Human characters are not the best in Legendary's monsterverse, so we should get over that by now. Be sure to watch it on the big screen. The vibrance is also an another feature of this film that makes me fall in love with it. Maybe it won't be received well by the critics but the audience makes the movie successful and the the audience will LOVE it. A thumbs up from me. 👍",10
The monsters continue to entertain,"The epitome of turning your brain off. This film is ridiculous and it knows it. It fully leans into the campiness and fun of the situation and thus the film is a fun time overall.The highlight is definitely Kong and his plot line. This film and Godzilla vs Kong have him be the main focus and the film does a good job with conveying his thoughts and feelings with little to no dialogue (sort of). His journey feels the most fleshed out and the villain is probably has the most personality of any monsterverse antagonist. In contrast, Godzilla gets very little other than going around killing monsters and helping out in the 3rd act.With the focus more squarely on the monsters, we get a lot more action and it's pretty good. The CGI is great and the action choreography is pretty good as well. The plot simply acts as a means to get from one fight to the other, with no attention for consistency or logic.Unfortunately, the major drag of this film, like many monsterverse films, are the humans. They all exist to spout exposition, state the obvious or intervene at a pivotal moment in the story. They have very little character and their arcs are pathetic. The only bright spot is Trapper, who feels like just the kind of character the monsterverse needs more of. Someone who sees everything ridiculous going on and seems to be enjoying every second of it.Overall, Godzilla X Kong is exactly what you thought it would be. Turn your brain off for 2 hours and simply bask in the ridiculous premise and the epic monster fights.",6
This movie is neither for kids not for adults,"When I was a kid, in mid nineties, I watched Godzilla and dragon movies in theatres and was mesmerized. So, I took my kids to this movie with high expectations. But, this turned out to be a huge disappointment.There is no logic, no realistic situation and no serious story telling attempt.It's like 'ok, let us get Godzilla and Kong together and add some good VFX, it's more than enough'.We were expecting some real badass character against Godzilla+ Kong, since it was hyped that not even Godzilla + Kong can defeat this character.But, this character turned out to be a dud and didn't live up to the hype, not even to a small extent.Whole movie is without any logic. It is as if the VFX guys came up with some series of events while making the graphics.There is one scene where the space ship captain is killed. What other team members do? Just continue with their exploration without even sparing a moment of thought for their fellow mate. And how do they return back in the space ship later? The dentist flies the space ship just like that. Random characters do stuffs like we see in cartoon for toddlers.When Kong gets hurt, they already have a perfect solution in place. They exactly knew that such a thing is gonna happen, as if they had done a time travel and got the tech ready.We can list many such bloopers. It completely fails to connect with audiences. Even my 12 year old son started pointing out such stupid acts and asking me the reason. I didn't have any answer.Please get some good script writing team into action even if you need to do away with some VFX members for the sake of getting an engaging stuff. We have enough of this VFX stuffs where we need to lay our brain to rest.",3
The Most Epic & Crowd-Pleasing Spectacle In The Monster Universe,"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (2024) :
Movie Review -Adam Wingard's previous flick in the monsterverse, Godzilla Vs. Kong (2021), even defeated the pandemic, so you can imagine the growing popularity of this cinematic universe. With Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, this cinematic universe of monsters has gone to the next level. This is the most epic, most explosive, and most crowd-pleasing spectacle in the monsterverse or any monster flick since Godzilla (1998). Those days of Jurassic Park (1993) and Godzilla (1998) are gone. Those childhood memories can never be matched. But yes, these new generation monster flicks can create new memories for new-age kinds and provide big-screen entertainment to all kinds of audiences. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire does exactly that. It may still be a kid-level story as far as on-paper creative ideas are concerned, but the visual extravaganza is too powerful to notice its lukewarm storyline. It's not Godzilla vs. Kong, but it's Godzilla and Kong! I hope that takes your excitement to a whole new level.The film begins with the introduction of Kong, who is seen fighting some fox-like creatures in his den. The next scene has Godzilla's entry, who is sleeping inside a circle-like building. Godzilla's first fight is with a spider-like giant creature, and after that, he is seen sensing something and being attracted to it. Dr. Andrews (Rebecca Hall), her adopted daughter, Jia (Kaylee Hottle), Bernie (Brian Tyree Henry), and Trapper (Dan Stevens) follow Kong through a mysterious Hollow Earth, where they discover a big threat. The untold origins of the Titans and Skull Island are set to destroy the Hollow Earth, and Kong and Godzilla must join forces to beat those powerful monsters.The story by Terry Rossio, Adam Wingard, and Simon Barrett is strictly for kids. Despite some techno-savvy and resourceful elements, the screenplay doesn't create any excitement for the upcoming events. However, it all becomes very interesting and fascinating because of the visual effects and the presentation. Cameron introduced us to the blue people's god ""Ewa"" in 2009, and here Godzilla Vs. Kong has an ""Ewi"" community, coincidentally in the blue theme only. Their God is yellowish, though. As mentioned above, it's not Godzilla vs. Kong, but Godzilla and Kong. Now, this one spoiler is allowed to set the mood right and hype you up a little more.It's like a monster version of ""RRR"" (2022). First, the two powerful and fearless heroes are against each other, but in the end, they must come together. In that film, Jr. NTR and Ram Charan were seen running through fire. Here, you'll see Kong and Godzilla making a whistle worthy entry through ice and fog. Not just that, but the next 15-20 minutes are packed with explosive and larger-than-life action spectacles with a lot of crowd-pleasing moments. In one scene, Kong is seen trying to save himself from Godzilla, but the very next scene has Kong carrying Godzilla's tail on his shoulder. Hell, that's some blockbuster monstrous stuff.The performances by Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, Dan Stevens, Kaylee Hottle, Alex Ferns, and Fala Chen are expectedly decent. Brian Tyree Henry brings a few laughs here and there, whereas Kaylee Hottle walks away with many important scenes. The production value is extremely beautiful, and the VFX work makes it a proper large-scale spectacle. Forget the other action scenes of Kong and Godzilla; those last 20 minutes of the film are alone enough to make your tickets worth their money. You'll clap, scream, hoot, and jump out of joy at seeing what's happening on screen. Before the film, fans were divided into two teams: Kong and Godzilla. But after the film, they will celebrate it together. Ben Seresin's camerawork is fine, and Josh Schaeffer's editing keeps you on the edge of your seats for nearly two hours. Adam Wingard extends his monsterverse with additional characters like Skar King, Mini Kong, and Skimu. The franchise is not limited to just Kong and Godzilla now; there are more, and that's why this one's more entertaining, more audience-friendly, and more massy. Wingard makes sure that you have a great time at the movies. Go and enjoy this gigantic entertainer in cinemas near you. Godzilla and Kong fans are in for a treat.RATING - 6.5/10*",6
Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire is a well-executed American addition to the monster universe that warrants a viewing,"My daughter and I caught Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire (2024) at the theaters this evening. The plot delves into King Kong's journey in Hollow Earth as he searches for others of his kind, only to discover a species with intentions to dominate Earth. Meanwhile, a Monarch agent cares for a young girl from Kong's island who shares a unique bond with the giant ape and believes he's in danger. Determined to help Kong, the agent leads a mission to Hollow Earth to uncover the truth and potentially save him.Directed by Adam Wingard (known for You're Next), the film features Rebecca Hall (from The Town), Brian Tyree Henry (from Bullet Train), Dan Stevens (from The Guest), and Kaylee Hottle (from Godzilla vs. Kong).Godzilla vs. Kong boasts an abundance of CGI, reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy or Jurassic Park, which surprisingly worked for me. The film successfully navigates the challenge of uniting Kong and Godzilla in a way that should meet expectations of fans of the monster universe. This picture is filled with exhilarating and visually stunning monster fights that are the highlight of the film. Godzilla's presence is particularly impressive, and Kong's battle upon arrival in Subterranean Earth is an epic standout moment. The evolution of the baby gorilla is fun to watch too. The film pays homage to historic Godzilla films with numerous Easter Eggs, while the storyline is adequate and essentially takes a backseat to the monster action. There are numerous sequences that only work because this is a monster universe movie and can't be taken seriously; however, the solid performances from Brian Tyree Henry and Dan Stevens provide enjoyable comic relief to offset any overdone scenes. Additionally, the soundtrack is solid and the concluding battle elicited an applause from the audience (including my daughter).Overall, Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire is a well-executed American addition to the monster universe that warrants a viewing. I would rate it 6.5/10 and recommend giving it a watch.",7
Just watch and enjoy,"I have to say that this movie is totally entertaining and a good movie for time spending with family. Nothing heavy, nothing complicated, easy to watch, so just enjoy your time with a bucket of pop corn and watch this movie.Kayle Hottle is so lovable, cute and pretty, while her acting is not much but she got what it takes.Dan Stevens, the character is way too cool and easy for him, but his charm says it all since the beginning to the end.The CGI is very good, so enjoyable and definitely not too cartoon.The storytelling is so easy, nothing complicated for everyone to enjoy and be happy with all the problem solving provided.",7
Not my cup of tea,"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is exactly what you expect it to be: big, dumb, and loud monster fights. For some people, this might work - if you love some of that rock 'em sock 'em ""Transformers""-like large-scale action, you'll get what you came for...eventually. Otherwise, this was a gigantic waste of time; a silly, pointless, illogical, and soulless film that is missing everything that makes these iconic characters special. It was like watching a kid play with their Godzilla and Kong toys, there's no substance to it. I loved Gareth Edwards' 2014 Godzilla film, with its excellent visual style and sense of scale and tone. But this is no longer that (no disrespect meant to director Adam Wingard) - it's visually incoherent and lacks any sense of scale or weight. It's almost like it's become a cartoon of what it once was. And honestly, I think Godzilla Minus One broke the Monsterverse for me. I'm more interested in deeper stories that use these creatures in more intelligent ways. Godzilla x Kong is mostly fine but it's cinematic junk food and the epitome of empty calories. The novelty has worn off and the sense of gigantic scale is lost with too much time in hollow earth. Plus I'm just really not into the ""big monkey punches big lizard"" fights anymore. Some will love this, but it's just not for me. If you liked the first Godzilla vs Kong, then you'll for sure like this! A little too dumb and mindless with nothing else really going for it. Heck, Godzilla and Kong only appear intermittently in the first 90 mins, which is bogged down with boring human exposition before our titans even share the screen. When they do it's one of the most ridiculous, anti-climactic, generic team-ups imaginable. Nonetheless, it's hard not to be entertained watching giant monsters fight, and at least they do this well. As Rotten Tomatoes summarizes: ""Come to Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire for the sheer monster-mashing spectacle - and stay for that too, because the movie doesn't have much else to offer.""",5
Godzilla x Kong: the new empire.,"What do peeps want from these movies...? Monsters fighting? Titans fighting each other? This is a solid movie! Good entertainment! Fast paced and pretty well told. You don't have to see the other (Godzilla, Skull Island, Godzilla v Kong) movies to understand this one. Humans and Titan's together fighting a new enemy. Scar King and Shimo. Plus a special classic Titan makes a comeback. Wew! Nonstop action and fun. My 12 year old son was rooting for G-man! My 16 son was only there for Kong. My wife loved Shimo. I, cheered for them all. This movie is a classic as much as Godzilla v Kong. My family had a great experience seeing this movie. Cheers.",10
Quite a surprise!,"""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" unleashes a colossal spectacle that's sure to satisfy fans of monster mayhem. With jaw-dropping visuals and adrenaline-pumping action, this epic showdown between two iconic titans delivers on its promise of thrills.While the focus is squarely on the epic battles, there's enough heart and character depth to keep audiences engaged.Director Adam Wingard crafts a visually stunning and exhilarating ride that earns its place as a standout entry in the monster movie genre. For a pulse-pounding cinematic experience, ""The New Empire"" reigns supreme.It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be & that's worth something.",7
Why did people like it so much?,"Good thing to say about this film, the truth is that I didn't have many expectations in terms of the script, but there is no where to take it 😂.If your intention is to see an intelligent film with script twists, this is undoubtedly not your film.Now if you're looking for an epic fight between a radioactive lizard and a monkey, you're going to get what you're looking for.In this installment, two new creatures join in, against which our protagonists have to fight hand in hand, Kong and Gozilla.To finish with the review I am going to give my grade based on:Script: 3
Special effects: 8
Soundtrack: 4
Acting of actors: 5Final grade: 5.",5
Best of the series so far and very entertaining,"This is very entertaining movie with lots of big boss fights and all the action you could possibly handle. Seeing this at the cinema was a great ride. Not perfect movie in any form or way, but having a few beers and watching big huge monsters fight is something special.The negatives are that the CGi is not always perfect, but it does not matter too much. Another thing is that the first team going down under seem inadequate. Not really the people (at least not alone) you should send on this type of mission. The third thing is that things get a bit too much. The characters are over the top, the dentist dude is way over the top, the action is over the top. We do not only have big freaking monsters fighting, we have an ice monster aiming to bring in a new ice age, we have some alien things, weird anti gravity technology, and humans just happen to have a big freaking mechanical arm ready for Kong - which of course is a perfect fit. It all culminate in a enormous fight on Earth's surface which is also over the top.Extremely entertaining, but otherwise kinda meh. Still the best of the franchise so far and it is hard to really complain.This is not an intellectual movie, and will never win any awards, but whooooooo cares. You wanted a huge monster movie with big monsters fighting, and that is what you get.8/10 for this type of movie, but a lower score otherwise. Also a must see in the theatre - the sound design is amazing.",8
Fun Surprise,"What a fun surprise! I'm not a faithful kaiju fan though I have seen enough info to at least know what the Showa Era style is. When this movie was announced I didn't think this is where they were going but I think they did pretty good for adapting that style to a modern big screen. Also it shouldn't have to be stated but there's no sense in comparing this to Minus One and that should not take away from either experience.I'm judging this movie based on the style they were aiming for. Though the Showa Era can span from somber to straight goofy we got the feeling they were going away from the somber end of things with this one. Me personally I'm still a much bigger fan of the 2014 tone but that's not to say I can't enjoy myself here.All that being said we finally got some human-free monster interaction and communication. It works very well for me too. I do like the humans as I think they're the key to perspective in these movies. I do think the humans need to tone down on the silliness a little bit though. Expect a joke attempt for most scenes containing them.I liked how the humans integrated into the conflict here it was pretty interesting and especially hearing the story of the Titans for what hasn't been explored in these movies yet. I just think some of the scenes don't hit as hard as they should since I was basically waiting for a punchline. I want humans, I just want them done in a certain way.These monsters have WAY more personality in this one. In GvK we had some mean mugging and attitude but here we have that and much more facial expression and emotion. Some of you may like it some of you may not I don't think there's any way to know other than seeing it.This story moves FAST. Too fast. That being said, I get it, there's also a TON of story to get through. I could've sat through another 30 minutes though. Honestly I would've taken an extra 30 minutes of fighting and 30 minutes of context. I have no problem with long movies so that's just me.The fights are what you come for. This is no Minus One and it doesn't need to be. The movie has an ""Infinity War"" feeling in my opinion at one point. The gripe I have is some fights needed to be much longer. I know Godzilla is the king and I love watching him win.. but I still need to feel like it's earned especially with the context in his part of the story. There are some crazy sequences in this one and I'm glad they simply said we're going this side of the Showa Era and we do not care. That being said it's not straight goofy but it is pretty creative and cool. I think they adapted that Era to the modern Era perfectly as far as fighting goes. I just needed them to last longer. ESPECIALLY THE FINAL BATTLE. I guess it's more of a 2 part final battle but that second part was much too quick for me.Still. If this sounds like what you're looking for, go see it. I even say this isn't my favorite but I had a hell of a time. This movie is not designed to be analyzed critically it is to be injected into your veins as kaiju juice. There are still some things holding it back from that type of movie being better but it's still worth it in my opinion.",7
"Entertaining enough, but forgettable","Sadly this has to come after Minus One. If not, in itself, it would have been quite a lo more entertaining.Personally, I do not like the new choice of color for Godzilla, it brings no added benefit that is memorable, and kinda looks metrosexual.Kong's power gauntlet is just too convenient to be ready for him. Makes little sense.And Mothra makes a surprise appearance... or is that a mosquito with butterfly wings? The team really needs to revise the look of Mothra.Overall, the movie is entertaining enough, but easily forgettable. Not as good as the previous installment, and pales in comparison to the first.",5
King of the Monsters is STILL the Best,"I'm gonna be honest and just say, it's meh. I still think that King of the Monsters was the best of the 4, and after they introduced mechagodzilla in GvK, everything went downhill in terms of plot. Is the movie wonderfully cinematically pleasing? Yes! The visuals are stunning and the CGI just gets better as it goes, but it's hard to enjoy all that when the plot is so god awful.Spoilers ahead:
What part of telepathic people makes any sense in a monster vs monster movie? And why can Gia teleport? Everything about the IWI tribe in this movie made no sense to the whole plot and seemed pointlessly forced.And scar king was cool and all but he wasn't supposed to be the major threat, Shimu was supposed to be the big bad wolf and they spent a lot of time making it seem like she was a threat to global security given the fact she caused the ice age. But then she ends up just teaming with Zilla, Kong, and Mothra in the end and submits to Kong as if she's not another alpha titan who would fight for dominance.The monsters in this movie compared to the other movies seem so weightless as if they're not hundreds of thousands of pounds, 300 foot tall killing machines. And why are they so human like? It just seems like a lot of the movie made no logical sense, and you'd expect that from a monster movie, but it's honestly just too much.Overall I still enjoyed the movie, but it's probably one I wouldn't watch several time just for fun with how pointless the plot felt.",6
Wish I had this as a kid,"This movie is awesome! I went into it being dragged by my friend for his birthday as has become our tradition with this franchise. I haven't enjoyed a single movie in this franchise, until now. Now, let me get this out in the open, this movie only works if you don't think about it. I hate it when people say that and I never do, but here I think it's warranted.The main characters are saying their guesses on the current situation that turn out to be the exact explanation constantly. They basically just exist to explain the insane sci-fi/fantasy that's happening. Hieroglyphics are interpreted, not only in great detail, but also without a single misread. The robot hand they made for Kong (for some reason) just happens to be stored in hollow Earth (for some reason) right where they crashed (for some reason) and it has the medicine for frostbite in it, (for some reason) etc...But that's not really what this movie is about is it? Look at the title. And that's where this movie shines and delivers on their intent. I want Kong to have a robot hand, I don't want him to lose his hand, I want the plot to move along and for all these crazy/cool things to exist, so who cares? For whatever reason it works. The bread and butter of this is great and that's all that matter.The dumb stuff wasn't even all that dumb. I only rolled my eyes a few times and the rest was tolerable enough. It really did feel like a kids/preteens movie or big budget B movie. And there's nothing wrong with that. Because if you make a movie like this that knows what it is and tries to be nothing more, that's just fine. There is a bad way to do this and a right way. This could have been much better of course and it could have been a lot worse. But I'll take it. The little boy in me was satisfied. And kids need movies like this. I loved ""Con Air"" when I was a kid, I don't now. I didn't love ""The Insider"" as a kid, but I do now.The monster stuff was well done and there was a lot of it. I was actually surprised at how many scenes without dialogue there were and how well the story and characters came across. I found myself hooked into all of the thrills and chills which made me think, ""Am I actually enjoying this?"" The crazy world that they created with hollow Earth and the ice lizard and all that mythology was very cool and reminded me of being a kid playing with my toys. Especially, the Scar King. When that name was first said I was game. His spine whip was very cool. The creature designs was also very cool.They did very well at letting this be a monster movie. Normally it's crammed with human stuff that you really just don't care about. I think they finally figured out how to make an American monster movie. Dan Stevens was really good. I thought his character was going to be really annoying at first but he's a good actor and his naturalistic stuff was a good addition to the team. And he did comedy very well. He wasn't a badass but he knew what was going on. A big laugh came out of me when Kong laughed after knocking out the Scar King's tooth.I kept thinking that this was the movie I wanted to see as a kid. I loved Godzilla and King Kong as a kid, maybe without ever actually seeing a movie about them. I just loved the idea. The only movies I had growing up in the 90's were the originals, which were boring for a little kid, great now and the Japanese movies, which were either too cheesy or hard to find. So I'm glad that kids from now on will have this to satisfy their love of monsters.",7
A Monster Brawl Extravaganza,"First of all, don't read/listen to all those reviewers who have no idea about how the monsterverse works, especially the ones who compare GxK with Minus One. They both are movies made for their own monsterverses POV respectively. Those who still choose to compare them have no understanding about the word POV.Here's the real review for all the monster lovers out there. Yes, Adam Wingard has definitely listened to all us monster lovers and has made what we asked. More of Monstrous Action. Offcourse no movie plot, revolving around planet earth, can ever be made with 0% humans involvement, unless it's a Jurassic era documentary, so we do get a small boring human plot.The Move is filled with Monster action sequences which are epic, but some scenes did lack originality, like controlling shimo by a small piece of crystal which just automatically glows without any on/off button or some hypnotic effects only when pointed at her. CGI at various points are quite messed up. But afterall we've got what we wanted.The human plot was just stinky. Some parts were actually essential but the rest just a bunch of meaningless & ironic plot filling crap. I mean what was all that Iwi technology, crystal pyramids, anti gravity, etc, etc... BS!. A Titan vet as a full time profession... seriously!?. Apart from Kong which other Titan is gonna examine & take care of. Rest of them will straight away be ready to gulp him up. They had a metallic arm support, which is readily available in the hollow earth, just in time. It's like as if they knew kong's gonna get only his arm right arm injured. Cringe alert!Adam did try to add more of some comedic plot compared to GvK. Some people did buy it. But like i said earlier, its just a meaningless plot filling crap.Regarding the cast performance, Kaylee Hottle just had 1 worried face expression through out the movie. The rest of the cast did try to give their best in whatever screen time they had.Overall it's a great & money worthy popcorn flick, satisfying the fans monster brawling needs, but with a cringey human plot.",7
Why people are praising it?,"This is the right time where Hollywood should stop making these Godzilla and apes movies atleast for a decade.So in this movie Godzilla decided to light itself with pink lights and fight against a Godzilla like creature with white lights and freezing properties. Then there are apes, Wakanda people inside hollow Earth with great CG technologies and do nothing. Seems this movie ain't made for watching but to put cool lights on silver screen.We have few human characters as well. Protagonist, wisdom girl, cool white guy, compulsory funny black guy and one guy supposed to die about which no body cares. So all these characters go on a simple mission which turns out to be existential threat to earth so these people watch a bunch of monsters fight until credits roll.",1
Heavyweight beatdown,It's exactly what you want in a movie with Godzilla and Kong. The story is so so but the action and the visuals are incredible! Not to mention the sound design is top notch too. These are the movies that are made to be seen on the big screen with friends. If having fun at the movies isn't for you then what's the point? The villains and other monsters are a nice addition and even a surprise appearance from someone with definitely make Godzilla fans smile. Hopefully this has a sequel because who doesn't want to keep watching these Titans fight it out WWE style. Go see it on the biggest loudest screen you can!,10
Plenty of Awesome Kaiju Spectacle,"Taking place after the events of Godzilla vs Kong, Kong settles into his new home in the Hollow Earth. During his stay, he encounters more of his kind including a small red ape who starts out as hostile, but begins to trust Kong. However, with this discovery comes a new threat: Skar King, a tyrannical leader of apes who controls a titan with ice powers. Kong must get the help of his rival Godzilla in order to take on Skar King and his weapon. Kong is accompanied by Dr. Irene Andrews and her adoptive daughter Jia who is close to Kong, Bernie Hayes the conspiracy podcaster and newcomer Trapper who helped heal one of Kong's wounds.Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire delivers exactly on what the trailers promised. I have heard that this movie puts the human characters to the side a bit and gives more spotlight to the monsters. While I think the humans got a little more screen time than I thought they would have, this movie definitely focuses on Kong and the civilization of apes he discovers. This movie is Kong's story and what I like a lot about this movie is how his scenes are handled with his expressions and actions. The relationship between Kong and Suko is the perfect example. We can see when Suko slowly begins to trust Kong as he shows the young ape kindness just from his eyes. These scenes do a great job with show and do not tell. This is definitely where Director Adam Wingard's passion for the source material comes into play. I can tell that Wingard set out to make a movie about the titans rather than the humans dealing with the titans. I really enjoyed the scenes where Kong is traveling through Hollow Earth and discovering the other apes. They are interesting, intense and fun especially the scenes with Kong and Suko.Skar King might be my favorite villain from the MonsterVerse. He has the most ominous presence I have seen from a villain in a while. Just the way he walks around his army, how he smirks at Kong, the way he controls Shimo and how he uses his awesome weapon makes him such a memorable bad guy. Shimo is pretty fun, but a bit more of a minion than I thought she would be. My only major complaint about this movie is that I really wish Godzilla got a little more screen-time. I understand that this Kong's movie and that Godzilla is more of a force of nature than a character, but I would have loved to see him either destroying more monsters or spending a little more time fighting alongside Kong.The action scenes are fantastic. This is a movie that is packed with action from nearly beginning to end. My favorite set piece is one that takes place in Hollow Earth that involves zero gravity. It is one thing to have kaijus battle it out, but it is another to have them fight from rock-to-rock. That whole fight is a joy to watch and it reminds me why I love seeing these kinds of films on the big screen. Another fight I like is Kong's first encounter with Suko and two other apes. Yes, it looks a bit goofy, but it is so entertaining to watch Kong use Suko as a weapon to smack the hostile apes. All of the fights are enjoyable to watch because they are shot expertly and they pack a punch.While I prefer the visual style of Kong: Skull Island and GvK to this, this movie is not without striking images and creative set designs. I love the use of purple in this movie particularly with Godzilla. He looks more powerful than ever. Some of the sets on Hollow Earth look really cool, especially the temple which fits Hollow Earth well. The special effects for the monsters look amazing as they are so expressive and lively, that it gives them more character. Their powers look great and their designs are very impressive. The scale is interesting here because the monsters are now in a world bigger than Earth making them seem a bit smaller than they are. I love the scene where they return to Earth to remind us their massive size. This is a great looking movie that shows how much fun Adam Wingard had directing this movie between the colorful visuals and the crazy fight scenes. The soundtrack is decent with a nice choice of song at the end and a solid musical score by Tom Holkenborg and Antonio Di lorio.I think the human story is okay, but not particularly inspired. The cast do a great job, especially Kaylee Hottle as Jia who is wonderful in this movie. Hottle is a deaf actress and she does a fantastic job expressing herself especially with her interactions with Kong and with her adoptive mother. She is the heart and soul to both this and GvK. Brian Tyree Henry and Dan Stevens look like they are having the time of their lives here and Rebecca Hall gives a very committed performance as Dr. Irene Andrews. The actors are definitely game and they are fun to watch. My problem is that they are kind of just here along with Kong for the ride. Jia is the only character who has a major role in the story.The tone of the movie is very goofy with plenty humor that mostly landed with me and a lot of scenes that make little sense. There is a scene where one of the humans gets eaten by a plant out of nowhere and it is not brought up again after that scene. This feels like watching a Saturday morning cartoon more than any of the other MonsterVerse films. It works for this film because of all of the MonsterVerse movies, it has the most absurd story. This is an adventure into a brand new world that comes up with an excuse to bring Kong and Godzilla on the same side. This is a movie that knows what it is and it does not hold back on the cheesy plot and the bombastic action scenes.I have a lot more to say about Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. However, I would have to get into spoilers at that point so I will just say this. I had a great time with Godzilla x Kong. I got exactly what I wanted from the movie. This movie has some amazing action scenes and goofy moments that make it more enjoyable to watch, but it also has a lot of heart. This is a movie where I can tell that every person involved in the production had a blast making this movie. Now, I am excited to see what new direction the MonsterVerse will take after this.",7
Godzilla multiplied by Kong = ?,"What does the x in the title mean? Godzilla multiplied by Kong? Or Godzilla's ex Kong? Which one is it? So there is earth beneath surface. How the heck does it get sun to have all that vegetation and look as bright as Amazon's jungles? Is there another sun inside the earth for the Hallow Earth? Trust me I put my logical brain utterly in coma to be able to watch this movie but it was still too dumb of a movie. The acting, dialogue, everything else is just as bad. Almost everyone is either angry or agitated and awaiting dooms day even when nothing has happened yet. Jokes are flat and out of place. It feels like the early generation of AI has written this movie for a bored wanker with monster fetish.",1
"Don't listen to haters, go watch it!!","It's disheartening that perpetual dissatisfaction and biased reviews are prevalent in the industry. It's great that you found ""Kong"" to be the best addition, appreciating Kong's leadership and the entertainment value. Each film has its own storyline and merits, making direct comparisons less meaningful. This installment seems to stand out, offering a fresh perspective and an enjoyable experience.Some folks are never happy, and some critics might get paid to write bad stuff. But it's awesome you think ""Kong"" rocks! Kong's a cool leader, and the movie's super fun. Don't compare it to ""Godzilla Minus One"" because they're different stories. Each film is unique, and ""Kong"" stands out for its fresh take and fun vibe.",10
It's like they listened to me about the last flick and adjusted this movie accordingly.,"As far as I'm concerned the original could have used less human story and just stuck with Godzilla and Kong going at it. I've said it out loud once and it feels like they heard me. Though the New Empire does have a human story it goes by so quick as to not let too much time linger between the Kong /Godzilla scenes. It threw me off at first cause I was not expecting such a short movie but it was jam-packed with all the monster fighting you needed. Particularly with Kong being a bigger focus on this movie than the other. So much so in fact that you could say that he was that human story I was expecting in the film. The destruction was wicked, No matter what Godzilla's duty to protect this earth in the Monsterverse being created, this movie makes it obvious that we are nothing but insects to this dude. There was something truly horrifying about the Death and Destruction that this movie was showing. I don't think any Godzilla movie was as globe trodding as the New Empire allowing the King of Monsters to commit to some serious genocide defending the planet as a whole. It's a little disturbing and I loved it, but it's the only thing this movie shares with the far better-done Godzilla Minus One.Overall, it's the perfect movie experience.",7
Hollywood has lost the art of making movies,"The tag-line which was one reserved for Bollywood movies, has to be unfortunately used for Hollywood movies.The CGI in the movie was so bad, that none of the scenes seemed believable and creature who both Godzilla and Kong fight together seems to have been left half baked.May be, the creators decided to make Godzilla movie with healthy mix of Avatar, Wakanda, Ironman and a lot of other superhero movies. But didn't spent anytime in developing the script, sets or the CGI.The movie seems to tick all the checkboxes, in terms of DIE. We have a teenage lead, who is mute, and shown to be from some ancient tribe, who is supposed to be chosen to help win this war. Appropriately, called *wisdom girl* in one of the reviews, has only one expression of inquisitiveness throughout the movie, never being able to quite justify why she was the chosen on. To complete the ensemble we have female lead, a pilot who is killed off immediately to show his arrogance and high handedness, a sort of youtuber and a vet. If only, Hollywood concentrated on character building and storylines, then solely focusing on diversity angle while making the movie.In this movie, we explore the *hollow earth* which is supposed to be a world of its own deep beneath the surface of the earth. While the concept sounds exciting, as some scriptures also mention existence of such world, in the movie, *hollow earth* is another name for pandora, or rather poorly rendered pandora. Despite being deep inside earth surface, the creatures, the habitat, even trees and waterfalls grow the same way as they would on surface of earth exposed to all the sunlight. At one moment, we see some sort of bright disc like sun, without any explaination.Might be the creators themselves, realized the mess they have created, so they decided to start he trailer with clips of the movie prequel which is never a good sign. To overcompensate, there is a saturation of chest thumping and shaking noises throughout the fight scenes.May be children might find this movie fascinating, because of colors and concept of hollow earth, but there doesn't seem to be any other redeeming factor in the movie.",1
Primitive,"Primitive , brainless , pointless ...basically less of everything ) Nevertheless , gets 6 stars from me , for a sheer non stop absurd over the top action , which managed to captivate and thrill .Personally ,I dislike all of this new films , which put of all of the known big dudes/monsters/titans in one big mash-up ,couse It feels that all of them missing a lot of themselves by sharing screen time with others...Prefer more old fashioned , classical films .So considering all of the many negative feelings I had towards this film, even before It came out , it's wonderful that it gave me a pleasant surprise ! Overall , decent one time watch!",6
Godzilla needs to start being truly scary.,"Godzilla's reduction to almost a cameo in this one notwithstanding, he needs to start being truly scary. Going ape (full pun intended) in Hong Kong on his previous outing was a step in the right direction. He's no longer seen as the all-benevolent protector of mankind, and he's more than happy to demonstrate that he'll gladly splat humans in planes and warships like bugs if it suits his purposes.When you imagine giant monsters stomping across the landscape, you don't picture overly irritating sidekick characters dropping unfunny one-liners and cracking unfunny jokes. Enough with the tiresome ""comic relief"" trope. No more Bernie, no more Trapper, no more obese Madison sidekick.I've had my fair share of kaiju dreams, and I remember all of them being scary as hell. I'd wake up with my heart pounding away like a piston. There was nothing remotely funny about them. What they were: terrifyingly awesome. And I loved every second of them.Boring family subplot & dense dialogue aside, Godzilla Minus One knew the score. They are not cute plushies that you cuddle with in bed, they are Monsters. They need to start looking and playing the part.",6
Godzilla x Gong review,This movie is good but not great. This movie is mainly about Kong and his journey in hollow earth with the humans trying to help him. Godzilla is sidelined and he doesn't do anything except chill on the surface until the end. This is one of the dumbest movies like when Kong goes to the dentist and gets a gauntlet because he has frostbite. The human characters are better than the other movies in the franchise because they're funnier but it started getting weirder and weirder what they do. The villain was ok but he had no emotion to him and had no ark but he was cool with his bone wip. The action and cgi was really good and carried the movie. It was generic and did nothing new so I'll give it a 6 out of 10.,6
Did a 7 years kido made this movie,"What a waste of time. Totally a brainless movie which made no sense whatsoever. I think the worst ever movie I saw of Godzilla or Kong whether at individual level combined. Totally ruined, I don't think I will be watching any more Godzilla or Kong movie as this movie made a damage to the image and reputation I had for such movies. Normally I dont write a review but wanted to add for this one so that people could get an opportunity to deprive themselves of the trauma lol
I waited patiently for 1 hours and 30 mins thinking something would come up that would make sense or some action but it ended 1 hours 50 mins of non stop nonsense.",1
best movie if of the godzilla franchise personally,This was a good movie to watch alot of titans fighting with the monsters and there is alot of lore in this movie and godzilla vs shimo was a good watching. And this was a master-peace of the movie franchise and i will watch it again when it comes to streaming platforms and i will buy some merch too this how good this movie was. And next kong fight was cool and i really enjoyed a 8/10 fight and the cast was amazing in this movie and the godzila transformation is actually amazing and kong new armor hand was actual amazing and this movie is a amazing movie and i think you should watch it and tell me how you like it.,10
mega destruction,"Godzilla is on the surface battling various monsters. King Kong is now in Hollow Earth and he has a toothache. There is relative peace as long as the two are separated. Something is rising from deeper below. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry), Trapper (Dan Stevens), and Jia (Kaylee Hottle), last survivor of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, all travel to Hollow Earth.This franchise is going all in on Monarch, Hollow Earth, and all that. Previously, I looked at Hollow Earth side-eyed. At this point, I actually appreciate the ridiculousness. It could have gone much wackier especially with Jia. I almost want to see that. At some point, I just relax and enjoy the ride. It's some ride. The mega destruction is pretty cool. I'm guessing that every movie will be destroying a few global cities. The humans are silly meaningless banter and techno gibberish. On the other hand, I don't mind the planet of the apes at all.",7
A Major Letdown !!,"I watched Godzilla Vs Kong a day before watching this and man, what a movie it was! But this one doesn't even come halfway as good as that. The plot was horrible, it felt like the writers weren't even trying to make a good plot. The action scenes are a total dissapointment, and Godzilla was not used to its true potential. This was definitely the worst movie I've seen in a while.I am still giving this a 5 because I liked the journey of Kong through the Hollow Earth and his fight with SkarKing but everything else was terrible, to say the least. The stakes were lacking and the CGI was mid.Overall, a total waste of MONEY! Better go see Dune: Part 2 if you haven't.",5
WOW! This movie surprised me!,"The Legendary Pictures do realy well at that movie. They finally found the balance between how much human and how much monster scene we need. The only thing that makes me not give 10 stars is that there were not enough Godzilla scenes (for me). We only really see Godzilla at the beginning of the film and in the final boss fight. The film was mainly about Kong and the Hollow Earth.But the visuals and effects themselves were very good. The fights were of sufficient length for such a film.So i liked it? YES
There's a post credit scene? No (sadly, we waited 5 minutes to see it but nothing comes)
This is my personal opinion on Godzilla x Kong The New Empire.",9
A roaring good monster movie,"This film starts off by showing how Kong is adapting to living in middle earth, how people are watching Kong to make sure he's ok and also how they are watching Godzilla to make he's keeping humans safe by fighting monsters. Whilst watching Kong a strange signal comes from middle earth and a team of people decide to go down and see what's causing this signal. And they find out that the signal is a distress signal, but what is calling for help and why are they calling for help?Whilst the team of people is exploring middle earth to find out what this signal is the world looks amazing, especially in 3D. And there are some fight scenes between Kong and other monsters and we also see glimpses of Godzilla fighting monsters as well, but I felt like some of these fights were cut short.One of the humans that's exploring middle earth is called Trapper (Dan Stevens) and the jokes he cracks are good. Trapper is also a vet who helps Kong with his arm after it gets injured in a fight with a monster and he helps by giving him this robotic arm. Again gadgets like these are something I would have liked to have seen more of.Even though I thought some of the fight scenes were cut short I did enjoy the monster battle at the end, but one of the monsters in this final fight is Mothra and I would have liked to have seen her do more. Overall though I had a good time watching this film and I'm looking forward to the next film in this series.",7
This movie is an insult to even mildly intelligent viewers,"Horrible piece of basic mash of poo. Seriously who are the people who sign off scripts? Who from the stupio was like ""hmm yes, the script seem to be written by a 5 years old child and the direct already botched a few movies, let's give him millions of dollars to waste again"".Awful story, basic 2D characters, plot is loose like Kong's diarrhea. It feels like an insult to audience's intelligence.Lazy writing, lazy talentless directing. Why anyone hires this dude? Bribing? Networking?Shout to the animators, visuals are pretty good. Sadly even the decent animations can't save this move.God awful. Don't watch it, don't waste your money and time.",1
Entertaining enough for a movie theatre trip,"This film was a solid 7 out of 10 for me. I actually found myself enjoying it more then Godzilla vs KongThe Good:
King Kong was awesome. This might be my favorite portrayal of Kong on the big screen. I've never thought him interesting but he actually was awesome in this film.The human characters were on screen just long enough to care about but short enough not to get annoyed by them. In Godzilla vs Kong the human characters scenes went on for way to long.The giant monsters were actually pretty funny. At one point King throws a rock at a monster that is trying to runaway. Also Godzilla takes a nap if a pretty iconic location.The Bad:
Didn't really feel like the giant monsters were a real threat especially once the inevitable team up between the two title characters happened.Overall the film was solid and works best on a big movie theatre screen. Overall It was better then Transformers 2-5 , Pacific Rim Uprising, Godzilla vs Kong. I would say it aligns with my score for Transformers Rise of the Beast and Pacific Rim.",7
A visual treat!,"Visuals 10/10
Story 8/10
Storytelling 7/10
Action 7/10
Humour 5/10Overall 7/10Beautifully crafted scenes that immerse the viewer in the wonderful world of Hollow Earth and its multiple denizens. Their facial expressions are impressive!The storytelling seems to take precedence over the action with people talking alot about what is going on and who is doing what. But there is alot to tell or else it would be confusing in basically an alien landscape.The action is decent. But feels a little subdued. Were the producers keeping to a time limit, perhaps? I think if they had put extra effort into the fighting, it may have gone three hours. I think they found the right balance.The silly humour lost me a little. It almost felt Michael Bay-ish. Hopefully they do not intend on going this way. I like more dark humour and action in this kind of film. Especially in the earlier movies. They were alot darker. This one seemed a bit too bright and cheery.Otherwise a good outing. Too bad I left it so long until the final screenings to see.",7
Fun Movie That Unfortunately Starts To Turn MCU,"Overall the movie is great when it comes to the kaiju scenes. The major problem is when it comes to the humans. Unlike past installments where the films are 100% serious this film starts to slide into Jurassic World and MCU territory becoming more comedy. They introduce a wannabe Chris Pratt-type character named Trapper to be an unnecessary future sequel love interest for female character Ilene Andrews. His biggest negative is that he gives the movie a cheap excuse to force in classic rock music into scenes where they don't belong. Nobody wants to hear Kiss play ""I Was Made For Lovin' You"" during a kaiju battle. Get that crap outta here! I had to remove 1 star because of this and there being no Godzilla theme.",7
this movie is another example as to why we prefer the original toho godzilla.....,This american made godzilla flick is another example as to why we always prefer and consider the original toho godzilla flicks as the better ones.While the latest minus one film was a great film taking the monster seriously with a great scenario presenting godzilla as a serious menace tro humanity this new american take on the monsters presents great cgi monster fights and nothing else.No character developments no serious scenario indefferent acting and a failure everywhere except the cgi monster battles.Unfortunately almost all of the recent american godzilla king kong remake films are based only in the monster fights excluding maybe only the first 2014 godzilla american solo film which tried to be smg different up to a level.Anyhow u can watch minus one and then watch this film and see how much better is the minus one toho film.That's why the real godzilla is only the original toho godzilla franchise and not these cash in american godzilla remakes which are only for people who want to see the new cgi effects and don't care about taking the monsters seriously.There were parts of the movie so ridiculous that u say wtf is going on here. Since when kong goes to the dentist ? There were parts of the movie that they made it a comedy. That is not good. This is a godzilla and kong film. It's not a crap dc pase IV universe movie to make fun with.The best part of the movie was the final battle but a large portion of the film was boring. At least they could include more monsters but they were more about apes. This was more a kong movie and godzilla was a guest star or something. They even presented mothra in a different way like we used to know her from the toho films and where was rodan ?So i give this a C- and that only for the great indeed cgi battle effects.,4
"An awesome, fun and epic movie that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible.","Godzilla x Kong is an pure storytelling movie. Director Adam Wingard understands the assignment for this movie. The action, the colors, the score, it's everything I wanted from a Monsterverse film. The cast is amazing. Dan Stevens,Brian Tyree Henry and Kaylee Hottle are the best characters. The cinematography is great. Epic Monsters battle is great. Kong and Suko are the heart of this movie. The scale is epic. This is nonverbal story of the Monsters. The Monsters treated as characters with respect and honor. This is a love letter to the Showa Godzilla movies. Godzilla has some cool moments in this movie. People needs to watch this movie on IMAX for the art of cinemas. I hope the future of the Monsterverse to be continue. I loved it very much.",10
COULD HAVE BEEN BEST MONSTERVERSE MOVIE,"This could have been best monsterverse movie of the franchiseScreentime of humans need to reduced next time it was too much in this movie and It could have been much better if skar was shown in first 20 minutes of the movie by telling his origins why he became evil how he got crystal , he shouldn't have been killed he would have come back in next movie for a revengeI have deducted 3 stars for not giving enough screen time for our titans , Movie running on fast pace and Main Villain was underutilized .Pardon me if i have missed something
This is my first review for any movie/showThanks for reading 😊",7
Could not have been worse,"Can't believe we went from Gareth Edward's semi-plausible 2014 Godzilla film to this garbage.This is a movie for kids, that looks like it was made by kids. Every scene cuts within 5 seconds, even if it doesn't require it, just to try and hold attention. Every meaningless plot point is summarized by a zany side character for easy comprehension. And worst of all - they personified all the monsters to make them relatable.What was previously the only redeeming feature of the sequels (gaint monster fights) has been ruined in the last two films by basically making Kong a human. He's not a giant wild ape any more. He makes traps, he slings his axe over his shoulder and he takes a shower like he's had a bad day at the office. You know you've reached the bottom of the barrel when you're only way to get an audience to side with your monster protagonist is to make him all but human.Hillbilly Kong x Misunderstood Ice Godzilla x Transformer Kong x Purple Godzilla x Giant Ewok is the probably the dumbest film I've seen in the last five years. Far from being entertaining, I absolutely hated it on every level and it left me feeling angry that they found a way to ruin the entire franchise.",1
Monsters Shine as Main Characters,"Looooove the new monsters, special monster appearance (no spoilers here), baby Kong. Great throwback feel with the soundtrack and spectacular visuals. Wild battles. Audience applause, cheering. What else do you wanna see on the big screen?? Better visuals than GvK. Would love just a little more Godzilla but when he's there it's awesome, and whatever it's a blast.The monsters are great as more developed characters, but without losing any of their monstrousness. The critics seem to miss this fact and are focused on the human characters, no acknowledgment of depth of monster characters. Umm, this is a Godzilla movie. Name one from the old school where you remember more than one of the human characters.",10
Godzilla x Kong: A Hilarious Adventure,"I'm a recent fan of the Monsterverse and binged them all with my best friend. They are easy films to follow with amazing affects and are very funny so I expected the same with G x K. We excitedly ran to our local cinema to watch it and were blown away.The story is so nonsensical and dumb that it was hilarious to follow. The CGI was incredible despite having the lowest budget of any of these films for whatever reason. I honestly forgot CGI could be good due to Marvel constantly shoving bad effects down my throat.The human cast, while still not great were much better than last time. My only real complaint is that Godzilla is once again shafted hard in this film despite his name being the first word in the title. It isn't as bad as G vs K where he only appeared twice an hour apart from each other though.The battles were amazing and very well choreographed which made for a insane final act.If you like fun movies I'd watch this with a friend.I give Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire a 7 out of 10.",7
Bad movoe,"The casting is abysmal. The lead actress has no screen presence. The military guy is fat with all the military cliches.A life threatening monster has been discovered and the governments are letting a private company handle this. With no fail safe options, no presence of military, this movie just made me shut my eyes.Kong is running from wolves when he can simply climb a ledge. I mean the plot holes are as big as a crater.A life threatening monster has been discovered and the governments are letting a private company handle this. With no fail safe options, no presence of military, this movie just made me shut my eyes.Kong is running from wolves when he can simply climb a ledge. I mean the plot holes are as big as a crater.Definitely not worth your time.",2
Scar King proves Studio Movies is Poor,"I was initially disappointed with Scar King's limited screen time and lack of menace in the movie. It frustrated me how the focus seemed to shift away from the main monsters to human characters, particularly the deaf girl with visionary abilities, making it unclear what the movie's central theme was supposed to be. However, I did appreciate the impressive action sequences and visual effects. Kong's character development was a highlight, with the story revolving around him. Tracker stood out as a well-developed human character who supported Kong's journey. Despite these positives, the movie's mediocrity can be attributed to the insufficient spotlight on the villains, which falls on the studios and writers.",7
A decent monster flare-up,"I watched this movie in cinema today, all alone and by myself. It's an action adventure movie with, as one would expect, not much sophistication or twist on the story front. It manages to be interesting enough throughout though, and it's simplicity is never silly nor is its unfolding overly predictable. The visuals are the main strong point of the movie, with Kong's ever existing hybrid charisma also lefting things up and introducing hero dimension into the mix. I felt some of the monsters were not as exciting as I would've hoped for them to be (respect, King Ghidorah,) and neither were many of the characters involved in this adventure. One thing I'd like to point out here is that I felt watching this movie in 2D did harm to the experience, as I (strongly) felt that that kind of visuals needs to be watched in 3D in order to do it justice; I don't even know if it does play in 3D, but if it does, then go for the 3D version. A good watch overall, I give it 6.5*.",6
Good movie overall.,"Good movie enjoyed it. Went to see it at the imax cinema and it was everything I expected. It was very loud with a lot of fight scenes between kong and other titans he sees throughout the movie. The colour palette was very good. Vibrant and gave it a retro action movie style to it. Jokes landed well. CGi was on point and really good. Fight scenes were amazing especially on a large screen like an imax. Very good would recommended it for fans of the previous movies. The back storey elements were good and gave it a unique feel to the rest of the King Kong & Godzilla films. It was more thoughtful and had a good story line. So wasn't just an endless stream of violence with no real story to it. Very good, well done to the director and the cast.",6
"Awful, Awful Awful!!!","Went to watch this with my 2 sons and very low expectations....my expectations weren't low enough, terrible acting, ridiculous plot that they seem to be making up as they filmed,CGI of monsters and carnage that's been done a thousand times before and a tribe that communicate by thought, and I know what they were thinking.....'Get me out of this terrible film!'
I was hoping for a bit of entertaining popcorn movie fun but came away wishing I'd kept my dental appointment instead.Reviewers on here giving scores of 7/8 out of 10!!!! These people need their heads examining, surely 7/8's out of 10 means a great film?The fact that there were only about 9 people in the cinema on a school holiday should have given me a heads up as to how bad it was going to be...harsh lesson learned!",1
Better than I expected !,"Godzilla x Kong is a triumphantly epic film, blending epic action with moments of genuine heart and a touch of absurdity. Surprisingly, despite its simple and somewhat silly storyline, it manages to captivate. The human characters take a backseat, allowing the titans to shine as the true stars. While the plot may not be groundbreaking, it's exactly what's needed for an enjoyable action flick. It doesn't aim to be complex like Dune; instead, it offers pure entertainment. The story, though straightforward and silly at times, isn't terrible-it's simple and serves its purpose well. While the CGI was good for the most part, there were some corny moments. The music was good, but I felt disappointed that they didn't use the original themes for the titans.",8
Boss Baby x Catzilla: New Meowmpire,"In a generation filled with superhero movies, we take a side trip with this another monster-verse installment featuring... big monsters which typically are also acting as heroes.As distress calls, the likes of Kong and Godzilla must join forces to stop Scar King and his pet Shimo. From their own world to the country of Brazil, the great battle took place. In the end, Brazil was saved but lots of innocent people died and their city destroyed.Lesser human screen time in this film is a good decision but perhaps a bit more focus on the monsters (good luck with the CGI budget) however, the story is still good. Not that an amazing film overall but a film packed with action sequences and more more, meow I mean roars!A good popcorn movie. A good movie in the big screen. A good action packed movie.Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire is a 7/10 for me
PS: I love Godzilla's new Rome, I mean home#GodzillaXKongTheNewEmpire #movies #filmreview.",7
Had to drop my IQ to watch this movie,"Bland & pointless storyOver acting for Kong, Godzilla creatures, they are creatures NOT humanunnecessary dialogueover used CGI, very unnaturalSimply put this movie shouldn't even exist, the directing of this movie is just pointless, my brain felt dead after watching it. Better off watching Godzilla Minus One, story and intention was very clear and plot kept you guessing. Compared to this one, there is no motive what so ever, everyone just appeared out of nowhere.Somehow this movie really needs to be reviewed by movie company before airing. Wish I could request refund for this time wasting movie.",1
A great Monsterverse movie.,"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is the best monsterverse movie yet. It is the most enjoyable film of the year. It has great, groundbreaking visual effects. The cinematography is great. The writing is good. The epic Monsters Battles are great and awesome. The humans characters are good. Dan Stevens's character is the best and Brian Tyree Henry's character is good. It is an amazing pure storytelling. This is an art of cinemas. Family and friends will enjoy the movie very much as I do. People needs to watch this epic on the biggest screen possible as well as in IMAX. Congrats on Adam Wingard and Legendary Pictures. Long Live the Monsterverse!",10
"It's a ""buddy cop"" movie","In the history of cinema, there has been some fantastic performer pairings.Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy; Bob Hope and Bing Crosby; Paul Newman and Robert Redford; Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor; Will Smith and Martin Lawrence; Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly and, of course, the greatest pairing of them all - Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.Add to that list KING KONG and GODZILLA.In GODZILLA x KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE, the 5th in the ""Monarch"" series of Godzilla/Kong films - and a direct sequel to 2021's GODZILLA vs. KONG - Director Adam Wingard has crafted a unique adventure for these two behemoths of the big screen - he put them in a ""buddy cop"" movie.Kong, of course, is the freewheeling, fun-loving jokester who just wants to hang out with his buds, while Godzilla is the uptight, serious, older behemoth who is ""getting too old for this stuff"" and just wants to take a nap.Can these two put their differences aside and team up to defeat a new enemy that is stronger than each of them individually - but might not be if they join together?We all know what the answer to that question is and, surprisingly, this film is a pretty fun way to go about that journey in a CGI-fest, monster punching monster ""Live action"" cartoon.And, that's what this film is. It's like a Saturday morning cartoon where the action is incredibly unbelievable, but still a bunch of fun to watch.Oh...and there's humans around (Rebecca Hall and Brian Tyree Henry from the first film) who stand around spouting mostly dialogue that is intended to clarify the plot points - and the stakes. Gotta give those 2 credit, they deliver those lines like real pros never once winking at the camera as they say things such as ""Kong can't stop this on his own"", and the reply ""He won't be alone"". It's outrageous...and fun.Adding to the fun is Dan Stevens who is over-acting to the perfect level. He knows exactly what type of movie he is in and what his role is - and he does it well.While this Godzilla film won't win any Oscars (like GODZILLA MINUS ONE - no relation to this film - did), it still is a very entertaining way to a few hours in the theater munching on popcorn.And...doesn't that count for something?Letter Grade: B (the very definition of a ""B"" picture)7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",7
Stupid plot and monster-verse even if you suspend all science.,"Worst plot and casting. Weak CGI. Hollywood must think cinema goers are stupid. Beside the main actress, none of the other actors were likable nor had screen presence.Only redeeming 1 minute is when Skar King laughs at Kong for having a silver false tooth!!Not worth the wait for DVD nor streaming.Anything scientific is totally suspended with no logical explanation. This might as well be a fairytale. This is not scify.Only redeeming 1 minute is when Skar King laughs at Kong for having a silver false tooth!!I went to see Ghostbusters but there was no late show so ended up watching this garbage. Waste of money and time.",1
Good luck following it if you're not up to date with the continuity,"Kong has a toothache and Godzilla goes sightseeing in Rome.The thing about this film is that there is previous continuity you need to know. The corporation Monarch monitors Titans - huge potentially (and often actually) destructive monsters. Godzilla and Kong both work against Titans but they hate each other, so Godzilla lives on Earth's surface while Kong lives in Hollow Earth (don't ask, watch the previous film).Things follow on from the setup established in previous continuity, and you might be a bit lost in places if you don't know about Monarch, Hollow Earth, and the Godzilla/Kong grudgefest.Having said that, this is a non-stop special effects extravaganza. Monsters kick the manure out of each other pretty much from start to finish, with a little bit of human interest every now and then to keep us invested. If you want eye candy, this film has it in industrial quantities.But this is basically a B feature with a huge budget.",7
Amazingly Dumb Fun,"I'll just start by saying that if you know what to expect from a movie like this and you still want to see it, then I can't recommend it enough. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is now in theatres and it's probably the most fun, bombastic, silly (as well as dumb) movie in this whole Monsterverse to date. When this franchise began in 2014 with Godzilla and then Kong: Skull Island shortly after, I never expected we would end up with a movie like this one. Look, this movie was made for people who want to see giant monsters fight each other, so if that's all you need from this, it delivers. Here's why this big, dumb movie gave me an awesome experience.Picking up after the events of Godzilla vs. Kong, the majority of this movie takes place down in hollow earth. Still unravelling secrets about Skull Island, a group of new and old cast members journey into the depths of hollow earth, making discoveries about ancestors and possible, current civilization. This continues throughout the movie as Kong discovers a leader of apes, Scar King. This leads to Kong needing the help of Godzilla, who has spent the entire movie charging up at random nuclear locations around the world. Yes, the overall plot is that silly and all over the place, but it all builds up to a 20-30-minute battle sequence that was just pure fun.I will say, as expected, the human story is thin, but I really didn't care, and that's because of Dan Stevens' performance. He knew the movie he was in and he was just having a blast with his character. He livened up the movie when the monsters weren't there (which is also not very often this time around). A nice story continues from the previous instalment about Ilene (Rebecca Hall) and her newfound daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle). But, Kong with a giant robotic glove, Godzilla being the most powerful he has ever been, zero gravity action scenes, and surprise monsters all clashing together just made me smile. If you're looking for something deep, look elsewhere.Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire may have been exactly the movie I was searching for at the time, but I can't deny that it worked for me. The movie's premise is honestly just a bunch of nonsense to build up to awesome action, and that was clearly director Adam Wingard's plan from the beginning. This is a movie built specifically for fans of giant monsters and for that, I have to give it up for it delivering that. Will there be a dumber big-budget movie this year? Probably not, but this is an example of dumb done amazingly well. If this review sells you on seeing it, then I absolutely recommend it.",7
Ridiculous escapism and more!,"Huge monsters duking it out, pyramids changing gravity, nonsensical plot, and fun special effects. There is nothing plausible or anything that makes sense in any way. What you will get is a fun monster movie. People who go to these films expecting Citizen Kane are the more ridiculous reviewers. This is a movie you go in with some soda and popcorn and just relax to. This movie exists to entertain you, so let it. The monster fights and effects are superb and that is all you need. The human characters simply subsist in the midst of the story. Godzilla x Kong is great fun so what are you waiting for? We don't just go to the movies for Oscar powerhouses, we go to have a good time. In that, this movie is what the doctor ordered.",7
This movie made a monkey out of my lizard brain!,"The plot to Kong Godzilla: New Empire is that below the Earth are face painted tribal people who use crystals to control gravity, and who are a looking for a psychic deaf girl because they need her to awaken a mother moth that shoots magical spider webs, in order to unite old man King Kong, his mini-me, and nuclear Godzilla, to stop a big red monkey with a bone bullwhip and an ice breathing lizard dog.It would have been better if this plot had been all monster and no humans, but like the rest of this universe its mostly humans who are dumb and unlikeable and stupid and in this one the humans are the most dumb and unlikeable and stupid than any of the previous films.All four prior films had some charm this one lacks. It's super dumb and not worth seeing in theaters. Just stay home and don't watch.",1
Clash of mosters keeps us entertained..,"Godzilla X Kong the 5th film in Monsterverse is nothing new in terms of story, but it will give you an amazing experience in theatre especially if you are seeing it in IMAX 3D.. There are many great eye popping visuals, epic destructice action scenes and crazy monsters running throughout screen which will keep you entertained for nearly two hours.. Storywise it's nothing new like every other movie Godzilla awakes attacks somewhere which lead him to another monster, they fight and Godzilla wins.. The end, meanwhile some human scientists will do crazy things throughout the movie.. I mean cmon isn't it what all Monsterverse movies are??But some things are meant to be enjoyed without paying too much attention to the story and turn off you brain to enjoy the ride, this franchise is all about this concept.. You'll get some epic action scenes, buildings crumblings to dust, monsters clashing and some drama... I mean what else can you expect from a franchise about monsters. Lol
These types of movies are meant to be enjoyed in theatres without using any brain just to get awesome big screen and sound experience...If you have kids take them out to see this movie they'll love it and maybe you too...",8
"Good action, forgettable plot","""Godzilla X Kong 2"" is a movie that grabs the attention of action fans with its stunning visuals and epic showdowns between giant creatures. The visual effects are mind-blowing, especially in how they portray the battles and the aftermath of destruction caused by these titans. While the film doesn't aim to break new ground, it does provide an experience that allows viewers to switch off their brains for two hours, which can be a plus for those just looking to be entertained.However, it falls short in delivering emotional depth or a gripping storyline, unlike the Japanese film ""Godzilla Minus One."" The human characters are one-dimensional and easily forgettable, failing to leave a lasting impression on the audience. The villain is also weak and lacking in menace, missing the qualities needed to stand out as a true antagonist. In summary, ""Godzilla X Kong 2"" is a visual spectacle that, while offering momentary fun, lacks memorability and fails to evoke a lasting emotional impact.",6
Cliche and horrible written,"Kong enters our world because he has a rotten painful tooth. Giant heli brings a metal tooth to replace it in one minute. Surgeru like that take weeks in real world.At this point I expected Godzilla to replace its tale with a broomstick. Laughable in most terrible way.The reptile goes to recharge by killing Tiamat with no problem doing that.Underneath, a tribe of Kong like giant apes, we found out, are always trying to conquer the surface and bring an ice age with the use of a cold elemental monster imprisoned by the leader of the apes.Mothra appears out of nowhere and, with G and K go underneath and battle the enemies mentioned, than resurface and defeat them.A girl has a shoelace tied around her head and to make her look for us as a native American Indian last survivor of a tribe.Full of cliches and simple action done using CGI, the movie maybe entertaining for kids and teens, barrely.A fail and a painful experience that laft me scarred for life. )) kidding. But, seriously, the movie is lazy bad.",4
Spectacular creature feature continuation!,"Was my first time seeing 2 RPX movies in the same day cause I saw Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire a couple hours before which was great too and I absolutely love how in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire had a lot more to do with the creatures. I didn't see Minus one cause I don't do well with subtitles, I throughly enjoy these ones they deserve to be praised! I very much enjoy Adam Wingard films especially You're Next, The Guest, Blair Witch remake was better than original, and the previous Godzilla Vs Kong was great too! I love that Dan Steven's was a big part of this he starred in The Guest and enjoyable in anything. I hope plenty appreciate this film it deserves it!Edit I got to re watch in imax made me appreciate the movie even more, I love sounds and I'm glad I've seen the last few Godzilla x Kong/ Vs ones in imax!",10
Entertaining,"Godzilla x Kong was an entertaining movie, with enough monster fights to keep you engaged. The story is rough even by monsterverse standards though. Brian Tyree Henry and Dan Stevens are great as comedic relief, but the rest of the human-part of the story really struggled to find its roots. The writers made it too human-centric at times, which is not the reason we're seeing the film. Some plot points you're supposed to just glaze over and pretend that it's okay, which is fine for this universe, but they did it a bit too much here. It's saved by comedic lines and the fact that it never takes itself seriously. Still doesn't live up to the standards of the first Godzilla movie from 2014.",6
Very Average at best !,Action sequences are good and some human characters are actually funny.This shouldnt be called Godzilla x Kong this is a Kong movie Godzilla is a side quest in this movie. The villains in this movie didn't pose a real threat both very mid and the script for this movie was all over the place no steadiness about it all I'm going to say is at the end of this movie you can tell this franchise is going to become very far fetched more than it already is wasnt on the edge of my seat through all 1hr 55min and was very disappointing too much hype around the movie wasn't bad but wasn't good 5/10 for this one.,5
Dumb Fun,"Godzilla x Kong is the latest film in the monster verse. It's weird to get two movies involving Godzilla coming out within several months of each other on completely sperate ends of the spectrum. You had Minus One, which is a serious war drama about a man seeking redemption. This film is an over-the-top dumb fun monster movie. I know many people have put this film down for being not like Minus One. However, it never set out to be. I have always believed that a movie should be judged on whether it succeeds at what it sets out to do. This film sets out to be an entertaining monster fighting movie. Does it succeed in that? More or less.This film, like all the others, is breathtaking visually. The monster fights are good. This movie does deliver on the dumb action beats. When the movie focuses only on the monsters fighting or interacting it's at its best. I just wish Scar came off as more of a threat than he was. While the fights are still entertaining to watch, you never get the sense that Godzilla or Kong are in any real serious danger, like in past films. While I like the human characters more here than in the last two films, they still aren't that interesting, and bog the movie down by focusing on them so much.That's the main flaw with all these films, aside from Skull Island. Like the Transformers movies, the writers and/or producers of these film think the audience needs the human characters to grasp what's going on and to have an emotional tether to the film, but they don't do that good of a job at making us care about most of them. The best character in these movies, by leaps and bounds, has been Kong. If they ever make any more of these films, they should set the next one in the distant past and have no humans at all. That'd be different.My favorite movies of the monster verse are Kong Skull Island and Godzilla vs. Kong. I would put this film just below Godzilla vs. Kong. If you're a fan of those two films, you should enjoy this alright. I enjoy this more than both the Godzilla movies in this line. I did enjoy myself in the theater for the most part. Godzilla x Kong is dumb fun and there's nothing wrong with that. But, if want something on the level of Minus One or even Godzilla 2014 you're not going to get anything out of this.",6
Strong 6 weak 7 so 6.5/10,"It's just one of those big budget movies that you go in for pure enjoyment and are just brainless fun with no specific story to be told but lore to figure out and have in mind when it comes to the kaijus, monsters and the world excluding the humans from it.I don't mind the amount of human interaction that was there but the movie could've done with even less more and human interaction since the story was too straightforward to be told by humans and very understandable to be told throughout the kaijus and the world itself.Visually the movie was great and very pleasing to the eyes and the CGI was great with no specific mistakes to remember. I prefer Godzilla vs. Kong over this one because the whole idea and story was more intriguing.It deserves a watch on the big screen.",6
Enjoyable silliness,"I'm not a particular fan of these movies, but this one was fun.Likeable characters.Interesting storylines - nice progression.Some humour that works.FX are a mixed bag.My main gripe is that I see no redeeming features in Godzilla - it looks silly, it looks sillier when moving at speed, its not cute or impressive.Kong more than makes up for that - especially in this. Has a bit of a hard time, bless him.The movie works and is just on the right side of sentimental.The humans are good too, delivering the expected comedy turns, annoyance and arrogance where required.More words to meet the silly character limit.",7
Couldnt decide what it wanted to be,"My son is a big Godzilla fan, so I took him to see this in the cinema. I'm afraid we had been thoroughly spoiled by last year's Godzilla Minus One, which was a tremendous film (even if you have no interest in Godzilla, it's just a very good film).I was hoping this one would be a next installment of the previous big budget Hollywood attempts. Sadly, no.The budget was there and the monster were great, but this film lacked any real purpose. To the extent the writer / director seemed to get a bit confused at how to play it. It kept lurching from straight action, to exceptional cliche, to tongue-in-cheek humour. The character Trapper being a good example. I wad expecting him to look straight to camera and give a cheeky wink to the audience, half the time.Watch it for the monsters, but don't expect to get anything remotely memorable from the story or human actors.",5
"Fun, Exhilarating and underrated Storytelling!","Godzilla and Kong stand as two colossal icons in the realm of cinema, and their monumental 2021 film was hailed as a savior of theaters globally, injecting much-needed energy with its epic monster battles and departure from the trend of weighty, serious narratives. Fresh from experiencing its latest installment on IMAX, I'm eager to share my comprehensive thoughts on the film.In essence, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire left me spellbound. It delivered a plethora of captivating action sequences, each imbued with excellent camera work and jaw-dropping CGI/visual effects that seamlessly brought the titans to life. However, it was Kong who truly stole the spotlight as the film's central protagonist. His journey was nothing short of amazing, drawing viewers into his world with expressive emotion and mannerisms that transcended dialogue, making the visual storytelling an absolute delight. From heartwarming interactions with fellow titans like Suko to intense confrontations with formidable foes like Skar King, Kong's character arc was a rollercoaster of emotions, culminating in a satisfying resolution that showcased his growth and resilience.The film's action sequences were not merely excellent; they were downright exhilarating. Each fight scene was meticulously choreographed, utilizing established franchise elements with creative flair. From gravity-defying showdowns to pulse-pounding battles in the heart of bustling cities, every moment was etched into the audience's memory, building towards an electrifying climax that left viewers on the edge of their seats. What truly set this film apart was its homage to the Showa Era, seamlessly blending the franchise's trademark goofiness with modern sensibilities, eliciting cheers and applause from the audience at every turn.One of the film's most commendable aspects was its masterful pacing and intricate plotting. With three intertwining storylines - Kong's Journey, the Human Plot, and the Godzilla Subplot - the film kept viewers engaged from start to finish. Kong's narrative arc was undeniably the standout, but the human plot, while not groundbreaking, showed marked improvement over previous Monsterverse projects. Characters like Jia and Trapper added depth and dimension to the story, while the Godzilla subplot provided a constant undercurrent of tension and anticipation, building towards a climactic showdown that was as epic as it was satisfying.Furthermore, the film boasted a memorable villain whose presence loomed large over every scene. Cruel, menacing, and eerily captivating, the antagonist served as the perfect foil to our heroic protagonists, driving the narrative forward with each nefarious scheme and dastardly deed. The film's worldbuilding was equally impressive, offering tantalizing glimpses into a rich and expansive universe teeming with lore and intrigue.Despite some criticisms online, particularly regarding Godzilla's screen time, I found such complaints to be unfounded. While Kong may have dominated the narrative, Godzilla's presence was felt in every frame, his looming shadow serving as a constant reminder of the impending clash between titans. Moreover, to dismiss the film as mere ""dumb fun"" would be a disservice to its rich storytelling and nuanced character development. From Kong's emotional journey to the human characters' personal struggles and triumphs, the film offered a depth and complexity that transcended its action-packed exterior.In conclusion, Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire is more than just a blockbuster spectacle; it's a triumph of storytelling and visual artistry that pays homage to its iconic predecessors while blazing a trail of its own. With its unforgettable characters, breathtaking action sequences, and heart-pounding suspense, this film is a testament to the enduring power of cinema and a worthy addition to the pantheon of monster classics.",10
Delivers what it promises for fans of Kaiju action with a handful of pleasant surprises along the way,"""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is the sequel to 2021's ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" and the fifth film in Legendary Pictures' ""MonsterVerse"". Once again directed by Adam Wingard and starring Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, and Kaylee Hottle, it delivers what it promises for fans of Kaiju action with a handful of pleasant surprises along the way.Following the events of ""Godzilla vs. Kong"", both the giant ape Kong and the giant reptilian Godzilla have agreed to keep their distance from one another, leading to a safer world as a result. Kong has since made his home within the depths of Hollow Earth while Godzilla continues to swim the surface world's oceans only occasionally emerging to attack any invasive Kaiju. One day, Kong ventures deeper into Hollow Earth where he discovers something huge that could threaten the very existence of not only his species but all life on the surface. Quickly realising that he cannot handle this threat alone, Kong attempts to form an unlikely alliance with his fierce rival Godzilla before both Hollow Earth and the surface world is destroyed.Ten years since its debut, Legendary Pictures' ""MonsterVerse"" has managed to give western audiences their own cinematic universe of giant monsters, with Japan's iconic Kaiju Godzilla leading the way in his own self-titled 2014 film. Joining this colossal reptilian from the east is the equally famous King Kong (or just ""Kong"" for short) from the west, who also had similar success after first appearing in 2017's ""Kong: Skull Island"". It was inevitable that these two Kaiju would face off against one another, which is exactly what happened in ""Godzilla vs. Kong"", marking the first time since 1962 that both monsters have appeared in the same movie together. After that fight ended in a decisive draw, it seemed uncertain what direction things would head from there, but in ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"", we see the pair working together in an entertaining follow-up that once again showcases great special effects and that signature Kaiju destruction.Rather than focus on two separate stories at once, this time the plot is mostly centred around Kong by himself. Though he is a powerful and respected figure among the inhabitants of Hollow Earth, Kong still needs to assert his dominance whenever necessary. Much like any gorilla, he demonstrates this through physical combat and by roaring loudly while pounding his chest. However, like any primate, curiosity gets the better of him as he decides to explore further into Hollow Earth to find out what lies beneath. Of course, what he ends up discovering poses a threat to his position of power, which later leads to some interesting lore about the origins of both Kong and the other Kaiju who call this planet home. These scenes are what I would consider to be the best parts of the film, as they allow us to see that Kong isn't just a mindless monster who wants to destroy everything he sees, but in fact a curious animal with a natural instinct to remain at the top of the food chain.Maybe it's the better special effects or maybe it's the better way the mythology is handled but I actually found myself more invested in this story than I did with the previous film. This is likely due to the way the film is told primarily from Kong's perspective, as when we see him learn more about ancient life in Hollow Earth, we are learning along with him. From his surprised expressions to his determination to defeat his opponents, the visuals do a fine job at clueing us in to how Kong must be feeling on this journey into unknown territory. As a result, Kong is a surprisingly relatable character this time around, at least by giant gorilla standards.On the other hand, Godzilla's role in this story has been significantly sidelined in favour of his mammalian rival. Whenever we see him on screen, Godzilla is either fighting off any large miscellaneous Kaiju that dare to appear on the surface or he is swimming around looking for another place to rest. Humorously, it would seem that Godzilla has taken a preferential liking to curling up inside the Roman Colosseum to sleep in the same way a dog might curl up in its own fluffy bed. In any other case, I would be annoyed that the ""King of the Monsters"" has been reduced to playing second fiddle to Kong, but remembering that he has already had two other solo movies that adequately established all we need to know about his character, I wasn't nearly as bothered.As is usually the case with giant monster movies, there are plenty of action sequences and scenes of chaotic destruction that are sure to keep audiences satisfied with what they've paid to see. For example, we see Kong punching his way though large, mysterious creatures who attack him and we watch Godzilla smashing through skyscrapers and other landmarks to destroy any other Kaiju that threaten his territory. Out of all these parts, I found the scenes with Kong to be the most exciting due to him being the more emotionally sympathetic of the two monsters. That's not to say I didn't enjoy Godzilla's scenes at all, as he certainly has some memorable moments too, especially during the film's climax. It's worth noting that most of the time Kong is merely defending himself from opposition while Godzilla is usually the instigator of his large-scale fights.Regarding the human characters, they all serve their respective purpose to the story and nothing more. I didn't really care much for Rebecca Hall or Brian Tyree Henry's roles in the story other than for them to quote exposition that Godzilla and Kong cannot verbally communicate to the audience. Though they were far from annoying, I just wish there was a way for them to have had a more memorable impact on the story other than being the stock humans with scientific knowledge on the titular monsters. It is clear that these two human characters are only there to set things up for the next action scene involving either Kong, Godzilla, or both of them at once, meaning that practically anybody could have played their roles.The closest the film comes to having an emotional moment with a human character is with the deaf girl Jia (Kaylee Hottle), who is able to communicate with Kong using sign language. Without spoiling too much, there is one scene with her and Kong that I found quite touching, which is more than can be said for all the other human characters whose names I can barely remember. At the end of the day, this lack of human drama doesn't really matter because as I said once before; we don't pay to see a monster movie for the human characters the same way we don't go to McDonalds to order a filet mignon. Then again, if ""Godzilla Minus One"" was able to accomplish greatness along these lines, then the potential was certainly there at least.For yet another giant monster movie filled with gratuitous destruction and chaos galore, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is a worthy addition to the decade old ""MonsterVerse"" that promises to entertain with its great visuals and plentiful action scenes. As I said about the film's predecessor, you shouldn't expect anything less from a movie that has Godzilla and Kong's names in the title, and once again that's just what we get. I'm curious to see what direction the franchise will head in from this point forward, as there are a number of ways this story could continue with its already established mythology. Until then, I'm satisfied with simply watching these giant monsters beat the hell out of each other for our own amusement.I rate it 7/10.",7
EVEN MONKEYS LEARN FASTER THAN THESE WRITERS...,"Seriously.. the initial Godzilla remake back in 2014-16 with Brian Cranston was 100x better than the last few Godzilla/Kong movies.The second Godzilla. King of Monsters had the ability to separate itself from the pack and to think all that they had to do is listen to actual Godzilla fans. The monsters are great, the kids aren't.-We don't care about kids/teenagers/families in a Godzilla movie. Godzilla should be the star of the show.-We don't want the story to revolve around kids.Stop with the one liners Hollywood has become so accustomed to. Godzilla should be a rather serious movie not a Marvel/DCU flick.-Fire your writers for crying out loud. The story is SO, SO bad. It is beyond cringe.-Get a decent couple of adult actors. (I mean the scripts are so bad i don't think i've ever seen Vera Farmiga in a worse movie than the second film. Decent writing pulls decent cast. Poor writing if you're lucky you'll get the Rock or Mark Wahlberg.. (Please don't)-Watch the anime series of Godzilla or even the original films, they have a substance you guys will never create.It is called passion.Not everyone has an IQ of 60 and the ability to sit through this garbage for 2 hours. Sometimes i wish i was a complete moron. Then i could happily enjoy the endless dribble Hollywood pumps out.",4
Why the hate??,"This movie was fantastic for what it was. It was a fantastic spectacle to see lots and lots of character development for Kong in this movie, as well just Godzilla himself. I don't know why the critics are bashing this movie so hard... It's not meant to be some modern allegory on the state of the world or anything, it's a Kaiju monster battle. And in that department it delivers heavily, love this movie for what it was not what I'm projecting it to be or what I want it to be. Anyone basing their decision to watch this film based on what the critics have to say is missing out tremendously on a fantastic film.",9
Crazyness unleashed,"Okay, this movie was definitely crazy, but I'm not sure yet if it was crazy good or crazy bad. This is the type of film which had everything, the story kept driving its audience to unexpected places (sometimes very weird places), but somehow at the end it felt like something was missing.I have the feeling like Wingard, the writers and producers. Wanted to emulate the craziness of movies like Thor: Ragnarok, or even the previous Godzilla V Kong, and that was all fine and good. However, it's also evident that they never had much idea what to make with Godzilla in this entry, and as a result his screen time felt much reduced. Most of the occasions he was on screen, though, they made sure for him to take over the show.Most of the fighting scenes also felt quite short, and I don't understand why Godzilla felt so threatened by the villains, but whatever. Kong was the real star of this movie, along with his ""little"" sidekick. The human characters were good enough, and Jia was specially good.In the end, I won't deny I had fun watching this movie, but to me it was a downgrade when compared with Godzilla V Kong. Some aspects of the story definitely felt rushed, which might have been solved if given just a bit more care from the screen writers and the director. Oh well....",7
"From a casual fan, not very good.","The movie has some fun moments and a few jokes made me smile. But overall the movie is a bit of a mess, with really average CGI. I felt after seeing Dune 2 and how amazing the scale of everything felt there, that this just felt really average on a visual level. The fights didn't really do anything for me either. There was alot of fighting but I never got goosebumps or felt excited by any of it. It was pretty underwhelming. Godzilla also didn't get enough screentime! It's a movie made for kids basically. Maybe I'm just getting old! Dune 2 was one of the best cinematic experiences I've had in years, but this fell short big time!",5
Better than previous. Good brain candy,"I watched the 2021 Godzilla vs. Kong movie again right before seeing this sequel, and can comfortably say that I enjoyed it more. Not a great deal more, but it was a fun watch.Both movies basically switched back and forth between three storylines. The big difference for me was that all three storylines in this film held my attention, while only one of them did in the 2021 film. One of the storylines in the former film I didn't care for was the one involving the two annoying kids trying to figure out what was going on, along with an unfunny comic relief podcaster. Fortunately, the kids didn't appear in the new film, and although.""Bernie Hayes"" did, he was a bit more tolerable here. But it's still obvious that he's there just for the comic relief.Although not Citizen Kane, the film did manage to bring together the three storylines satisfactorily, with the typical monster all-monster-battle conclusion. And, as a bonus, a ""guest star"" monster from Godzilla's past made an appearance.Overall, the film was two hours of entertaining brain candy. Like the 2021 film, the special effects were great. And the monsters more entertaining than the actors. As long as you approach it that way, you should enjoy it.",7
"Entertaining, but it isn't like the classics","With the territory dispute settled between Godzilla and Kong, Monarch sets out to monitor Godzilla on the surface and explore Hollow Earth with Kong. As Kong searches for remnants of his species, something has Godzilla in a frenzy on the surface. What they discover in Hollow Earth teaches them more about the history of the Titans and requires Kong and Godzilla to team up to save the world.This franchise has drifted away from the original premise of King Kong and Godzilla but has managed to create something unique and entertaining. The story is simple, with loads of classic characters and some epic battles. The monsters have slowly developed human characteristics and mannerisms, which can be good or bad, depending on the person. Overall, the movie is easy to watch, family-friendly for older children, and has components of the classics, which might satisfy long-time fans.",7
alright,Fight scenes were top tier and the action was good only part I didn't like was the part where the girl was basically the main character they did not even try to make her a main character she would've been fine as a side character or maybe I just see her as the main character because they haven't even set the main character yet unlike in Godzilla king of the monsters also for some reason the didn't go in the direction of government trying to capture and study the girl wasted story maybe next time also they're over using the Godzilla x kong formula it's gonna get stale quick they should go back to solo movie or introduce another charecter.,7
Why has CGI become so crappy?,"Why has CGI become so crappy?And, most importantly, why do we tolerate it?I won't comment on the acting, direction, editing, or even the plot-it's Godzilla vs. Kong, in any case-but I will comment on the terrible CGI in movies of the last couple of years, like 'The Flash.'It seems like CGI artists have given up on trying to make photorealistic effects and replaced them with crappy visuals from video games of the previous decades.Bad compositing (the mix of CGI with live action or other elements), unrealistic coloring, unnecessary flares, cartoonish movements, and... well... you can forget about physics.This movie feels like the opening of a video game from the 2000s. The first 'Jurassic Park' from 1993 is far more convincing. You can't watch and have an emotional connection with movies like this.If it's supposed to be a cartoon or animation, just say so.If we continue to endorse and support creators who don't care about quality, then it's on us.Perhaps they know that the end is coming for them due to AI and stopped caring.Overall: Not just avoid, but punish movies like this one. Maybe they'll start trying more.",1
It is one of the best movie in monsterverse.,"I saw this movie on IMAX 3d recently, At fast let me start with the good things I found about Godzilla x Kong the New Empire this movie has good and the best VFX and action, I saw Godzilla in many forms most likely blue thermonuclear, and last pink thermonuclear forms was awesome, and new character suko is very cute and Kong adopted suko, and mothra's special appearance and was amazing and giving a great slap to Godzilla, and kong rides on Godzilla giving goosebumps and all the fours are crashing. Talking about a human character like Bunny's acting was very funny, The new hero trapper's last entry is so cool. Now let me say that I was as disappointed about Godzilla x Kong when was Godzilla fighting with Scylla for just 10 seconds and Tiamat also just 20 or 33 seconds I thought it would be at least 1 minute. Btw I want to see this movie 1 more time. Thank you to Adam Wingard for thinking of such a great story.",9
Kaylee Hottle stole the show amidst obnoxious monster fights and lukewarm characters,"Godzilla x Kong: The New EmpireSo, we got a Godzilla & Kong sequel with a really alluring trailer thanks to its undeniable cool factor, and I'm somehow inspired to check it out despite not being that well-versed with the Monsterverse, let alone being a fan of it. But I got a friend who is, and the trailer does manage to elicit enough curiously within me to go out of my way to see it, so how was it?. Well, that feels like déjà vu, does it not?. Didn't the 2019 Godzilla installment get me to contort my body in all types of ways and yawn up watery eyes thanks to sheer boredom?, well, suffice it to say, it's happening again for a second time. Despite that, I'm willing to give this one the benefit of the doubt as my stomach is rendered uneasy thanks to certain things I've been consuming recently, which also affected my whole body, (seriously, I just feel fatigable the whole day, what's that all about?), as opposed to how I felt watching King of the Monsters almost half a decade ago with my aforementioned best friend who's a Monsterverse aficionado, while being fit as a fiddle. In other words, yes, it's a bit better but not by much. And the reason this movie manages to earn slightly more meritorious qualities is two words, Kaylee Hottle, yes, the taciturn superstar that stole the show once again, she did it on the previous Godzilla film and she did it again here. Seriously, there aren't enough levels of verbosity that can do justice to an encomium that she so ever deserves since her primordial appearance in the franchise two years ago. Her performances are stellar as she plays an intrinsic role to the film which renders her preeminent while everyone else is concomitant, thank you, Adam Wingard, not to mention she's also responsible for some of the more tear-jerking moments in the film which correlates with sentiments of not fitting in, letting go, and undying love for one another. And yes, the whole thing about her not making friends, grades in a state of dégringolade and being an outcast at school is all too relatable, feels like they're calling me out, the only difference is, she's deaf and I'm not, so stop complaining, you inutile piece of.... But anyways, I feel like I gave a fair amount of conferment towards the star of the show already, let's move on to the rest of the cast, shall we?. Now, while they're not bad, they're nothing great either, they're just generic mediocre figures that are so heavily outshined by Jia's character, that if she wasn't here?, this would fare worse than King of the Monsters for me. The supposed ""comic reliefs"", Trapper and Bernie, the easygoing immature vet and a fraidy influencer who wants to prove to people he saved the world once, are not funny nor are they obnoxiously bad, they just don't really do all that much for me. And as for Jia's mom, Ilene Andrews, her presence is only accentuated by Jia's presence for being her cornerstone, which I will commend her for, but aside from that?, she's just as lukewarm as the other two present here. But of course, the price of admission is paid to witness gargantuan mindless monsters beat the crap out of each other while roaring at the top of their huge lungs every 5 minutes or so. And yes, while we do get an abundance of that, it's not something I particularly find to be all that interesting to be honest, overgrown ugly simians (the word rhymes with ""hideous"" for a reason) too dumb to know anything else beyond collateral damage running rampant against each other is a lot more lackluster than I initially thought it would be. Of course, what elevates them from just being soulless primal smackdowns are the subtle themes of survival, respect and teamwork, in order to avoid spoilers, I'm not going to fully expound what took place, only that I find the action sequences, despite being well made thanks to boasting state-of-the-art special effects and adept CGI workers, to be discernibly laborious when compared to scenes with Jia in it, I'm sorry. And I'm watching this in an Onyx cinema hall where the seats vibrate and stuff, that's saying something. Yeah, all in all, it's a decent film, I do think the previous installment hit slightly harder thanks to fairly compelling villains abusing the power of science and intelligence and action sequences that's considerably better thanks to its more sci-fi elements, courtesy of Mechagodzilla. But this one's not too bad either, mostly because of Kaylee Hottle, she brought the previous film out of the realm of just being solid, and now she brought this one out of the realm of mediocrity, much love, she's worth the tickets alone. If the initial allure of mindless monster action and pulchritudinous sceneries to expose the audience to Kaylee Hottle's Jia's more compelling character arc and performance was the plan?, then I'm on board, solid stuff.6/10(845 words)",6
Terrible,So I had to take clients to the movies today and this was the only one they hadn't seen so this was what they picked.I was expecting a monster movie and not anything really intelligent but these kinds of movies can still be fun. I was totally wrong.This movie was terrible. I have seen many films and this was honestly one of the worst I have ever seen. If I wasn't with clients there is no way I would have sat through it.The actors had nothing to work with and they were kind of pointless. It was just basically 2 hours of cgi and really loud noises. How many times did these creatures need to howl.I haven't seen the first one and I never will. Total garbage and it should be avoided.,1
Titan tag team,Godzilla X Kong is a big improvement over the previous entry king ve Godzilla especially with the human element which was so cardboard last time . The CG is done very well . Although the new rival of kong seems very generic another giant ape called skar king . And then a whole tribe of giant gorillas and a baby one with a napoleon complex . The team up tag team between Godzilla kong and skar king happens of late in the movie . Mothra makes her grand appearance as the moderator telling kong and Godzilla to set aside their alpha differences to battle skar king and his enslaved ice breathing giant lizard . Which is the opposite of Godzillas radioactive breath . It's a fun movie just watch and enjoy the ride . Here's one spoiler alert . No post credit scene .,8
Kong is the star,"Skull Island was so well done
What they're doing and did with king kong is great.His part of this movie plays out like a western.It's just great.The other stuff is useless
Sure Godzilla is cool and does his thing.But the people in these Godzilla movies and the way they tell you what is happening as you are watching it happen or just watched it happen is mind numbing.There is no use for these people at all
And the dopey ancient backstory is so unneeded
Let it go
Leave it to the monsters.I sat and put up with the dopey humans and enjoyed the destruction from Godzilla
But. I loved the King Kong story and his scenes .King Kong 10/10
Godzilla 8/10
People 0.0/10.",7
Pretty Bad Movie,"Rating: 5.5
Overall, a very stupid movie that has a dumb plot because the movie just feels like Kong ft Godzilla, but has some merit in watching with its visual effects, cinematography, and grand monster-filled fight scenes.Pretty Bad Direction (The direction is only good on a macroscale because the movie is only about building this vast mythical world and the massive fight scenes; the direction on a microscale is pretty formulaic and bland as many of the performances just feel like they fill time; the storytelling is not good as the movie does not create a coherent story, it just feels like they force a bunch of plot points together), Decent Acting (Decent to Pretty Good from Rebecca Hall (Plays the lead decently well and holds her own in getting the most out of the rest of the cast), Decent from Brian Tyree Henry (Really tries his best to be the comedic relief character, but he just isn't given good material to work with so he misses his jokes a lot), Decent from Dan Stevens (Has charisma that makes his character likable), Decent to Pretty Good from Kaylee Hottle (Does a pretty good job at being the emotional vulnerability in the movie and how she is a conduit between different groups), Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Just a bunch of formulaic, tent-pole performances)), Bad Story (The concept is so stupid because it just has dumb plot points, like the first 20 minutes of the movie is about how Kong has a toothache; the plot structure is a complete mess as they focus way too much on Kong that this movie feels like Kong ft Godzilla; the character writing for the humans is very shallow and formulaic, the character writing for Godzilla is very shallow as he's just there, the character writing for Kong and the apes is pretty good as its all about finding a home), Bad Screenplay (The dialogue is very stupid; the humor is pretty bad because it has a high miss rate; the symbolism is kinda forced, but surprising present despite how shallow it is; the foreshadowing makes the movie predictable), Decent Score, Good Cinematography (I don't know why they used IMAX cameras but they used it well and helped show this mythical world), Good Editing, Very Good Sound (Really helped bring to life the monsters and titans (especially Godzilla and Kong)), Good to Very Good Visual Effects (This movie is really about the visual effects as it helps bring to life the world, the monsters, and their fight scenes), Pacing is incredibly slow as this movie feels like it drags (the first hour just feels like exposition); the runtime could've been 20 minutes longer to help show the relationship between Godzilla and Kong because it is very forced, Climax is very short even though it is well executed (Godzilla and Kong are only in the movie for like 20 minutes together), Tone is just a stereotypical action monster movie (very Michael Bay-like), This movie is Kong ft Godzilla because the two are only on-screen together for like 20 minutes and their relationship is super forced.",5
A Tribute to the Showa Era,"First off understand this movie shouldn't be compared to Godzilla Minus One and is a movie based on the Legendary Monsterverse movies. Fans who are going to see this movie are going to see this movie usually because of the Showa era influence that the director Adam Wingard was going for with the flavor, and he did just that with this film in a more modern way.I knew what I was in for when I saw the preview and having seen Godzilla vs. Kong I had a good idea the direction that this movie was going. The preview built up a lot of anticipation and I learned nothing was exactly as perceived from seeing the great looking interesting and action packed previews.This movie is the movie I've been the most excited about seeing this year being a major Godzilla fan and I am pretty easy to please when it comes to these movies, and not the most critical of these kind of films. I am going to mainly focus on what I loved about it with out giving anything away that the previews didn't.First off is how colorful the movie is and the theme of it being similar to 80's movies which there will be times where the great songs reflect that aspect of it. I really loved what they did with the music I had to go ahead and say. The hollow earth truly is a breathe taking world that reminds me of Pandora from Avatar and also similar to Indiana Jones with in it.The movie is far more about the monsters than it is the humans compared to the previous movies and the human characters are more so used to speak for the monsters story where about midway through I enjoyed one of their roles the most in telling the monsters backstory, but I will have to say if this movie even was just the monsters I'd probably still be happy. The human characters however prove to have their place eventually to set the plot into motion, such as Gia who ends up playing a really important role.The monsters truly are characters and have much personality who come with some humorous moments. Kong is like a Cowboy in a way and almost feels like Clint Eastwood to me. Skar King who is the orangutan villain you see in the preview really comes across as kind of an western villain with his attitude and mannerisms. Adam Wingard even said in the commentary from the previous movie that he saw Kong similar to a western character like Clint Eastwood that I thought was great inspiration to incorporate with Kong and Skar King in this movie.The battles are what most people will be raving about and are a blast to watch go down in this movie and we're talking battles that have never been seen in a Godzilla movie before with much inspiration from wrestling and will please those kids at heart who enjoyed their Saturday morning cartoons. Again, we're talking Showa era inspired here.I felt by the end the movie had much heart and I actually found it surprisingly, moving enough. It truly is a epic blockbuster to me, but one common complaint is how viewers would have liked to see more action and I for one wouldn't have minded that. I mean a good movie will have you asking for more and maybe that being the case is valid.This movie is more Kong's story than anyone else with his human counterpart Gia mirroring his journey. Another common complaint is how people would have liked to see more of Godzilla, but with what you get to see with Godzilla left me satisfied enough, and room for what could come in another movie more focused on Godzilla, and potentially one last one from Adam Wingard that I would love to see from him.I was real happy that I saw the movie in IMAX and would highly recommend it for families, as the kids will absolutely love this movie more than likely. It was what was so great about the Showa era movies. It's a great popcorn and soda movie that brings non-stop action with amusement and does have purpose one should understand by the end who gives it some more thought.",7
Big fun and goofy,"Godzilla and Kong The New empire was definitely worth watching. The scenes are amazing, and the monster fights so much like the old Godzilla monster mash ups but looking even better.True there isn't much human interaction except for a few scenes, but the characters, the human ones, were tolerable. You've got to remember this is a monster movie. People want to see monsters fighting, and you get those scenes in spades. The human storyline is secondary.Overall, this is a big silly fun movie that checks all the boxes for monster mash ups. I enjoyed it for what it was, great entertainment to turn your mind off to and have fun.",7
Good but felt rushed.,"It felt like too much happened too quickly but with that said it didn't feel like anything should've been cut out of the movie. It could've benefited from maybe a longer run time to better explain certain things that happened or at the very least add something that explains how much time has passed. One second Godzilla is here and now he's here. Kong is doing something important to the story, blink, oh he's done now even though it seems like it should've taken longer. Some of the sound seemed washed out. For example Godzilla's roar just didn't feel loud or intimidating but that could've just been the sound system in the theater I was at. Despite the rushed scenes and possibly poorly mixed audio it was nice to have Godzilla and Kong be the stars of their own movie instead of humans like the other movies made by legendary. Would watch again.",7
CGI apes punching CGI reptiles.,"I like a good Kong or Godzilla movie. I really, really do. But this wasn't it. As usual the creatures dominate the narrative and the people are there for exposition, but really, this is just an excuse for FX mass destruction.May be it's just me, but the sheer loss of life that would have gone down in Rome, Cairo and Rio would have been immense. Godzilla again traverses the globe in seconds, without explanation. One minute in the Med, then pops up in the Artic. Kong can escape Middle Earth, sorry Hollow Earth by somehow climbing out, while to get in, requires dropping miles through a swirly whirlpool.Caught it playing in 3D but there's nothing in it that warrants seeing it in this medium. Also the long periods of just FX creatures interacting and fighting was, and Im sorry to say, boring.",5
Godzilla x kong: The New Empire is fantastic!,"Godzilla x kong: The New Empire is another fantastic entry in the monsterverse which even better than the previous film (Godzilla vs. Kong) and more than delivers with its huge spectacle and great titan centered story, and surprisingly entertaining human cast, its great ride and will leave any Godzilla and Kong fan who wants to see the two team up against formidable foes more than satisfied, the action scenes are spectacular, the human cast this go around do actually are pretty entertaining and aren't boring like you'd expect, the visuals must be seen on the biggest screen possible, skar and shimo are great villains that give the big G and mighty K a run for their money, and this film is all around another great installment in the monsterverse from Adam Wingard.",10
Good movie with flaws,"Just saw this movie last night in a theatre that was half full. These movies have felt like a 6 or 7 out of 10 for me and that is about what I expected. And that is what I got. It was great to watch Godzilla and Kong and they did a great job on the graphics and the fights. They seemed to listen to the main complaint in the last Godzilla vs Kong movie, that they wanted more fights with Godzilla and Kong. However, the plot did not make sense. As with most Godzilla and Kong movies, the plot for the people is terrible. As usual, they tried to make the people save the day in a way that is unrealistic and adds nothing the story.Overall, the movie is worth seeing. You enjoy Godzilla and Kong and want to fast forward past the people to the fights.",7
My brain hurts,"Yay, another Godzilla vs Kong movie, a chance to lose shed excess IQ points faster than rapid onset dementia.The movie starts with Kong on his island escaping some big dogs and killing one in an unnecessarily gory fatality movie. Scares other dogs away.Kong has toothache after been punched by evil red ape. Goes to humans for dental service, gets big dumb anesthetic injection and big dumb metal tooth from humans. Humans go dumb side story with shamans and mystical stuff my brain dont understand. Boring lady has boring romance with boring australian guy. Also boring mute girl. Movie thinks it's avatar for a while but after long boring time goes back to monsters fighting.Kong is good ape, red apes bad, except for red baby ape so movie not racist against red apes. Show individual can be good and prejudice bad. Red ape control ice power godzilla with glowing rod. Red ape ride ice godzilla. Real godzilla now with pink energy. Kong roar at pyramids. Pink godzilla climb on gibraltar rock, also roar. Next scene fight at pyramids. Smash pyramids. Glowy moth appear and then friends. Then scene with disco music. Other music garbage, go ""braaaah"" and ""bam baaaaam"" all movie, but disco and synthwave tracks fun. Human characters lame. Everyone different accent, can't understand.Random beach scene with samba music. Maybe in Brazil? Camera turn around, then Red Ape and Ice Godzilla vs Kong and Pink Godzilla. Big stupid. Big fight. Baby red ape show up. Kong steals fatality move from Sub Zero. Kong x Godzilla x Mortal Kombat now.My brain hurts. But am dumber now. Therefore happier. Next monster movie when?",1
Peak,"This movie was AMAZING. Its a Kong centered movie, with Godzilla making cameos here and there but it's fine, I like both of them equally. I was little bit iffy on Godzillas new evolution, but it's grown on me, he looks WAY more powerful than he was in the previous films. And of course the best part for me was the final battle: Godzilla and Kong charging at Skar King and Shimo, and fighting in zero gravity. And of course Mothras return was especially amazing, also its cool that Kong has adopted Suko as his son and formed a bond. All the Minus One stans can screw off. 1,000,000/10 Would watch again.",10
"Not a bad movie, just not a good Godzilla/Kong movie","It feels more like this is an Avengers movie and not a Godzilla/Kong one.Sure it's a fun watch, and there's cool moments here and there. I also liked the villain a lot, the way he moved and his facial expressions were really uncanny and a bit scary. I would've liked to see more about him, how he became the king of the giant apes, his fight with Godzilla in the past and his banishment, and how he defeated Shimo.I didn't like that Godzilla did basically nothing the entire movie. Almost all the focus was on Kong and the little iwi girl. They could've sold the movie as ""Kong and Mothra"" as well, because she had pretty much the same screen time as Godzilla.And I don't know how to feel about Kong feeling ""sad"". He's been shown as this unstoppable force that only responds to that iwi girl, kinda like Hulk. But now he's acting more like a human: he gets sad because he doesn't feel comfortable in his new home, he is grossed out when he gets dirty in a fight, he pretty much cries because of a tooth infection and goes with the humans to get help.And there's also a lot of conveniences in the movie. Like when Kong gets frostbite and they casually have a giant gauntlet made specifically for him that's undamaged and ready to use. Or that Mothra is there and only the iwi girl can wake her up, and then the huge ""special attack"" they can only do once by clashing the two giant crystal pyramids, which doesn't even do that much honestly and feels like they wasted it.I don't regret watching it, and I didn't have a lot of expectations after watching the trailer, but it's just a mediocre film.",6
"Less humans, more monsters","""Godzilla and Kong"" is a simple movie in its premise, since it only wants to entertain and to show big monsters fighting, so it has also to be judged in this framework. Unfortunately the movie is not able to achieve this due to useless and long boring sections centered around humans and their story arcs. Indeed when the movie shows the monsters it is good (for what it is) with fun and entertaining scenes. Furthermore the monsters are characterized thanks to convincing facial expressions which are able to convey what they are thinking. On the flip side the parts featuring humans are boring and, most importantly, too long. They were present also in the previous chapter (Godzilla vs Kong) but they were shorter and less serious. And so, in the end, if you'll be able to overcome those scenes and they will not become an issue to you the movie will feel fine and fun. If however, like in my case, these scenes are able to provoke a lot of boredom, the viewing can be more problematic. Indeed when the movie flows it is very good, when it features the humans it's the total opposite. In my opinion 15 minutes less dedicated to the humans and a shorter movie would have created one of the most entertaining blockbuster movie of the year.",5
I learned two words: Hollow Ground and Monsterverse,I did not know there was a Monsterverse but that seems apropos for a movie about two gigantic prehistoric creature monsters that are always warring with something or somebody.I went to this movie for mindless escape and that's what I got. A lot of loud sound effects and huge monsters filling up the screen.The story -- what story? It meanders all over the sci-fi fantasy universe.How did Godzilla and Kong get into the same space to duel over Europe? I dunno. But that's where you suspend disbelief and just laugh it off.The kids will love it because it has loud and roaring noises and the special effects of the Hollow Ground are eye popping.,7
It's No Minus One But Still Very Enjoyable,"The New Empire doesn't exactly shed itself of all the issues I've had with the MonsterVerse movies so far but it thankfully lessens the things I've been frustrated with and it made for quite a fun ride.Don't get me wrong the characters still aren't up too much. I don't think they're that deep or particularly memorable but they are likeable. They have genuinely good chemistry and even if I felt the film could've taken itself a bit more seriously at points, I still found it a lot funnier than it had any right to be. There's also significantly less of them compared to King of The Monsters and Godzilla Vs. Kong and it does wonders for the pacing.Since they're not trying to balance so many characters and subplots it makes the whole thing feel much more streamlined and I can honestly say I was never bored, which was not my experience with the last films. It's very fast paced but more importantly it always felt like there was something important happening. Don't get me wrong it's no masterpiece of writing, the dialogue is still bland and the story non-existent but for what I needed from this film it hit just the right sweet spot.I also loved the fact that there were whole sections devoted exclusively to Kong. In past instalments this time probably would've gone to boring human characters but this is much more along the line of what I want to see. The kills are brutal, the action's fun and even if it devolves a bit too much into CGI noise in the 3rd act I still thought it was fun with some actual sense of scale.After very little anticipation from me in a long stretch of these movies that I haven't really enjoyed this was quite a pleasant surprise. It's not immune to all this series flaws but it's been more than refined enough to create for an enjoyable experience. It's no Minus One but it's a lot more fun than I ever would've expected.",7
A Kaiju Ape,"Wow I don't know how to explain this movie, it was great in resolution and talking. Now this was a great movie. I don't even think there are words to express how this was made. The animation was great. So much was added to this short movie. I say short mostly because it's shorter than an average movie of 2 hours. It had so much story not just on kong but the Iwi tribe as well. This is a must watch, not just on a TV, in the theaters. Now I don't like to put spoilers but near the end towards the middle was a great scene. I thought this movie was not going to be moving via worldwide. But the part I didn't like about this was the fact that the fights were at world known visitor spots. Rio, Egypt, Rome, France. Besides that it was awesome. Watch it please.",7
Watching Godzilla X Kong made me realize,"Just how great a great movie Godzilla Minus One is. It had a miniscule budget, the special effects were better and the story was far superior.GxK was so farfetched and unbelievable (and yes I know a giant monster movie isn't really believable but still) that you just don't end up caring what happens in it. I can see the director thinking ""Let's put in a lot of color and Kong will wear the Infinity Gauntlet because that's what fans like"" to hide what a mess this movie is. I also can't stand putting dumb characters into a movie for ""comedic"" effect. No one talks or acts like the stereotypical dumb character does.In the end I was actually hoping Skar King had defeated Kong and Godzilla. At least that way the franchise could have potentially ended on a fairly exciting note instead of going out on an embarrassing movie like this one.",2
Masculine Masterpiece,"Only people with high enough testosterone level can truly appreciate this movie. It was a truly eye opening, philosophical and beautiful on so many levels piece of cinema. The conversations, the cinematography, the acting... it was all a masterpiece. I cannot express how grateful I was to the world we live in for providing me with the unique opportunity to witness this heavenly movie, which looked like it was provided by God almighty himself. I loved how the director made godzilla sleep in in the Colliseum thus referring to the glory of the Roman Empire. Between the incredible plot they managed to even put a history lesson by shooting different scenes in a historical cites.",10
"""GODZILLA X KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE"" REVIEW","Directed by Adam Wingard. A runtime of one hour and fifty-five minutes. With a PG-13 rating.The next film in the ""Monster Universe"" and the sequel to ""Godzilla vs. Kong"". After the events from the last film, ""Godzilla,"" is the head honcho of his territory, ""Earth."" Fighting and killing any Titans around. If you follow the TV series ""Monarchs"" on Apple TV+, you will know there are a lot of Titans on Earth.""Kong"" is the superior being in his territory, ""Hollow Earth."" He keeps himself busy trying to learn his new home and regulate it. While still always yearning for a family.""IIene"" is one of the directors at ""Monarch,"" and she watches over them both. Her daughter, ""Jia,"" played by Kaylee Hottle, is now trying to adjust to life on Earth and being separated from ""Kong"".This is all a big pill to swallow, but as long as both Titans are separated, there will be no bloodshed. Well, at least from those two. But something is off. There may be a new player in the mix.""Trapper"" played by Dan Stevens, who is the veterinarian for all massive species. ""Bernie,"" played by Brian Tyree Henry, and his conspiracy theory podcast are back to help save the world again. Along with their security, ""Mikael,"" played by Alex Ferns.They will all travel to ""Hollow Earth"" to investigate a weird signal they've been receiving. The results from their findings may cause these two natural-born enemies to have to work together. Hopefully, they can and hopefully, they will defeat whatever threats await them. In their latest mashup film.""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" was a bunch of monstrous fun. I went with some of my family members who consisted of three women. They range in a variety of different ages. From eighty-two to nineteen, we were all entertained.I didn't have high hopes that they would all enjoy it, especially when I asked Nana if she remembered who ""King Kong"" was. Her reply was ""Isn't it about a gorilla or something?""
I busted out laughing because of the simplicity she gave this massive franchise with this massive character that goes back decades. This is one of the reasons why I love Nana; she will make you laugh for sure.Well, the gorilla and the lizard showed up and showed out, entertaining all of us. At one point, I didn't know if I was watching an ""Avengers"" film or a ""Kong and Godzilla"" film. The action was jam-packed, and frankly, they were doing things that they shouldn't be capable of doing.There were a lot of parts that were overdone or very wonky. Something made you scratch your head and ask, ""How the heck did they get to this point?"" It didn't make sense at times but just go with it. Shockingly, ""Godzilla"" in all these films has very little screen time. In this film, he didn't even crack double digits. It doesn't matter, though, because you can't tell while you're watching it.A film with a lot going on. That still won't stop you from having fun and being entertained while watching it. It pleases people of all ages, which is comforting to know. Box office smash, so expect another film.I love ""Godzilla"" and especially ""King Kong."" He didn't disappoint, and he made sure to let everyone know he was not to be messed with, no matter who you were. ""Kong"" walked around with the you know what energy the whole film. Try not to take certain scenes too seriously. Just enjoy this film on the biggest screen you can find. I give this film four mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

"Meh - Been there, done that...","Initially when I saw the trailers for Godzilla x Kong, I was a bit excited for the new entry. A team up of the 2 most well known modern day monsters with all out action? Normally this should be a slam dunk but I think the problem with this movie is that there is literally nowhere to go with the story that we haven't been.In a nutshell, the scientists working at Monarch detect signal anomalies that are coming from Hollow Earth but can't figure out its origin and who is sending them. They trek on downward, discover the signal's origin & discover that there is a villainous gorilla like Kong who is trying to escape and reign terror on those living up top. Godzilla & Kong team-up, hence the title of the film, many punches and kicks are thrown along with a few wrestling-esque moves and the villain is defeated.Doesn't really sound too bad for a plot. In fact, in this movie, they finally put more emphasis on the monster's story over the human story and let this drive the chaos and spectacle. The bad part is, there really isn't anything new that we haven't seen in the past 3 Godzilla movies & Kong: Skull Island. I'm sorry but there are only so many times I care to watch Godzilla & Kong fight other giant kaiju monsters threatening humanity/Earth before it simply becomes boring. Is the action fun? For the most part it is entertaining and the pure visual spectacle in the IMAX version which opens up from standard letterbox aspect ratio which the previous movies didn't makes for a fun & entertaining ride. But again, we've seen both Godzilla & Kong fight monsters and destroy cities to last us a lifetime.Add to the fact that the cgi visual effects that show us Hollow Earth looks really artificial and weak and you have what amounts to a middling film. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely places where the vfx blends well or looks appropriate but there are definitely clear spots where you can tell it's not photorealistic at all and that is disappointing considering the money spent on this compared to last year's Godzilla: Minus One which was far superior visually.Is there anywhere left to go with this franchise? Not really, unless you just want more monster chaos & action. I think if they put out any more movies in this series, they need to be 90 minutes or less. Any longer and it will just become more and more boring and lead to fatigue.Go see this if you're a kaiju/Godzilla/Kong fan, it will deliver. Wait for it on streaming if you're hoping for something more along the lines of Godzilla: Minus One.",5
Impressive and straight forward,"Technically super impressive! The story is also very straight forward! If you like Godzilla and Kong, it means you came to see gigantic fights and massive scale screenshots ...and that is what you get watching this movie! And to get the ultimate engagement you have to watch it at cinema, dolby or Imax. I watched it in a dolby cinema and enjoyed it from the first minute to the last. Not sure why it had 6.7 score, does people expect a complex story from a Godzilla and Kong movie?! I decided to give it a high score because it deserves it. You cannot compare this movie with e.g. Dune. I expected a straight forward movie, many fights, no low pace, great production, and it checked all of it. So if you are a fan of Godzilla and Kong go watch it at cinema, and enjoy!",9
"More fun as I was expecting, less gritty.","Starts off again as ""a day in the life of Kong"" reality tv, just like in Godzilla vs Kong. I loved that. It didn't feel like it was made for imax at the start, then I just kinda got used to it. Didn't have that much depth, could notice this in close up scenes and parts of the screen looked blurry. Wish I'd seen it in RPX or a similar format for a more immersive experience.Kong is always lonely man, it was great to see him find new apes. Also how did that little monkey survived being slammed around and then being used as a batting stick by Kong lol.This movie had a distinctly video game-like quality, both in its graphics and the action sequences. A lot of green screen. However it was pretty fun, I especially enjoyed the fight in the desert. Also, I wanted Godzilla to lift his feet so bad when he was walking out of Italy. Back to the video game-y feel, like watching Godzilla run was cool, and Kong riding, but it was really video gamey to me. I saw a little of that in the trailers.It was giving me jumanji vibes. The stakes were really high, but the movie felt simply fun. It's arguably the most fun packed installment in the MonsterVerse yet. However, I wished it had retained a slightly darker, more serious tone akin to earlier Godzilla films. While Scar King was formidable, his jokes sometimes undercut the seriousness. The movie lacked the intimidating atmosphere that earlier Godzilla movies captured due to the overall fun vibe of the film.Like I always remember the scene where Godzilla finally showed up at the airport in Godzilla(2014) or when Rodan destroyed the city in King Of The Monsters, or the storm. This movie didn't have those vibes and I miss it. Still pretty fun, but instead of having my breath taken away I was just watching in this movie like ""oh that looks cool"" while laid back in my seat.Another thing not specific to this movie. Scenes like this always shock me, when they're in the jungle and the local tribe in camouflaged. Are these warriors just lurking, standing still in the bushes 24/7 waiting for a trespassers. It's not logical but almost always looks cool.The movie is quite ambitious, especially when it came to the Iwi tribe in hallow earth. There was so much lore and science added into the franchise. It was so compact and filled. I also like that the tribe spoke telepathically; Reminds me of the scene in Kong Skull Island when someone said they don't speak much.Certain scenes felt rushed, such as how quickly they obtained the mechanical arm. It did seem overly convenient and the movie could've benefited from more development. The overall pacing of the movie, with a rush to get to the big fight, gave it a sense of being hurried for me, almost like a speed run through mini-missions to get to this big fight. It felt as though they were hesitant to make the movie longer, and I wish it was extended it by 30 minutes could have allowed for more depth and nuance.I can't believe icy Godzilla just ended up being a lovely pet dog, and Godzilla is sleeping in Italy like a cat. Anyway, so many parts of the movie are great, the action, ambition, and overall fun vibe, making it highly enjoyable for many viewers. While I think it's good or kinda good, I do wish it were slightly longer and had a darker tone. It feels like a departure from the tone of earlier Godzilla films and seems to target a slightly different/broader audience. A lot of people seemed to like it, a lot of kids too. While it may not fully meet my expectations, it's still a movie worth watching for its entertainment value, I guess.",6
Not fun to watch,"Not sure how you can enjoy a movie like this if you are an adult. Anyway, the best thing here is maybe the actors. Rebecca Hall, Dan Stevens, Brian T Henry. The rest is awful. I am amazed that grown ups gather in a room to discuss a script and they come up with something that stupid. It is worse than the previous one, which was already terrible. There is no stake in the story. CGI keeps getting worse (Baby Kong). Compare it with what we were seeing 10-20 years ago or what Planet of the Apes was doing more recently and you know that they gave up investing in CGI. They try to fill the screen with more stuff, more monsters, more destructions. They should have respected the premise of the King Kong story, which is quite simple. That we might have forgotten animal species on this planet. Not a fantasy with some stupid hollow earth below our feet, with dinosaurs, monsters and magic. It is not fun to watch. It is an insult to our intelligence. Come on.",2
A Decent Watchable Monster Action Flick,"*** Godzilla * Kong : The New Empire Movie Review ***Directed by Adam Wingard the film is the sequel to Godzilla vs Kong.Plot of the Movie.This time Kong encounters a mightier enemy "" Skar King"" & he needs the help of Godzilla to put an end to Skar King's story.Will Kong be able to succeed?Analysis of the Movie...The movie initially starts with a slow pace but after some time a hint of something will happen is being generated. The first half goes into this curiosity.The second half is about unveiling the mystery of how the Skar King is connected to Godzilla and Kong.The screenplay journey will not make you happy to the fullest as after a certain point I was expecting a blow but no it takes us to the height of the patience and then it breaks. The last 15 minutes of power packed action blended with 3D specs gives us goosebumps, it's like the SRK & Salman come together for an action in Pathaan.From the technical aspect, the visualisation of the Hollow Earth, the habitation of Iwi Community in the Hollow Earth had been beautifully taken. It makes us believe that these are not fiction although we know its a Fictional Movie.BGM while entrance of Godzilla gives the audience a feel of anxiety as whether Godzilla is coming for war or for something else as its character journey had been portrayed respectively in the screenplay.The basic plot of the Movie is an Evil to conquer the Throne of Power will go to the extreme to fulfill but there are some fearless who turn that into just a dream.This plot we had seen in many movies in different versions but what makes this movie worth watching is how this concept they blend with the mythology of the protagonist characters which makes the audience convince able.",7
Barbizilla,"I'm entertained, but the movie is popcorn. WB is well-aware of what the audience wants - CGI monster fight scenes - and they give it in full. Storyline of the human characters are reduced to contextualizing and driving the narrative toward more titan face-offs. However, despite their little screen time, all actors gave convincing enough performances: Rebecca Hall a tender-hearted mother and Brian Tyree Henry a comedic normie who's not overly cringy. The plot of the monsters is pretty simple as well, but it's revealed gradually throughout the film either by human narration or physical language, which I think is a smart choice for a commercial production. However, too much screen time for titans makes me lose track of how big the creatures are, which is quite underwhelming for a movie about giant monsters - the production tries to make it up by using shaky cameras and earth-moving sound effect, but somewhere along the second act I just don't see Kong as large as he is in Skull Island. Finally, the action sequences are heavily budgeted: ax, spine whip, ice rays, Barbie rays, mechanical boxing glove, flying buildings, destruction of important cultural relics, and most satisfyingly, no human intervention. If you like how the Transformers smashed the pyramids to smithereens, you'll love this movie.",6
"Unfortunately, Godzilla and Kong do not kiss","I am honestly glad we are getting more movies in the Monsterverse. The movies have been amazing or anything but they have been thoroughly entertaining. After Godzilla vs Kong, we are getting a team-up movie with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. Does this continue to be entertaining, or is this finally the entry that bores you?You came to this movie for big monsters fighting and in this aspect, the movie succeeds. There are a great many fight scenes in this movie, especially with Kong. I love the way Kong fights and how you can clearly see how he is strategizing and planning compared to Godzilla's ferocious animalistic style. They also created a new villain for Kong with ""The Scar King"". I love the design of him and his more agile style of fighting. The movie builds up to an epic 3rd act brawl and it is insanely entertaining and worth watching for it alone.The CGI is pretty good considering that this is the cheapest MonsterVerse movie so far. Hollow Earth looks great and Kong looks phenomenal. Godzilla has a new pink design for story reasons and it looks fine. There are some visually great-looking shots by returning cinematographer, Ben Seresin, that capture the mystical nature of Hollow Earth and the Titans. Kong is the main lead in this film and he is the stand-out star. There are many scenes with just Kong and other apes that go on for 10 minutes long with no dialogue or humans and they work so well. Just through Kong's facial expression and body language, you can perfectly understand the emotion and the story that is being conveyed. It is impressive. In terms of human characters, Trapper played by Dan Stevens is a fun newcomer. He has excellent chemistry with returning character Bernie played by Brian Tyree Henry.Unfortunately, the story concerning the human characters is still incredibly dumb. There are many questionable and stupid things such as why they only brought one armed soldier for a mission or why even a conspiracy podcaster is even involved in the mission. The human characters are still not interesting or engaging enough to care about. They tried to incorporate the mother-and-daughter relationship plot element again with returning characters Dr. Ilene (Rebecca Hall) and Jia (Kaylee Hottle) but it doesn't work well because they don't explore it enough. For the most part, Ilene is again the exposition character. It's a shame as Godzilla Minus One shows that you can do big monsters and engaging human characters in a movie.The pacing drops off significantly around the second act where it just has a bunch of humans talking and exposition dumps. Additionally, Godzilla is barely in this movie despite being the first in the title. Every fight scene concerning Godzilla barely lasts a minute in the first 2 acts. It is understandable to show how powerful Godzilla is but it would have been nice to see the fights last a bit longer. On that note, while the fights are indeed entertaining, they are not as well choreographed as the ones in Godzilla vs Kong. Junkie XL returns to score the music for this movie but it definitely lacks the impact that Junkie usually does. The music score is a bit forgettable.Overall, I came to see giant monsters fight and I got exactly that. This feels like a very high-budget B movie and honestly, that is completely fine. Godzilla x Kong is another entertaining movie in the MonsterVerse and I hope more is made in this cinematic universe. The possibilities are endless!",6
Enough of the human drama no one cares,"Godzilla was made famous because it was so different and just a monster flick. So why in gods name does hollywood think we care to see reoccurring people from the previous films.I couldn't care less for the russel family or this tribal girl. You could legit have just news reports, the white house or political figures talking debating and monsters just fighting.Thinking these types of flicks need all this extra crap kills my interest quick. People may make fun of Michael Bays Transformers but at least majority of it was actually filled with the autobots fighting.Same with pacific rim I didn't like it a lot but its still more enjoyable than this.",1
Heading in the right direction,"I think this addition to the Godzilla x Kong I'm not going to spoil anything, but the way the monsters were and how they looked like a massive threat was absolutely flawless. Hence the reason for the headline I wrote heading in the right direction because obviously everyone knows that Godzilla and Kong partnered up as shown in the trailer. Do we really want to see the same movie over and over again the same monsters go toe to toe if you want that watch WWE lol. But this is a direction that they have obviously put time and effort in so hopefully we get another Godzilla and Kong movie, but hopefully Jack Black returns to the Kong universe even as a cameo role to sort of rekindle his time with Kong but only the future will tell. Loved this movie 👍🏼",8
Might not be the best monster-verse entry but definitely the most fun!,"A film about giant monsters fighting to the death was never going to be groundbreaking in terms of storytelling but nonetheless the Godzilla x Kong: A New Empire delivers exactly what fans have come to expect.It's visually impressive when it comes to the monster designs and its large scale action scenes. It's thrilling and there are some great references to Showa Era of the Godzilla franchise. However Godzilla himself is sidelined in this film and Kong once again seems to get more screen time. That being said, Kong is definitely the heart of the film and shines every time he's on screen. The human characters, script and the pacing are probably the weakest elements of the film. Dan Stevens and Brian Tree Henry are the best human characters since they bring a well needed comedic flair. It seems that the rest of the human characters are only really there to deliver clunky exposition that feels like it comes of nowhere and there are times the film is either very slow or going to fast. Like when it has time to breathe it suddenly picks up the speed again and I can barely have time to think.Overall, Godzilla x Kong is a flawed but very fun film that will please longtime fans but newcomers will be very confused or very uninterested.",7
DUMBZILLA X KONG,"Everyone involved in the making of this absolutely dreadful waste of time and money, should be thoroughly be ashamed of themselves. The writers should never be allowed to pen another draft of anything. Not even a text message or fill in a birthday card to their own parents.The executives who gave the go ahead should now only have the key to the janitors cupboard. The financiers shouldn't be allowed to have a bank account without guardianship. They obviously can not be trusted with money. As to the clowns who actually directed & put the whole thing on screen. You should need a McDonald's uniform for your next job.1/10.",1
Complete and Utter Nonsensical Brilliance,"Went watching this film this morning with my 9 year old son and wow did we enjoy it. We have watched all the recent Godzilla and Kong films and enjoyed then all, but this film knocks them all out of the park. Now I am not saying this is an Oscar winning classic or a film for everyone but for the genre, Monster v Monster action movie, this cannot be beaten.The action / fight scenes just don't stop throughout the entirety of the film. The Monsters Kong and Godzilla come up against throughout the film are all different each time meaning the film brings to life a wide variety of different species / titans for the duo to battle against. This means no one battle is the same and it is not the same two species fighting over and over again. Next, the story might be nonsensical but it keeps the movie moving throughout and it explains everything to keep all viewers in the loop. But let's be honest you don't go watching films like this one for the story, you go to be entertained and this film definitely does that.",10
What Walt's Watching,"When a kaiju movie opens with an exotic scene and the sub-title ""Somewhere in Middle Earth"" you instantly know you're back on King Kong's turf after they transported him from Skull Island in the last Kong movie to this wonderland underground on our planet.A place where sunshines inexplicably and lush jungles thrive with absolutely no photo-synthesis.Yes it's bad science, but we forgive them when they say, ""if middle earth exists what else don't we know about this planet?""
A lot it would seem, most of it needing no justification whatsoever.Unlike the previous film which concentrated on a few ""Stranger Things"" scenarios this one brings back plenty of Titans battling other titans and a few we've never met till now.(No spoilers here, just watch the trailer)It's been 3 years since ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" and in the meantime we've been forced to endure the TV series ""Monarch: Legacy of Monsters"", which was light on scary monsters and heavy on super creeps.Our old favourite nuclear fusion Titan ""Godzilla"" has a new design with purple/pink-colored plates similar to ""Godzilla Millennium"".Godzilla's atomic breath is now on volume eleven after a fight with another Titan that looked a hell of a lot like the one Kong fights in an earlier scene and both are aquatic, one fresh water, the other saltwater.In the new list of Titans is a mini Kong named ""Suko"" and he's a nasty piece of work initially, but learns to love the King like audiences have since the 1930's.In Japanese, it roughly translates to, ""Essential Child."" While Suko is also a Filipino word for ""surrender.""
Go figure?Meanwhile nice Kong is ageing well...growing out his beard and letting his hair down like a millennial hipster.By the time the next Kong comes out he'll have a man bun and be looking for love on MAFS.The release of ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" marks 10 years since this Godzilla universe hit the silver screen and it's also the 70th anniversary of the entire franchise.Even I wasn't alive when this cinematic adventure started.I find the problem with both Godzilla and King Kong in this era is they aren't the same terrifying monsters I grew up watching.Last years Japanese ""Godzilla Minus One"" restored the post WW2 terror narrative, but it's been lost again in the latest Hollywood blockbuster which has turned them into cuddly toys.Still the many Titans (not the Gold Coast NRL team) fight scenes are epic and the carnage they cause makes the structural damage from all the Marvel movies seem like petty cash.Poor Spider-Man and the Avengers have nothing to worry about compared to what happens in London, Rome & Rio, South America.For a moment there it was starting to sound like a David Bowie/Mick Jagger song about dancing in the street.Watch out for: The B. E. A. S. T. Or Bio Enhanced Antatomech Seismic Thunder.Fun Fact: The third Monsterverse film featuring Kong that filmed on the Gold Coast, in Australia, following ""Kong: Skull Island"" and ""Godzilla vs. Kong"".This is the first MonsterVerse film to be shot in IMAX and it looks and sounds amazing!Unfortunately the visual fx budget must have run low for some scenes that look like carry overs from 50's monster films while others are out of this world in detail.Monarch are back giving giant corporations a bad name in a universe that's ever expanding with more monsters and less human stories, so what's not to like about that.""The New Empire"" will be box office number one over the Easter School Holidays with director Adam Wingard proving a good choice to bring back on board this franchise for another 2 hours of terrific Titans.",7
Nonsensequel,"Expectations were relatively high after watching the trailers but came out unimpressed, despite all the ticks.Sure, it is a requirement that you suspend reality when watching a movie, especially when it's a syfy-fantasy. You just enjoy the action, the CG and the mayhem and destruction. This has all that in buckets but....... does it have to jump back and forth and plenty of feeding close-ups? Of course. Tick.But wait, what about the plot, the storyline. Meh!What sucks?Well, there's the lack of continuity, the timing and duration of events, the inconsistent scales of the titans from scene to scene and the amazing tidiness of the mini-stories to name a few. Tick, tick, tick.Then there's the neatness. Yep, it's all very neat. How? They need this, why here it is, and there's that and the other. Neatness tick.Anything is posible, of course.So, of course there are people living in the 'middle-earth' land of titans. Of course there are more apes. Of course you can trek back to your ship past man-eating plans, fly back to the surface, travel to where you just happen to have a giant prosthetic gauntlet for the injured Kong (and the correct hand), fly it back and fit it before Hutton finishes a sentence, and of course Kong will like and be able to use it in an instant. Why not? You suspended reality before taking your seat, remember? Big tick that.Time flies.Apart from the first few minutes, the storyline is set to 'ludicrous' speed and develops fast, really fast. Illogical, mind-boggling events and revelations cascade so quickly that the director knows the viewer will need help. Which is why half the dialog is about explaining WTF just happened. Tick and tick.Destructions galore.Where to titans like to fight? In populated cities of course, preferably where famous monuments can be flattened. Tick.Overall 4 stars, for all the ticks.",4
"""Is that a mini Kong?""","Before I get rolling here, I thought I'd mention the correct way to pronounce this movie's title. I was curious, because Godzilla x Kong sounds just too awkward, and since we already had ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" a few years ago, that wouldn't have made sense. So here it is: ""Godzilla Kong: The New Empire"". Warner Brothers says the 'x' is silent, so who is anyone to argue?Well, I don't know about anyone else, but this seemed like a giant excuse to have a huge monster slugfest. Once these guys get going, the action is relentless, especially in the latter part of the movie. The titled Titans get to mix it up at one point, but then, when
a threat from Hollow Earth emerges to threaten the entire planet, the behemoths team up to take down a serious handful of other giants with names like Tiamat, Shar King and Shimo, an ice powered monster that almost took the measure of Kong, who received a mechanical right arm to bolster its strength after Shimo hit him with its icy breath. That took a lot of Mentos, let me tell you. The amazing thing is that an adventurer/dentist called Trapper (Dan Stevens) conveniently had one of those huge exoskeleton arms just hanging around ready to be put to good use in case Kong needed it. Still, one would have to ask, what would have happened if Kong had his left arm injured instead? That could have been a problem.The titanic struggles are wrapped around a story involving some human counterparts and a lost Iwi tribe living in the bowels of Hollow Earth, but let's face it. That's not what you come to see the movie for. It's the epic action at the center of the story, and on that score, the film doesn't disappoint. As I said, it's virtually non-stop belligerent action from beginning to end, with both Kong and Godzilla making appearances in the very opening minutes of the story. As a monster free for all, it will leave fans breathless and clamoring for more if that were even possible.",7
G-Man's back!,"This was better than Godzilla vs Kong, that's for sure.We got to see more of the hollow earth species, such as Doug (the goodest boi), the eel thing and shimo. Some titans returning from king of the monsters such as Scylla and Mothra (who didn't die this time :]) as well!One nit-pick I do have with the film though, is the unexplained disappearance of Mark and Madison. Sure, they're pretty minor characters at this point, but Bernie was included in this film, and Mark was working to find out why Godzilla was seemingly randomly attacking cities in Godzilla vs Kong, so wouldn't he be working to find out why he was consuming energy from nuclear power plants? I'm not saying they would have been needed in the story, though maybe a reference to them would have been nice.Overall a great adrenaline rush film and nice to encounter more species!",
Godzilla x Kong a kaijue sized load of fun,"Godzilla x Kong the new empire made me want to go back to the theaters to go and see a movie all the marketing and all the trailers compelled me to go see this and after watching it a second time in theaters I can say this movie was exactly as it was marketed a movie full of action and full of fun. While the complaints about human characters this movie handled them really well and in fact had in my opinion the best human character in this entire series, but the main focus is still on the monsters mostly Kong still but Godzilla really has his time to shine and this movie wasn't afraid to go back to those older era of Godzilla films having this be a fun goofy ride of a movie.",7
Brace yourselves for epic battles between colossal monsters...!!!,"What truly sets this film apart is the emotional connection that is established with both Godzilla and Kong. You will find yourself rooting for both creatures at different points in the film, making the final battle even more intense and emotionally satisfying...The special effects are top-notch, with both Godzilla and Kong looking incredibly realistic and intimidating. The fight sequences are epic and well choreographed, showcasing the full extent of each monster's powers...Director Adam wingard deserves praise for his expert direction, keeping the pace brisk yet allowing for quieter, character-driven moments to shine. The score complements the action beautifully, heightening the tension and emotion throughout...The film from start to finish is a rollercoaster with nonstop action. The light-hearted and comic-book-like portrayal of characters makes the movie appeal to a broader audience without having to catch up with every entry in the series so far...However, the human characters take a backseat in this Titan-centric tale, and the plot can feel a bit thin at times. But who the hell needs a complex narrative when you've got Kong and Godzilla trading earth-shattering blows? The film's focus on the titans' origins and their bond with humankind adds a layer of depth, but it might leave some viewers longing for more...",6
😂 It Gets a 1 Outta 10 For the Godzilla/King Kong Suplex off The Top Rope 😂,"Just Got out of a Dolby Cinema Screening of Godzilla X Kong Screening.Man, that was not Very Good At All. Boring as Hell. Where is the Gravitas by the Characters from Previous Films in this? Now, all of a Sudden, everything is a Damn Joke Now? Also the Plotline, there was way too damn much going on and this Film has Completely Inferior Visuals compared to the Previous Entries.👎 Godzilla X Kong is in my opinion nowhere near the other Legendary Films, Specifically Godzilla Vs Kong or Godzilla King of the Monsters(KOTH is just Very Slightly Behind GVK, I loved KOTM, but GVK was Such an Experience).👎 The Visuals in this Film at almost 100% of the Time, were not Eye Popping or Amazing at All, Absolutely Terrible Compared to, Godzilla 2014, Kong Skull Island, and Nowhere Near KOTH and GVK.(The Suplex looked Great though 😂)👎 Also, I remember feeling the Power of Godzillas Charge Up Atomic Blast in Godzilla King of the Monsters. Where was that Energy in this? It wasn't the Same Amazing Charge Up, and Godzilla Supposedly had even More Power with the Pink Atomic Blast. Where was the Power Flying Across the Auditorium? It was Underwhelming as Hell.👎 Then on to the Plotlines, there was way too damn much going on, one of the Plotlines was Like Kong Skull Island ........but on Steroids.👂🎵 Another thing, the Score and Music, I liked it very much but it's used so badly in the Film, it's just sort of like Background Noise instead of Elevating what's Happening on screen.🤷 Also, Brian Tyree Henry has a couple of Laughs but he was Very Underwhelming here. He was Absolutely Hilarious in Godzilla Vs Kong. Very Disappointing, although Dan Stevens and He have this Particular Joke together that was Funny though 😂.🙋Rebecca Hall was Ok.🤦🏻 And then you had all this other Stuff Going on just To get 2 Crappy other Monsters on Screen. After Seeing the Titan Mecha Godzilla and Ghidorah from the 2 Previous Entries. D'you think we can go back to 2 Underwhelming Monsters like these?👎 Also, the other Plotline with Kong and the mini Kong, it was crap in my opinion, it just wasn't good.🤷 Another thing, where is the Gravitas from Godzilla King of Monsters Concerning these World Ending Monsters? Godzilla Vs Kong, Godzilla King of The Monsters and Godzilla Minus one all were Terrified of these Monsters. Now the characters look at them like they're little Puppies or Something, Good God.What the Hell were they Thinking?The Only Positives I can Give this Film are -1. The Score and Music(although used very Poorly in my opinion)2. The Suplex off the Top Rope.That's it, there's Nothing Else Good about the Film.Overall, this is a 1 Outta 10 at Very Best. Just be Glad we've Watched Godzilla Vs Kong, Godzilla Minus One, And Godzilla King of the Monsters in Dolby/and or IMAX. The 3 Greatest Entries in my Opinion.",1
This movie was absolute insanity!!! And I loved it!!!!,"I watched this move with 5 other people and we all absolutely loved it. The monster fights were absolute insanity and gave me goosebumps every time. The movie gave me a somewhat 80's vibe because of the coloration and soundtrack. And the acting was quite good, the chemistry between Brian-tyree-Henry and Dan Steven was phenomenal and the duo made me laugh every time and there were so many moments in that movie that amazed me. And instead of completely focusing around the humans it mostly focused around the titans and the story of scar king and the great ape army. This movie was a solid 10 out of 10 and I highly recommend you watch this. This is easily one of the best monster-verse movies they have made so far. And just a quick note don't listen to the people who gave the movie a low score. Their are few of them but they just don't enjoy life for what it is and they are generally hard to please. Glad there will be more MonsterVerse movies.",10
It's Simple Fun,"The movie is quite fun overall.Negatives:
The dialogue delivery left much to be desired. Sometimes it was too cheesy and I cringed. I like having people feature heavily in these movies bc it'd be difficult to relate to a bunch of monsters destroying stuff on their own, but the interactions felt disjointed. The science was pretty bad in this movie, and the protagonist would just blurt hypothesis with zero proof on screen lol exposition isn't always the best.Positives:
Beautiful color palette, a lot of the effects were very cool. The titans all looked pretty great, both design and CGI wise! The different specie designs were also pretty cool. The fights were good of course, and engaging! I loved the young ape.",6
There is so much wrong with this film,"In a nut shell, i feel like I lost s few brain cells watching this and only gave a generous score of 5 to be kind to the people who worked on this hot mess. Spoilers after this.Between the Golom Baby Ape, to highly inteligent animals, and magically repairing Roman Colussium, random alternating scaling of creatures, there is so much that the massive fights couldn't hide. One cant help think how the creatures always end up fighting or just getting by destroying around famous land marks,... Bridges, monuments, the pyramids.... But suddenly in Brazil they avoid the Christ Statue. Guess the editors figured destroying that land mark would be too offensive. There is so much but I wont go on anymore. People put their seat and blood into this I am sure, and the studio i understand is making some money on this mindless entertainment... I Just cant get my mind off of the human body count in all the destroyed cities.",5
Best Monsterverse Movie Released,"I have no words for how IMMACULATE this movie was. My expectations were high at first, and they really delivered.Adam Wingard really did good this time. GxK was such an amazing film to watch and I'd definitely watch it over and over again, without getting bored. I have high hopes that this film will surpass the box office goal.The CGI was great, humans decent, writing decent, VFX/SFX/GFX all great, all the new kaijus were great (sad scylla and tiamat got killed off). The story was rather, interesting... But I loved it all.Overall, this film was spectacular. I can't wait to see what will happen in the future!Long live the Monsterverse.",10
Won't Win Awards But If You Love Popcorn Movies!,"Godzilla has been around over for years and years even since movies have been made and really even if it doesn't win any awards. Then if you love popcorn movies, then this movie is for you.Sure the dialogue is corny but the acting does save the movie as the actors and actresses on what they are given here. But that it is due to the fast paced action that makes up for a pretty messed up script and plot.Brian Tyree Henry an underrated and great character actor steals the movie away. Having comic relief and also keeps the action going with his wit and charm as a podcast host. Still he would be the reason to going and seeing it.",7
Minus A Whole Bunch,"Normally, when a so-so sequel comes out, it generally makes me want to go home and watch one of the better entries. This one just caused me to want to revisit any of the Godzilla films featured on MST3k.I swear, these MonsterVerse films get more progressively dumb as they proceed. Okay, they're dumb-fun, just...not *that* much fun anymore.Excluding entry #2, Kong: Skull Island and the 2023 fantastic Apple TV series, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, each chapter sinks deeper and deeper into the Middle Earth of realism. They might as well just animate these movies since they're so far from reality and the stakes couldn't be lower.Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire begs you to leave your brain at the door. Basically, there's a new (old?) threat to both of the title characters and the bad boys, bad boys, what are they gonna do? All-but high-five and fight. Duh.I wouldn't go as far to say this movie's bad...IF you don't take it seriously for one minute. It's also not a so-bad-it's-good. It's just there for those who want to see big monsters fight.Admittedly, my expectations couldn't be lower, namely when Baby Kong showed up in the trailers and he looked like he crawled right out of a Super Nintendo. (Spoiler: his graphics didn't improve in the final product and BY FAR was the worst CGI in the entire franchise.) So, the movie could literally go only up from what I predicted. And it did.Mostly ANY Kong scene was worthy of a watch. And mind you, NOT when any human did something to him - I only mean when he was away from all humans and on his own adventures.Funny, I grew up on Godzilla movies and loved them as a kid. I couldn't get enough and while I respected King Kong and loved his three standalone movies (from 1933, 1976 and 2005, forgetting all the other ""sequels/crossovers,"") Godzilla was my jam. In this MonsterVerse, it's the opposite. Kong is definitely King throughout.Luckily, I was able to separate my recent LOVE and AWE for Godzilla Minus One when I watched this latest King of the Monsters film. Yes, they're from separate universes, but comparing them is like asking which is better: Bram Stoker's Dracula and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter or Bride of Frankenstein and I, Frankenstein. You know one's great and the other silly.While this ranks dead-last in the MonsterVerse (see below,) it's still worthy of a watch. It's harmless and may even develop into a drinking game every time you have to say to yourself: ""Yeah, right"" or ""Really? Seriously?""***Final Thoughts: My MonsterVerse Ranking:1. Kong: Skull Island (2017)
2. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters (2023)
3. Godzilla (2014)
4. Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)
5. Godzilla vs. Kong (2021)
6. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (2024)",4
CGI is going up but IQ level going down.,"The more they increase these monsters' intelligence the more they insult the intelligence of adult human audiences. Keep the middle way. Make it neither childish nor too complex. This one was leaned more towards childish level. Don't get me wrong, I loved the actions and alliances but I believe the writers can do better than that in setting up the ways they achieve alliances between certain monsters.My personal MonsterVerse Rating:
Godzilla 2014 (7/10) (Worthy Godzilla reboot)
Kong: Skull Island 2017 (7/10) (Worthy Kong reboot)
Godzilla: King of Monsters 2019 (7/10) (Great villain monster)
Godzilla vs Kong 2021 (6/10) (unfortunately, the start of of too much fantasy, the way the monster skull possessing the mech suit Megagodzilla, come on)
Godzilla x Kong.: The New Empire 2024 (6/10) (too humanlike interaction between monsters, too much fantasy, but great action scenes)",6
on par with Thor: Love and Thunder..,"This is my first ever review here. So, bear with me. I'm gonna try and keep it short.First of at all... Even the very beginning of the movie was like a blurry mess. I'm sure they're pretty talented people but looks like the VFX team who worked on this project forced to shorten their rendering times. Even at the very start of the movie, CGI is bad, and nothing near the past Godzilla and Kong movies from the Hollywood. Could've been much much better than this. This one is the least watchable when compared with the others, I don't think I'll ever re-watch it again. Not enough lively details with the CGI, not looking realistic enough. Also, the bigness of the characters doesn't feel majestic enough on their surroundings. Something doesn't right about their proportions and movements as well.Right until seeing this movie I was like, Hollywood is absolutely doing Godzilla movies better than the Japan. Since I liked the Godzilla (2014) more than the Godzilla Minus One (2023). But oh boy, I got sucker punched good with this one.Oh! And also... Lot's of irrelevant 80's music and neon colors all over the movie. I mean, guys! Please! It wasn't like this even with the ones with Millie Bobby Brown present with her Stranger Things background =) This is pretty much why I decided to write Thor: Love and Thunder on the headline of my review btw. That one also was over-colorful just like this one, and also fell down the expectations.My 2 cents...Story was not that bad, somehow acceptable. But it's practice was done wrong at times. Needs some re-writes, re-shoots and re-renders to be GOLDEN.It's not a bad ""one time"" watch if you're able to trick your brain into re-imagining what you're seeing at the exact moment of you're seeing it, and fill the gaps with your imagination =)
I mean if you can accept how the CGI looks, and if you're also into 80's music and neon colors like I do.I don't think this qualify as a spoiler since it can be clearly seen on the poster but... If you're sensitive and not even checked out the poster yet, please stop reading right around here.It was sad to see that the King is Pink. Maybe they could've gone with the Red instead. You know, since no monster is scary in Pink.Felt like I'm watching an ad... A beverage ad... Dragon Fruit flavored... An energy drink brand's =)And It was more of a Kong movie than the Godzilla x Kong. They should've named it ""Mostly Kong x Partly Godzilla"" and not even write the Godzilla first.Thank you. You read it all.That sure shows character !You are a Red Godzilla !!RAWR !!..",6
Satisfying in a way,"All this Kong thing I think is about time the end game comes, like there's no threat real enough to even call forth the formidable Godzilla even when it's a tag team battle, if they continue in this direction eventually it would result in a flop and that could be catastrophic for even we the fans, scenes that took my breath away were included and that's amazing but i bet so many have had enoughof this Godzilla and kong thing, don't get me started on the fact that a kung fu fighting monkey or gorilla took form in arms in a whip that he uses i mean who taught him how to fight like that, coming from humble beginnings you can tell the story evolved but now it's heading somewhere different, great entertainment though but other than that ehh nothing Comes to mind.",6
Massive disappointment,"To start my review: yes, I have seen all of the previous movies leading up to this piece of s***.And yes I have enjoyed those previous films.This movie, is a letdown on multiple fronts.I'm just going to sum it up in bulletpoints no need to write too much to make my point.it tries to be funny, but fails miserably to land any joke or pun.cgi is sloppy. When you have too much monsters that means too much cgi. Which means budget has to be divided.Result: fake looking action.the actions scenes are not involving at all. Looks stupid, does not take you into it.when huge monsters as kong or Godzilla roar, you don't hear anything. Yet when they walk the sounds trembles enormously. Reason; the music on these moments is waaaay to loud.it is just dumb, so dumb.You can get away with it when all of the above points are no issue. When they are, the movie fails.Which it did.Really disappointing.",2
Another Great Addition to Monarch but not as great as it looks.,"""Godzilla vs. Kong"" starts off strong with an engaging first half that really pulls you into the story. However, some might find the pacing a bit slow at times, especially in the buildup to the action scenes. Speaking of action, the battles between Godzilla and Kong are jaw-dropping, especially in the first half. But as the movie progresses, it feels like there's something missing in terms of the story's substance. And unfortunately, the climax didn't quite deliver the epic finale that many were hoping for. Overall, it's a fun movie to watch once, especially if you're a fan of monster flicks, but it might not have enough depth to keep you coming back for more.",8
ALOT of suspension of belief needed....,"My 12 year old son likes these movies and comics, so he's been excited to see it.I was looking forward to it aswell... until I started seeing the bad reviews etc.Well what can I say, yes it UTTERLY ridiculous, all over the place, plot holes central.BUT... its a movie about giant ancient creatures and worlds under ours. So come on?Go in with an open mind and forget the absurdity... and the convenient bionic arm that happens to be a flying ship that CAN ALSO cure frost bite.. hmm ha.Also, the main villain I actually did find the scenes there pretty scary and dark. Very planet of the apes in tone... but obviously not as good.My son loved it, and we had a good laugh about it afterwards, enjoyable.",7
"Wow, it's a mini Kong","This new entry into the Monsterverse saga delves further into the histories of Godzilla and Kong, their origins, and the mysteries of Skull Island and beyond.And let's not forget that the film also tries uncover the mythic battle that helped forge these extraordinary beings, and what tied them to humankind forever.I always want to give the Monsterverse the benefit of the doubt, because they brought about a new cinematic universe without telling anybody about it.But unfortunately, the quality of the films have been steadily dropping, and this has to be the worst of the franchise, and i'm astounded by all of the positive reviews and box office that this has received.Yes, the effects are amazing. And that's the only positive thing I have to say about this. The film makes no sense, and whatever story this film pretends to have, it gets lost in a sea of CGI and battles.The battles are boring, and amount to nothing, and the human cast are given nothing to do, aside from going to location after location and spouting out exposition to keep reminding the audience that this is supposed to have some sort of narrative flow.But it's going to have a sequel, and I really hope that one is better than this.A dud.",3
Epic visual treat,Trust me the best monsterverse movie .The director exactly knew what audience were paying for and it was brilliantly executed. The humans tale less screentime than the monsters and the entry of Martha was epic .The fights which we all anticipated and the team up of Godzilla and kong against scar King and shimu is meant to be watched in the biggest screen possible. Go for the movie rather waiting for ott you will definitely regret for not watching in a big screen.The director exactly knew what audience were paying for and it was brilliantly executed.

Attractive and spectacular,"""Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire"" is the latest film in the Monsterverse cinematic world, which is a continuation of the previous film, where Godzilla and Kong work together to destroy a very large threat.So far, 122 reviews have been published on the website Rotten Tomatoes for the movie ""Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire"", giving it a score of 56%. On the Metacritic site, out of 42 reviews published for this film, a score of 48 out of 100 has been recorded for it.But it is not a small compliment if we say that the movie ""Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire"" is a skillful and fascinating work.",7
A total waste of money,"The show is utterly nonsensical. Wasted my entire 120 mins or so.. a show with hardly a storyline to begin with. 3 parts which I can share.. (sorry, spoiler alert but I'm gonna save you some money and you are gonna thank me) 1st, a mechanical arm which was pre-made. How the heaven did they predict that Kong will be frostbite his right arm? 2, the show is also telling you that there are multiple titans leaving here and there.. and Godzilla only killed them when he sensed a signal?? 3rd, the show is trying to tell you that there are iwi tribe leaving in the hollow world for god knows how long and no one found out.. and out of a sudden.. all those monkeys suddenly storming into it?",1
"""Lucky for us.. the prototype had already been transported to Hollow Earth for testing""","I for one appreciate the script on this one (or a lack of)! But still glad I didn't watch this on theaters.The constant ""Primal Rage"" battles with over the top cinematics and relentless action, and (more importantly) a small little human moment, while maintaining little presence throughout the film! There's so little dialogue, you could choose random points in the movie with a high probability of ""no one talking""!! They ALMOST got it perfectly this time, too.. buy there's always that one out-of-place character that feels annoying and distracting.And sadly, it still require you to shut-off your brain, as almost everything that happens is so too disconnected from reality and lacking in logical explanations. But this is a Monster Mash, and it does so very well! You can leave the more human and scientific storytelling to TOHO, whom are perfectly content with telling the same story as many times as possible. Fun and it moves rather fast, so it is easy to watch! And the great CGI helps too.",6
Godzilla x Kong,"These Godzilla and King Kong movies always get a mixed reaction out of me, on the one hand of this movie feels like a quick monster movie that you can watch with anybody, on the other hand this felt like a wasted potential regarding the premise of this movie and for my recent watching of Godzilla minus one. Imma a just be a mixed bag with this movie. The visuals are actually pretty nice and pretty dope to look at especially when you look at the monsters there are some scenes with Kong that feels like you can see the CGI but on the other hand on Godzilla, and on the other monkeys, it actually looks pretty damn cool, one thing that actually irritated me was the human plot line, now you can do humans really well just like Godzilla mine is one, but in this movie kind of feels generic there's always a group of people that kinda don't make sense to be around except for the little girl and the mother, other than that there are other people that don't have no personal motivations especially The funny one, and the one character that fixed Kong tooth they don't have real motivations or real personal goals that they want to achieve and that's another waste of potential in my opinion the villain scar king, he was pretty cool, but I feel like it's a little step down because in Godzilla versus King Kong they're actually cool personal motivations regarding the corporation of mega Godzilla and why they want to replace Godzilla but scar king in my opinion does not have any personal motivation or no point of view that we as an audience can look through, The certain story elements was kind of intriguing like Kong and the underworld. I forgot what name they called it, but that was wasted potential to me because they could've went somewhere with Kong being alone and being the only one, but it's revealed that he's not the only one he has to deal with trying to become king and another thing that kind of bother me was Godzilla. The reason Godzilla bother me was because we barely got to see Godzilla and Godzilla and King Kong movie. In my opinion. Godzilla was the highlight of the show because he was jumping body, slamming and doing all sorts of stuff king Kong was cool but you have to be equal if their characters names in the title Overall, this is a mixed reaction. It was not bad, it's not kind of good but it's just not to the point where made as in a bad movie but as mid as in action just to pass the time, but this movie was not bad at all 6.5/10.",6
Fun monster movie you'll forget five seconds after leaving the cinema,"Godzilla x Kong is good fun. No where near being as good as Godzilla Minus One, but better then I remember Godzilla vs Kong being.All the human characters I don't remember from the previous films, and won't remember again from this, exist either to read exposition off a wall, or deliver exposition they couldn't possibly know, in order to explain why the big monsters are kicking seven kinds of ahem out of each other. One is there to give us a bit of mystical woo woo, and why not.Kong is basically the star of the movie, which is how it should be. Most of the action is well done, and whilst there are bits where the cgi is a bit, well cgi, mostly it's good, and there are some truly stunning visuals. The big battle at the end with lots of monsters smashing seven bells out of each other is a bit all over the place, so you often can't tell who's biting who, but, hey we've all had nights like that.Far from essential, but you could do worse on a cold bank holiday afternoon.",6
"At this point, no new Godzilla movie can be topped after Godzilla Minus One.","Sure, the special effects, sound designs, camerawork, and thrills are there and there are some good visual spectacles and fights that are well-executed. The performances from the cast members are solid as well. However, I found myself just feeling that the story, action, concepts and the characters not being interesting or as creativity as it thinks and just like the American Godzilla movies (except 2014 one), they really miss the point of what makes Godzilla special.Adam Wingard is a talented director but his direction just continues to disappoint and disappoint, the characters are dull including some really laughably dialogue, and the pacing is pretty off. Some of the action moments are okay but that's about it and at times, it was a bit boring. Making a Godzilla movie boring should be a crime against humanity.",4
Entertaining,"A very beautiful looking movie with fantastic action sequences. Im amazed, everyone looks amazing, Kong, Baby kong, Godzilla and the evil monkey.The humans like always are kinda boring, a mute girl a otaku, the typical short hair girl and some kind of Animal Dentist, the girl and the vet are an ex couple, nobody cares about that to be honestThe final fight it's incredible, everything else it's generic, so that's everything i have to say, there is cameo but im not ruining the surprise for you, overall that's all, happy thanksgiving everyone, goodbay and good night. Watch this movie, guys, just watch it ok.",6
Awful,"I'll get right to the point. This is the 2nd worst Godzilla flic since Godzilla 1985. As usual, Legendary manages to make even the charactors/actors with the greatest potential and in their usual fashion, turns them into cardboad. Not even the semi-clever quips work to give these characters a heart. Kaylee Hottle is very talented and the poor script manages to snuff out her true potential. Same for Dan Stevens who has the potential to do great things but again, the script is so trite he is lost in the murk. The other cast members did a phone-in ""performance"" that a high schooler could have done.....maybe even better. As far as the CGI: over utilized and a quality that pales in comparison to Minus 1. Kong and Mini-Kong had rediculous facial expressions and the fight scenes between them looked like WWW wrestling match with all the correographed moves. If it wasn't so rediculous and disappointing, it would be hilarious. In Fact; audience was actually laughing at times. Legendary; you can't seem to do justice to these iconic charactors because the people you use to write, direct and produce don't understand them, so please stop trying. Dan Stevens: you have done great work in the past, please don't sell out to this garbage.",1
Ignore the weak reviews from these peasants.,"This was a great movie.. im baffled by all the low ratings. Perhaps people thought this was where self assessments are posted? Graphics were good, adventure good, story line for character development good, fight scenes were good, and music score good. I personally like the emotional and facial expressions expressed with kong and the other monkies .. perhaps this is where other people got lost.If you are still reading after this just know that it is ""cheap filler"" as you have to type at least 600 words to leave a review. So anyway, don't believe the tasteless naysayers this movie was dope!!!!",10
"I very rarely give a film 10, but... WOW!","Was it Godfather-level 10/10? No. Was I grinning like an idiot, saying ""Wow!"" out loud and fist-bumping my son throughout? YES! This is what I expect for my money- a literal bang for my buck.SPOILERS OBVIOUSLYStuff I liked off the top of my head:-Mini Kong was weird and creepy in the beginning, but I grew to love him. I couldn't believe Kong used him as a weapon!-the fight in Egypt was incredible (poor pyramids)! The one in Brazil was almost as good.-the multiple locations around the world made it feel like a Bond movie.-I liked all the human characters, especially the grumpy (Scottish?) pilot and Bernie Hayes. The girl- Jia- was good as always.-the fights were pretty brutal, starting from the first minutes of the movie.-there are long sections of the movie where titans and other creatures are communicating without words but you understand everything they're ""saying."" Often reminded me of a Planet of the Apes movie.-the music was spot-on and rocked throughout.-not too many ""talky,"" exposition scenes.-this movie does ice threat well (which Ghostbusters Frozen Empire didn't quite manage).-MOTHRA!!! (my favourite titan)Didn't like:-there must be thousands or hundred of thousands of people dead in Rio after the rampage there! R. I. P.Overall, VERY happy to have seen this! Definitely catch it in theatres (although I had to stand up and tell some douchebag a few rows down from me to stop filming the movie on her phone).",
It is entertaing,"Firstly, please refrain from comparing this to the Japanese release of Godzilla the same year. While I also enjoyed that film, this side of the Pacific Ocean offers a completely different experience.Now, let's dive into the review.The storyline back in the days was quite simple: a blonde ventures into a jungle where a giant gorilla falls in love. The climax involves the gorilla climbing a tall building in the city before meeting his death.Then, out of nowhere, Godzilla emerges, with a theory suggesting he was sleeping in an oceanic space. Subsequently, other monsters surface, all nourished by nuclear energy, leading to the expected chain of events.A new twist arises with the discovery of another jungle during World War II, revealing the existence of the colossal Kong. As the plot unfolds, we learn that the deep ocean isn't the only habitat for these creatures; there are hidden portals and even a whole Earth within Earth.Moving forward, the film delves into the Hollow Earth theory, unveiling yet another layer of secrecy within this subterranean realm. To uncover the details of this hidden place, you'll have to watch the movie.In an unexpected turn, Godzilla adopts a seemingly invincible persona to confront a formidable adversary, while Kong, who I suspect might start conversing in the next installment, receives an Iron Man-like upgrade.Ultimately, the movie is pure entertainment. Despite any negative criticism, it keeps you engaged throughout, ensuring you won't be bored. So, give it a watch, and the above will all make sense.",6
"Should be Called: ""Kong: Minus Godzilla""","If you want to see an empire fall, keep making potentially epic movies like Godzilla x Kong into silly drivel.As a big fan of 2014's Godzilla, I'm quite disappointed with this latest MonsterVerse installment. I'm angry at the direction they went with this movie. It's gone the way of too many franchises such as Fast & Furious and Transformers where the filmmakers have stopped taking it seriously. I'd rather they just not make the movie than make a joke out of it. It's such a trivial, forgettable, cheesy experience. The New Empire has the tone and style of a kids movie. The characters are silly and shallow, the sets look cheap, the CGI is mediocre, and most of the humor falls well below the intellectual level of an adult. It can't even be called good escapism because so much about it is unconvincing.If nothing else, this should have been visually thrilling. Rather, the monster fight sequences look like something on the level of those corny Power Rangers shows I watched growing up. It's so chaotic and looks so fake! The directer clearly had no idea what people want to see from such a movie. I remember watching 2014's Godzilla and getting goosebumps as they so expertly portrayed the power and scale of Godzilla. Not once during The New Empire did I think, ""These creatures look awesome!"" I wanted to feel overwhelmed by their presence, but the filmmakers paid no mind to that. They might as well have been human sized creatures fighting each other.It terms of story, they tried to do way to much. It got to the point where it felt like they were throwing something new in every 5 minutes. This is definitely an example of quantity over quality. Even if the runtime were as long as Peter Jackson's King Kong from 2005, it wouldn't have been long enough to make all of this work.One of the biggest crimes this movie commits, is it makes Godzilla an unnecessary character. I love Godzilla, but here he's a side character who's only in the movie to get more viewers to the theater. The New Empire would have been much better if it cut out all the other kaiju and focused on Kong and the primary ape villain who ends up getting a much smaller role than expected.I'm someone who has a soft spot for family-friendly adventure/fantasy films, and I couldn't even get with this movie. While most of it is watchable, the ridiculousness of the last act completely turned me off.",4
"Wow, this is one crazy movie","""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is one crazy movie. I mean, it's completely off-the-wall. The things that go on in this movie have to be seen to be believed. Don't try to guess what will happen next while watching this movie. It just keeps throwing one more outlandish development after another. That said, when the monsters are fighting ""The New Empire"" is great stuff. The monsters are hard to resist. As far as the human cast goes, they have a very hard job competing. The standout of this movie, as far as the humans go, is Brian Tyree Henry. ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" isn't my favorite movie of the series but I enjoyed the craziness. (I saw this at AMC Roosevelt Field, NY.)",7
Gigantic Smackdown: Godzilla vs. Kong - The Empire Strikes Out,"Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire reignites the age-old clash of titans, yet this battle feels more like a tired repetition than a fresh evolution. We're thrust into a world where Godzilla and Kong begrudgingly team up to safeguard humanity from lurking threats. However, whispers of an imminent danger soon shatter this fragile alliance, plunging our ape and atomic behemoth into a struggle for survival.The film's standout feature lies in its stunning visual spectacle. The epic clashes between Godzilla and Kong are nothing short of awe-inspiring. Director Adam Wingard orchestrates these confrontations with a frenzied vigor, whisking us from the neon-lit streets of Hong Kong to the gravity-defying depths of Hollow Earth. The visual effects are impeccable, meticulously crafting both monsters with breathtaking detail. Godzilla's atomic fury illuminates the screen, while Kong maneuvers with a graceful agility that defies his colossal stature.Yet, despite the visual splendor, the film falters in its storytelling. The narrative feels pieced together, relying heavily on tired tropes and predictable plot twists. Once again, human characters are relegated to mere bystanders in the monster spectacle, given scant development or depth. Although attempts are made to forge a bond between Kong and a newfound ape ally in Hollow Earth, it feels shallow and inconsequential. Moreover, lackluster dialogue and clichéd motivations do little to engage viewers in their plight.The pacing exacerbates the film's shortcomings, oscillating between sluggish exposition and frenetic action sequences. At times, the editing feels disjointed, marring the clarity of the fight choreography. While Tom Holkenborg's score delivers some adrenaline-pumping tracks for the battles, it lacks the thematic resonance or memorable melodies that elevate a monster movie.In essence, Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire falls short of its potential. While it may offer fleeting enjoyment for Kaiju enthusiasts craving big-budget showdowns, it ultimately disappoints with its forgettable narrative, underdeveloped characters, and uneven execution. For those seeking a monster movie masterpiece, this iteration is best left stranded on Skull Island.",6
Very Decent [7.5/10],"My Live Reaction / Review for Godzilla X Kong : The New Empire (2024): Kong has a cool new weapon. There must be a new threat. At first I thought what a cute small monkey but then it attacked Kong. Who are these monkeys, they got a trap for Kong, that's not good. Hollow Earth looks beautiful. Is it me or the movie focuses too much on people? I don't like that. Kong and the aggressive little monkey became friends? I didn't see that coming. It took them one hour to find the main villain, that's a bit late. Skar King vs Kong, let's go! What is this huge monster? It looks like Godzilla but it is not Godzilla, pretty cool. Skar King sent his apes to kill Kong, cant he do it himself? What a coward. Kong with his new mechanical hand looks badass. Mothra and Kong and Godzilla vs Skar King and Shimo, this is good. The last fight scene was pretty satisfying. Ok, overall the movie is not bad but also it isnt great, my rating is 7.5/10.",7
Who comes up with a story like this?,"The completely exagerrated human behaviour of Kong and that little monkey alone, so that even the dumbest viewer can follow this nonsense, is embarrasing. Not to forget the non-performance of all human actors (including the wild tribe inside of hollow, hollow earth). Why not just make the movie without any of them? It could'nt have done any harm. Then the titans woudl have even more time to fight their royal rumble. Nice wrestling move from Godzila to Kong at the pyramids by the way. The crowning glory, project powerhouse. Of course exactly for the arm, that poor Kong has injured. And of course stored in the outpost nearby. Lord, let it rain brains.",3
Good story plus amazing vrx,"Amazing imax 3d experience powerful vrx.good story line, movie never slow down.both characters kong and godzilla were amazing , action was at its best plus other characters from previous movie and continuity keep going but one thing -- too much violence if you are planning to go with your younger kids but i think it is entertaining for them too in a big way.but if you have watched part one or read the story it will be little help too.this movie is made for imax experience so best to watch in imax theatre and in 3d movie direction production everything is upto mark.and all the actors performed well enjoy the show cheers.",10
dull and dumber...,"It is when you make further equations of kong and now also godzilla et co, and some other new raising creatures, and of course the dumbest of them all is in my opinion, in this complete fantasy world, green screen and bluescreen produced movie, the HUMANS, what a horrible script, what a horrible cast, and what a horrible work from the cast, except maybe dan stevens, its just terrifying to have to watch a grand cast doing so little in a sophisticatedly horrendously baldly scripted movie, that an average grumpy old norwegian man has to pay almost 200 nok to watch at the movietheater , getting my, from before, blasted ears reblasted by the soundlevel and effects... no no, use your sparetime in fresh air and study life around you, its better than this... let them HUMANS out of the play at next productionpoint, they make me feel dum !!!",6
Please no more Brian Tyree Henry,"I feel like we've reached a point in the monsterverse where writers just gave up on pretending there's some story with the movies and just embraced the low-quality CGI bonanza that has increasingly dominated the series. Yet they still manage to introduce one of the most bizarre, senseless and irrelevant cast of characters, with no background story, no personality, no nothing. And for how long will Brian Tyree Henry, always doing his best version of Brian Tyree Henry, spoil every single random movie? So incredibly annoying and unnecessary, not funny at all and just... also what's going on with the out-of-nowhere Peter-Quill-meets-Ryan-Reynolds-plays-80s-song character? Oh boy.",3
Best monsterverse movie yet,"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire understands exactly what this monsterverse should be better than any other instalment so far. Both the stupidity and sheer scale are taken to new heights whilst finally putting the Titans front and centre. It proves that giant monsters fighting will never get old and is ridiculously entertaining.Fixing one of the most common problems with these films, the human cast is massively trimmed down to only the necessities here. Rebecca Hall is given more to work with, Brian Tyree Henry is a funnier comic relief and Dan Stevens is having so much fun and looking cool doing it.The best performance goes to Kong though, which is a testament to incredibly detailed vfx work on display here. The CG is able to convey his anguish at his loneliness, yearning to find his people and any pain he endures. It really shows that humans aren't needed in these films as Kong can convey all the necessary emotions and most importantly, without dialogue.Adam Wingard's direction has gotten stronger in comparison to the last one. The sense of scale is completely lost at this point but in its place are big monster fights that feel like someone smashing toys together in the best ways. There's several sequences where the Titans move the story forward all on their own, which are always the best part.The music by Tom Holkenborg and Antonio Di lorio really doubles down on the 80s sci-fi vibes with even more synth than last time. When it's accompanying a zero gravity fight at the centre of the earth it helps to turn the whole thing into the biggest Saturday morning cartoon ever made.",8
"Bizarre mystical story but if there is nothing to watch, should be OK","Besides the fact that the main actress now has short hair so instead of a spectacular feminine river flow she looks like a seashore dike and probably fits HW's desire to make genders ""fluid"" and confuse people, and besides turning masculine African Americans into whiners ""jokingly"" saying things to other guys such as ""I would kiss you on your mouth"", or turning Godzilla, the King of Monsters, purple, it was a watchable movie. Obviously, you cannot expect any deep story as it is meant to be a movie where giant monsters are beating the heck out of each other.The ""jokes"" were unfunny too as HW keeps repeating the same formula to the point that it has simply become unbearable. None of the jokes even managed to make me smile let alone laugh.But overall, it was a watchable movie with lots of fights between ""monsters"", decent visuals and special effects and acceptable story.",6
"Nice action, but the story seems to be written by a 4-year old.","Movies about King Kong and Godzilla have been out for almost 100 years of course and have been entertaining the audience a lot all this time. With the arrival of Godzilla in 2014, a new Monsterverse was created in which there was slow work towards the meeting of the giant monkey King Kong and the nuclear lizard Godzilla. Now I have to be honest and the series didn't get any better, because after Godzilla from 2014 and Kong: Skull Island from 2017, in 2019 we got the terribly bad Godzilla: King of Monsters and its successor Godzilla vs. Kong from 2021 didn't get much better on that. At the outcome of the trailer, you already know in advance that this is going to be a CGI festival, just like its predecessors. It was recently a relief to be able to see the Japanese Godzilla Minus One, but you already know in advance that this should not even be in the shadow of that film. Then why still visit this movie? Well, I love monster movies anyway and I'm always curious what people have made of it again, so with fear and trake I look forward to this film again.The story is really too stupid for words, although the story is a lot better than Godzilla: King of the Monsters from 2019, which really didn't have a story in it. It actually occurs from the beginning when Kong turns out to have a toothache. Once to the normal world, a plane thing is pulled, Kong's molar. Yes, that level indeed. The film continues and one is taken to the portals to Hollow Earth across the world, where Monarch keeps an eye on the titans. Meanwhile, Godzilla sleeps in the Italian Colosseum in Rome. Kong gets it up against a number of other monkeys from Hollow Earth and comes across a small monkey there, eventually covering the dreaded Scar King. You already hear it, for the story you don't have to go to the movie and a lot really makes no sense at all. Ilene Andrews is a researcher at Monarch and has taken Jia of Skull Island, one of the last survivors of her tribe, under her care. Why she comes to the blogger Bernie Hayes, who is extremely paranoid, is really still a big mystery. This character really adds absolutely nothing to the story and that is quite clever when you consider that this is one of the main characters from the story.Whatever was feared for, Godzilla x Kong has become a CGI festival. Large parts of the movie you are wondering if you didn't end up in the wrong room, because it looks like a Disney Pixar movie. Of course, there is little to complain about the CGI effects, it's all quite beautifully made. The director on duty also focuses very much on the use of color in the film and works with quite a few lens flares, probably to amplify the 3D version of the film a bit. Towards the end, the film goes wild and the titans end up in Egypt and Brazil where everything has to be broken. It is the most entertaining part of the film, as the throwing and throwing work and the destruction of entire buildings are incessantly brought to the screen. Sometimes it seems as if the creators have played a lot of a loan at the Transformers- films and at the Planet of the Apes- films. Godzilla plays a relatively small role in the film and is eventually only covered for the last half hour. For the rest, the film might as well have been called Kong: Hollow Earth, because the story is actually largely about the big CGI monkey.Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire has become a mediocre job, where the story is really very bad. The action and effects are fine and in that regard time flies by. What is the addition of certain characters in the film remains a big mystery and large parts of the story really make no sense at all. The last half hour (maybe it's forty minutes) are the most entertaining, where everything has to be broken and the battle of the titans is unleashed. Where with most films the 3D effect does not really have added value, it is the case with this film. Especially the use of bright colors and the lens fares and of course the excessive use of CGI let you take you in 3D into a world ruled by monsters. For the rest, the film is really nothing special and when the credits start rolling you are actually wondering what you should think of this. One thing is for sure, it's 100% better than Godzilla: King of the Monsters, but a bit like Godzilla vs. Kong.",5
Entertaining but....,"Godzilla and Kong movies are fun to watch and this new installment was entertaining. For me, it was more detailed and entertaining than Godzilla Vs Kong though, it's screenplay could have been more tight.The story was same like every Godzilla/ Kong movie where new villian monster arrives but it's execution was decent, the screenplay as said earlier could have been more tight, the direction was good, the performances by the cast members were decent and the CGI/ VFX were brilliant.Overall, watch this movie with less or no expectations and you will surely enjoy it. Also, try to watch it in cinemas.",7
A battle between a bad monkey and a good monkey,"""Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire"" is like a rollercoaster ride of epic proportions. Visually, it's a feast for the eyes with mind-blowing VFX that'll leave you in awe. You'll definitely get those goosebumps moments, especially with the characters and some scenes that just hit differently. But, let's be real, the first half kinda feels like it's stuck in neutral, especially when they dive into the whole Hollow Earth thing. And don't even get me started on the climax-it's like they hit fast forward and left us hanging. The characters are badass, no doubt, but they kinda get lost in the shuffle. So, yeah, it's a solid flick, but it could've been a whole lot better.",6
It's entertaining but.. not a great movie.,"Appreciate the cgi, action sequences.Apart from that, this film has a lot of thing that I didn't like.The plot (Story)I always believed that in films, plot and story are the important things you should have, its the fundamentals. I think you can agree with that.In this film... most of what happens here is just ridiculous. You understand when you see the filmHuman charactersKaiju movies... yes. But that doesn't mean we don't need to have a good 'human character'.In GxK, I don't see a person that are actually smart, important and professional enough to deal with this titans.Disappointing villainScar king? Turns out he wasn't intimidating at all... i expect more from him.That's my opinion.",6
Same rehash slop from previous movie,"I'll admit, its easier to watch then GvK. Has less corny humor in this one, and had a huge 80s retro music vibe to it.However, the plot is very basic, and all the interactions involving humans is just side story, nothing else.To sum up the plot, Kong moves to a new neighborhood. No one knows him or fears him. Meets the bully of said neighborhood. Bully has his own version of Godzilla; fight does not go well for Kong. Kong then needs help of a 3rd party to convince Godzilla to help him take down the bully. Godzilla kills a few other monsters to absorb enough nuclear energy to help Kong beat the bully.",5
Great movie & very worthy of 8 stars,"Watched this with my son in IMAX 3D and wow!. This is the first time I have watched a movie in 3D IMAX and what a movie this was to experience it. Blows away standard 3D and the sound was incredible. The movie itself had a good story line & a couple laughs along the way. If you watched the TV Show Monarch, legacy of monsters you can see how that sort of ties in. I would 100% recommend seeing this in IMAX 3D you will not be disappointed. The effects are amazing and if you like the monster universe movies like I do then you are going to love this. A little tip, do not wait around for anything during of after the end credits. There is nothing to see.",8
I enjoyed it more than the original.,"The action scenes were more exciting and cooler visually. The characters had humor, which was missing in the previous movie. There was too much story, though. Kong is being attacked by other apes and an ice dinosaur in Skull Island while the survivors from the first movie go to Skull Island in hopes of having him stop Godzilla from destroying various parts of Asia and Europe. Then they find in a cave with hieroglyphics that a creature who can make peace is the Mothra and must be summoned. Oddly, the creatures find each other in Egypt even though they don't know anything about geography and were countries apart.",7
"Passable, but not great.","I went into this movie with a somewhat hopefulness that it would be enjoyable, and some parts were, while other parts really were just a drag. I don't know about anyone else, but the little girl just bothered me, just like she did in Godzilla vs Kong. Her constantly looking like she's about to cry got old really quick. And then to find out she's the Expected Savior from Skull Island foretold in ancient carvings. OMG how many times is this boring trope gonna be used.Bernie was honestly a useless character. After he figured out it was a distress signal, he provided no useful information or development of the story. He was intended as comic relief, and just wasn't funny.Oh, and how convenient that the abandoned project that would ""extra Arm"" Kong just happened to be in the hollow world all this time. YAWN.One big plus about the movie though, no Millie Bobbie Brown.",5
Awesome,This movie is exceptionally good. People are getting bored from Marvel and DCEU who always does repetitive things but Monsterverse adds new flavour to the action scenes and Godzilla×Kong truly delivered to it.The Fight scenes are amazing and when the Monsters are on the screen you will never be bored. The one problem which was with Godzilla vs Kong was that the story wasn't well written but this time Adam Wingard produced a well written story.A must watch movie but I think it should be watched in 3D to gain maximum reward for the money you paid and it's truly worth it.Truly a BLOCKBUSTER 🔥😍😍,10
"Good titan action, poor everything else","Godzilla vs. Kong is a decent movie, falling somewhere between bad and great. Going in, I tempered my expectations, avoiding comparisons to the masterpiece that is Godzilla Minus One. For the most part, this film holds up well, thanks largely to Kong and his young companion (I believe he was called Suko). These characters possess more depth than the bland, forgettable humans who tend to dull down the narrative. The main ""leads"" contribute little of significance, aside from the occasional exposition dumps. None of them leave a lasting impression.Godzilla's limited screen time is another issue; he appears to cause chaos and then disappears for extended periods. Personally, I still regard the 2014 Godzilla as the best iteration in the Legendary universe. I miss the weighty, deliberate movements and raw power he once possessed. Here, he moves with the speed of a bullet, bordering on cartoonish at times. However, I tried not to let this detract from the enjoyment, as the film isn't meant to be taken too seriously. It's a silly, over-the-top monster flick, featuring spectacular battle sequences. The CGI is nearly flawless throughout, with only a few minor hiccups here and there. The musical score, while not quite on par with King of Monsters, is still commendable.The villain, known as The Scar King, is intriguing but sadly underutilized. Personally, I would have preferred less focus on the human storyline and more exploration of his character and his oppressed society. This could have elevated the film significantly.In conclusion, ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" is an entertaining watch. While it may not achieve the same legendary status as Minus One, it's certainly good enough to keep audiences entertained.Rating: 6/10.",6
a there is a new title idea: Kong: the new a empire.......... oh yeah and also godzilla but he is just in 15 mins and dont do nothing,"If I want to see a superhero movie I would watch Avengers or Justice League but not Godzilla vs. Kong
the monsterverse had potential but after godzilla vs Kong (2021) they made a cinematic universe with great potential in... nothing they lost everything (for me) like I couldn't make a better story but NEVER IN MY LIFE I WOULD GIVE KONG THE POWERS FROM THOR like the B. E. A. S. T glove conducts electricity and then the ax that just a movie ago was the best thing in this world and now it was almost nothing??And also change Godzilla's iconic color to pink 😭
but not to mention the monsters (which I'm still going to talk about) the story isn't very good either, like them going to the hollow earth is cool but now explain
What were Scar King's slaves doing? They couldn't leave that place
I couldn't go to the surface they were just moving rocks from one side to the other
and then the name of the film: GODZILLA X KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE. Like, I even understand New Empire because of the ending where P Kong took Scar King's place, but the part about Godzilla x Kong?Their fight lasted like 2 minutes
I personally didn't like it very much, it's just another cliché monster movie.NOW THE ''VILLAINS?''
Sacr King isn't even some kind of Final Boss, he's just someone who... enslaves monkeys in the hollow earth
and Shimo's look looks like it's made of plastic, I wouldn't do any better because I don't even know how to work with animations or 3D objects, but whoever made Monster Zero, Mechagodzilla and SkullCrawler were all very well-crafted antagonists, and why did she end up looking like a Kong's kind of dog???The best part of this film is sko and the humans who were still horrible
even my favorite character (godzilla) just slept for more than half the film and in the end he did almost nothing, mothra might as well
who, by the way, also did almost nothing.",4
Brainless Kaiju Fun,"I went into it without much expectation and that saved me most of the pain but not all as this was a very slightly above average film with some decent and terrible cgi monsters bashing one another with a story shoved in between. However, most of the cgi is good, the bad is just at the start of the film with the first battle (if you can call it that). The story is outlandish but works for plot sake and the humans aren't too annoying at least. Kong is quite good in this film, similar to Kong vs Godzilla he is the main kaiju in this film whilst Godzilla is at the sidelines which was a shame. The battles in the film go by way to quickly and don't have much substance to them which is annoying as in previous films such as K vs G and GKOTM have shown they can have great kaiju battles with cool choreography. I really wanted to love this film like others but just can't when I can clearly see better films within the monsterverse such as the examples before. It's clear that they didn't put enough money into cgi production as some scenes look bad or not as good as others and the battles scenes are just not that good. You can have fun with the film of course as I did when I was watching it but after you're done you realise the potential it had and that makes you depressed. It does give me hope that the future of the monsterverse is more kaiju focused than human focused as kongs journey in the film was really interesting and at this point the audience has grown attached to him over the past two movies he's been in previously. This is a 6-6.5/10 film depending on how generous you are on the day.",6
Fun Monster Clashes!,"'Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire' is not a perfect film, but for a blockbuster it delivers on the pure monster action it promises.Oftentimes in monster features, you tend to get a massive amount of human character scenes and very little monster sequences as an attempt to build up tension. However, this film gives the viewer a lot of monster focused content which was actually quite refreshing. In particular, I really enjoyed Kong's major scene and how they chose to have no human characters explaining what is going on. Instead they allow the audience to look at the body language to interpret what is going on. It was definitely my favourite part!Although, the human sequences in this bring it down a little. The first half an hour is a lot of exposition on what has happened in previous films and how characters relate to each other. Furthermore, some of the film's CGI needed more work. For such a CGI heavy film, the computer generated effects need to be as good as possible. I do recommend seeing this if you are a fan of monster action type films. You will get a massive amount of fun creature clashes!",6
very dumb but great monster fights,"The ""MonsterVerse"" movies in the past decade have mainly focused on Godzilla and Kong. In the newly released GODZILLA x KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE, they are forced to team up with each other yet again to fight a dangerous threat. If you have your brain on at all while watching this movie, you will think it's very bad. In the past, I've wanted them to give the human characters better writing so I could care about them. After watching this, I have changed my mind. If they make another one, simply take out the humans all together. Watching certain scenes made me realize that they don't need dialogue to move the story forward. The only reason humans have to be in this is to spoon-feed exposition to the audience, making it seem like we're stupid. If they fully focus on Godzilla and Kong in this ""new empire"", it could be a very interesting movie. In this world, Godzilla has nothing to do except build up his power while Kong is dealing with the new threat down on Hollow Earth (don't get me started on that). Now that I've gotten that off my chest, turning my brain off during this experience, I really enjoyed the monsters beating the crap out of other monsters. The fight scenes are some of the best to come out of this frankly tepid universe of movies. This one had the potential to have great human relationship moments, and even a great monster relationship, but it just kept flying to the next thing. The only human I DID enjoy was Trapper (Dan Stevens), the ""monster veterinarian"". He was hilarious. If you enjoy monster fights, I recommend GODZILLA x KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE.",6
Just bad and goofy and also bad,"Ok, it goes like this. Girl who is last of her tribe and also deaf. Stop. Stop right there. When a story starts like this you know the rest of it is going to be a miserable, predictable watch. As it turns out that's exactly what ensues. Not the fun kind of predictable that you might be hoping for. The kind of low quality predictability that requires me to hunt for nearly random word to even finish this review. On top of that the CGI is lazy and looks like something you'd see in a five dollar video game. If your choice is between watching drool slide down a friend's face or watching this then definitely choose the drool. At least you'll have something to laugh at with that friend in years to come.",4
Great monster action,"I enjoyed Godzilla x Kong. I thought they did a great job with the monster fights and even the story between the monsters. To me, they used the humans to explain the narrative that the monster couldn't. Trapper and Bernie that kept the human story from being completely boring. Scar King is good villian how he struck fear in the other Kongs. Glad to see the introduction of other monsters and seeing both Kong and Godzilla have battles with them. I am a big Godzilla fan and I always would like to see more of him. Even though he didn't have as much screen time as Kong when he was on screen I appreciate how he was used. I liked what they did with Kongs story and the visuals of hollow earth are great.",8
Still fun monster battles,"'Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire' is the 5th film in Warners Bros. ""MonsterVerse"", and like all of them does a solid job of making giant Titans/Kaiju fight, with a bit of a storyline holding it together. Returning are Dr Andrews (Hall), head of the Titan-watch company, her adopted daughter Jia (Hottle) and Bernie (Henry), the comedic relief. The new addition is Trapper (Stevens), the vet. The plot is mostly Kong-centric, now that he lives in ""hollow Earth"" and Godzilla's on the surface.Kong finds another part of ""hollow Earth"" (best not to ask too many questions, as physics went out the window a long time ago in these films) that has other apes and Titans, setting in motion a big battle with the 'Scar King', a giant Orangutan. This necessitates a semi-forced team-up with Godzilla, with the help of an unexpected Titan. There's some time spent on Jia's journey, but not too much that you get bored of the humans!As always, the CGI is pretty good, and Kong has more empathy than some human actors. Godzilla still looks great - and gets his ""pink plates"" upgrade. When they're fighting each other or different Titans, it's always pretty impressive to see. Nothing crazily spectacular here, but nor is it boring or excessively dumb. Good se of KISS' ""I Was Made For Loving You""!",6
"It had its moments, but there just wasn't the hype","I'll start by saying that nobody who goes to watch ""Godzilla x Kong"" really cares about what's going on in the movie. We're there to see monsters fight, and anything else, unless compelling, is filler to be ignored. If all you're looking for are monster fights, there's plenty of them here, and they're decent too - both the visuals and the action. Sadly everything else is so silly that it's almost self aware of its silliness. It's an undeniable step down from the first (which in itself wasn't anything too special), and while promising at first with Kong finding his place in Hollow Earth, it soon becomes a nothing story with nothing to hype it up. Overall though, you just want to see Godzilla and Kong kick some ass and there's plenty, and I mean PLENTY of it here.",5
GXK comes out punching.... LITERALLY!,"I watched it on the big screen in IMAX and it's the only way to see this! Been a Godzilla and Kong fan my whole life and seeing every movie from the beginning starting with King Kong in 1933, it's come a long way!I thought the CGI and effects were great, it had a good story too. You are able to learn more about the Hollow Earth and what lies deep in the uncharted territory. There's so much more to explore there, hoping they will come out with more after this flick!I loved GVK but this movie had more action with fights every other scene. I liked the new look for Godzilla, it's always good to see him evolve. Kong will always be my favorite though, maybe now he can get his ""King"" title!For all fans of Godzilla and Kong, it's well worth it... the real fans will notice some little details they threw in from the TOHO showa era!",10
Absolute Rubbish... but ENTERTAINING rubbish,"I liked 2014's Godzilla. I found Kong Skull Island okay. I haven't seen the Monarch TV Series or the second Godzilla film or GvK but I kinda wanted to see this because I was in the mood for some CGI, loud, bombastic fun... and in that regard, the film didn't disappoint at all. It delivers on that promise of bright lights, colour, action and overwhelming sound effects.But unfortunately, even though I went in looking for that kind of fun movie, this film is all over the place. The story is just rubbish. It's garbage. I didn't understand what most of the people were doing or why, I kept seeing massive plot holes and the human characters weren't the best...But again, I did enjoy it. It's entertaining if nonsensical. I didn't go expecting a brilliant film but I did think that the story really could have been improved. Fun, entertaining, loud CGI effects laden films and films with a half-way decent story shouldn't be mutually exclusive. They can mix. On this occasion, they didn't in my opinion.",6
"Everything I disliked about the last 'Monsterverse' movie, squared.","Skar-king, an evil giant ginger-ape, along with his minions and an enslaved kaiju plan on escaping the Hollow Earth hell to which they had been confined and conquering the planet's surface. Standing in the way of this existential threat to humanity is Kong, Godzilla, and their puny human allies. The target audience of this jejune opus is unclear - the bloodless action and comic relief seems to target undiscerning children yet the soundtrack is rocking-oldies, perhaps in an attempt to placate adults trying to remain interested (or awake). The cast is a bland generic mix playing bland generic 2D characters, with an expressionless Kaylee Hottle back as mute Jia so we can have some cloying new-agey scenes of her signing to the giant simian and Brian Tyree Henry returning to provide some near-pathologically-unfunny comic relief as a talkative conspiratorial podcaster. Kaiju anthropomorphisation continues: Kong now looks like a hairy old-testament patriarch-bodybuilder (with no gonads), Godzilla, despite being CGI moves even more like a person in a costume than he did in the 1960s, Scar King looks like a skinny guy in an orangutan costume (with no gonads), and Mothra looks like a giant moth with Cyd Charisse's legs. The plot is nonsensical - just a bunch of set-pieces glued together by some kind of vague unobtanium-technology and incredibly contrived 'twists' (Kong's metal-arm features prominently on the posters but its provenance in the storyline is ridiculously convenient and silly). The 'monster fights' are a mixed bag - the opening battle in Rome is pretty good but the finale, complete with 'cool' slow-mo and freeze-frame effects is derivative and boring. Likely targeting toyetic profits, Kong has a new sidekick - a ginger 'mini-me', proving that the writers hadn't learned from 'Son of Godzilla' (1967) that cute baby-kaiju are unwelcome in anything but Saturday-morning cartoons (I'm concerned that in addition to his new pink-highlights, Godzilla will show up in Legendary's next film with 'Godzooky' in tow). I was hoping that that last year's 'Godzilla Minus One' signaled a slowing in the decent of the franchise into pure dreck but sadly this outing (number 38 by my count) has just re-accelerated the unfortunate downward trajectory of Japan's iconic over-sized radioactive metaphor.",3
"Fun, Popcorn Kaiju Movie that Keeps Getting Bigger","This was a movie that I heard was coming out but wasn't overly excited for. I'm not sure why since these are fun. I look at them like comic book movies. My guess is that Godzilla Minus One blew me away that these pale in comparison now. Regardless, I saw this the opening Thursday at the Gateway Film Center. I had a list of movies to see for the weekend and this one worked best that day.Synopsis: two ancient titans, Godzilla and Kong, clash in an epic battle as humans unravel their intertwined origins and connection to Skull Island's mysteries.We start this off seeing King Kong as he now lives in the Hollow Earth area under the surface. He roams and hunts, killing other things for food. The giant gorilla is searching for others like him but hasn't found anything. At the end of this opening sequence, there's an earthquake that reveals there's something underneath. We also see a Monarch base nearby that is picking up something as well. It looks like an uncharted area that is subterranean.Up above, Godzilla is still roaming the world and defeating titans that are getting out of their territory. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) is the head of Kong operations for Monarch. They're getting a signal that they cannot explain. She notices that her daughter, Jia (Kaylee Hottle), is drawing the signal. She tells Ilene that it feels like someone is calling out to her psychically. This signal causes her to reach out to Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry). He's a conspiracy theorist blogger and podcaster who is right about things. He thinks outside of the box so she needs his help.Godzilla also seems to be affected by this signal. We see him attack a power plant in France, drawing its power. He then sets his sights on attacking Tiamat, another titan who absorbs solar energy. King Kong also comes up to the surface. He has an infected tooth so Monarch reaches out to Trapper (Dan Stevens) for help. He's a titan veterinarian. They replace the tooth with a metal one. This must be done fast before Godzilla comes after him for the invasion of his territory.This signal needs to be figured out before it is too late. Ilene leads a team of Trapper, Mikael (Alex Ferns), Bernie and Jia to figure it out. They find that the Monarch base in Hollow Earth is destroyed. They discover a temple that looks to be made by humans. This also reveals a legend that involves King Kong, Godzilla and other titans. One of which is known as the Skar King and the other is Shiva. King Kong isn't strong enough to defeat this threat alone, he'll need help. Monarch must convince Godzilla and other titans to prevent the destruction of the planet as we know it.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is that the best part of these movies for me, outside of the action and battle sequences, is the lore they continue to build on. They will take entities from religion and incorporate them into being titans. Here that includes Tiamat and Shiva. Or they'll take conspiracy theories like Hollow Earth and use that as well. This is also good here is that they borrow from earlier kaiju movies for story elements. I'm a fan there as well. I wanted to give this information to delve deeper into them.Where I'll then go would be with the new titans here. I'd say that these are good to build on what the previous movie set up. We know coming in that Hollow Earth is a thing for this world. King Kong knows that his species had called this world home, but he can't find them. He's continuing that search. This leads him to go deeper into the subterranean area. That's where more legends are explored. Kong's race are defenders of humanity. Godzilla is the defender of Earth. What is interesting is that we learnt about Skar King, which was good. It also introduces Shiva, which I know is from Hinduism. This is more closely to the Final Fantasy games which is the god of ice. This deity here is supposed to be a rival of Godzilla or at least that's how they present this. There are more elements here of the tribe that lived on Skull Island. Also, Tiamat is a Mesopotamian goddess and appears in Final Fantasy games, normally as a villain.I want to shift to this last idea here. This plays with the idea that Kong is looking for others like him. He has no place. The same can be said for Jia. She is struggling in school. Ilene is determined to make her feel welcome or find something that does. This does bring heart to the movie that I appreciated. The idea is explored even more as we discover other giant apes and Jia's missing tribe.All that is left for the story is that I noticed there's less commentary here about the environment. I'm fine with that. They went a bit heavy with this idea in the last couple movies. This is focused more on Hollow Earth. This leans to saving the world from destruction as well. I'd also say that we're seeing that there's a vet to help titans, Trapper. Also, they're still dealing with the government wanting to take over the program. That's more of a passing idea. Something that stressed me out though was seeing the titans destroy things like the Colosseum or the great pyramids of Giza. I've seen the former and know how breathtaking it is, so there's that realist part of me that got tense.Let's then go over to what this is all about, filmmaking. What I mean here is the CGI and effects. These movies are working with high budgets so the effects are on point. I'll be honest, they look great, especially on the big screen. These movies are made for it. They're CGI-fest like the comic book movies. I still have fun with the fight sequences. They do wild things there. I love seeing Godzilla wreck other monsters and buildings. Cinematography is good with how they frame things and bring places that don't exist to life. That was good. The soundtrack also didn't seem to feature the iconic Godzilla theme which is an issue for me. Other than that, the rest of the music worked and the sound design to bring these creatures to life.All that is left then is acting. Hall is fine here. She's a good actress, but her performance isn't a focus. I like her as this scientist wanting to help Kong and in turn, the world. Henry adds comedy. He's also smart about things that people don't believe in. I liked the addition of Stevens. He's a surfer guy who is just having a good time. He's also smart in his field. Hottle was solid in her role. She is featured prominently again and that worked for what they did there. Ferns, Fala Chen and the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed. Again, the kaijus are the focus here. No one is bad though, which is all I ask.In conclusion, this is a fun popcorn movie. I include these in horror since I just lump in kaiju film. This isn't traditional horror outside of that. What I'll say is that I love building more on the mythology of these monsters. Seeing them do battle is the draw. Incorporating more titans is great. This is well made. They have a big budget so the CGI looks good. The framing and cinematography to capture all this is good. Won't be for everyone, but if you want something to shut off your brain and roll with, this is for you.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",7
Disappointed,"Godzilla Minus One has set the bar just too high. This movie was way below the previous version. Godzilla is reduced to supporting role. Godzilla just sleeps, wakes up, fights and then again goes to sleep. The human characters are just so uninspiring. Now every Godzilla movie will be compared to Minus One's standards.The villain of the movie, Scar, I expected more from him. Scar never looked dominating. It just used Shimu to fight. Even the Mecha was better than Scar. Godzilla has become boring since there is really no challenge to Godzilla. We already know the result of the fight whenever Godzilla is pitted against any Monster. There is no vulnerability and without vulnerability, Godzilla is reduced to just plot tool.",6
Good entertainment,"This film was very fun to watch. It's re-watchable for its pure entertainment value. The action begins as soon as the movie starts and it doesn't let up until the credits roll. It is by no means a perfect film. The human characters continue being the worst part about these films. The majority of the human characters are unnecessary. The humor from the human characters often felt forced and childish. Even the plot could have been pushed forward without the humans and made this more enjoyable.The special affects are good throughout the majority of the film. Although, Kong does look a bit cartoony at the beginning of the film right before the title card. Godzilla is the best looking monster out of all the creatures but he unfortunately had the least amount of screen time. The story focuses mostly on Kong so don't expect too much from Godzilla.Overall this was a good film to catch on the big screen and enjoy with the family.",6
Bad,"It feels empty. I don't feel a connection to either of the characters.Same old setting, where an american movie makes me feel empathy for the ""monster in the movie"", and it's starting to feel disgusting to watch such movies. A monster is a monster, you try to make it look like the good guy but eventually, danger and fierceness are objective truth be told, it will remain a monster. I could care less (and many others), if you continuously tell me that a bad situation could indiscriminately turn into a meaningful lesson, which is false. You can't expect everyone to think worryless and accept everything good or bad, whatsoever. Such as movies that continuously tell you that normal is not normal and that you need to be absurd to live a peaceful life, because that is the message. Godzilla needs to impose fear and have an all-out war with humanity, the same as Kong. Not a dozen of people trying to help them get along and brush their teeth.The story is almost the same as the last movie. Some federal agents trying to find out who the next targeted monster, is. Now, is not Godzilla that is hunting for Kong, it's just Kong discovering a new land and a new enemy, which is a boring turn. It's also taking too long to get to the main plot. Again, nothing new..Comedy is sketchy as always and as well as breathed. Besides, comedy should have not made an appearance in such an apocalyptic story. The black guy from the last movie which is on this, too, is still not funny, just a forced humor; which is not homophobic if you wonder, but telling the reality of things.Visual effects are monotone, there are too many special effects and lack real response on the setting, a natural landscape; not one made by a computer or less of any of it.I don't recommend this movie.",3
A Monster Mash!!,"If you like giant monster fights, you'll love this film! This movie is packed with tons of great Kaiju on Kaiju fights. The film does a good job showing a great dynamic between Godzilla and Kong, almost reminds me of a brother relationship with how they fight and get along to team up. The villain is a very menacing creature and is a great opposite to Kong. The Human cast is good, it's about what you'd expect from a Godzilla/Kong movie. The film does a really amazing job not focusing too much on the filler human stories and highlights the true stars of the movie, Godzilla and Kong! The movie also has some great comedic moments with ""Mini Kong"" and the human cast. Overall a solid film! So if you like Godzilla, Kong, or giant monsters in general, you love this film!! Don't worry about critic ratings, movies like this aren't made for them anyway!",10
I'm a little bit puzzled by the title of this . . .,". . . picture. The main character seems to be named ""G-o-d-z-i-l-l-a X. Kong."" That dude's Christian name is so outlandish that it is not even recognized by this site's spellchecker. Furthermore, the last name is not such an acceptable moniker, either. Other than Donkey Kong, who used to play for the Lions, how many Kong's are known to the average person? Not very many. Hong Kong doesn't really count, since that denotes a city in Asia--NOT an individual person. Finally, viewers are never informed as to what Kong's middle initial abbreviates. Here again the choices appear to be rather limited. There's Xavier, known mostly as a school with a basketball team. Beyond that, X-Ray is about the only other option, and linguists generally won't count that one.",7
Garbage,"I was really excited for Godzilla vs. Kong, but it let me down. The story felt thin, and I just couldn't get attached to any of the characters. It seemed like all the effort went into the special effects, (and even the cgi sucked) and not enough into the story that makes you care. Sometimes, the fights were so over the top that I couldn't even keep up, and instead of being fun, it was just confusing. I wanted to love it for the spectacle, but without a story to hook me, I walked away feeling pretty disappointed. I don't recommend wasting your time watching this garbage, just walk away or watch anything else.",1
Great Action Pack Movie,"If you're a big fan of Kong, you're absolutely gonna love this. Kong is a legend, that's all I have to say. I'm team Kong all the way. I'm not gonna give away any spoilers but I must say this was really good, the directors stepped their game up with Godzilla X Kong. The last movie wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I went to go see the early premiere, I didn't want to see the movie at first but I'm glad I did. There are some scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat and there's like one scene that may or may not make you cry. It's a good movie, one of the best of 2024, if you're looking for a great action pack movie, I highly recommend you go see Godzilla x Kong.",9
Repetitive.,"This movie delivers classic kaiju action: fun, accessible, but ultimately forgettable in the MonsterVerse landscape. While the visuals are fantastic, with tons of epic monster brawls on screen, the plot feels a bit thin, especially the final fight. The human characters are purely functional, there to explain things and move the story along, leaving the kaiju with surprisingly more personality. Ideally, both humans and monsters would be compelling characters, but here we're left with cool fights but a lack of emotional investment. It's a popcorn flick, pure and simple.A thing I might add is, can Legendary not spoil a villain (and/or their power) for once?",6
I knew it would be downhill from the axe,"The positive reviews on here must be fake. This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Cash grab City.They did this weird thing trying to humanize King Kong, genius writers entirely missed the point. They see some old KK scenes where humans and Kong interact or have similarities, and think ""Wow, we are same same! King Kong is just like us, he's truly so human at heart!""You fools! King Kong is the the king of apes, he is a wild beast, any similarity is because we are apes, not because he's human!Before you even understand what's happening King Kong is on a human style heroic journey, Disney style, befriending his enemies and... Just, I can't.Watch this movie, but so you can just get it out of your system and give up on Hollywood all together, not to enjoy.",1
""" Blockbuster Fun - Godzilla X Kong ""","I did not have any expectations whatsoever before watching the film , after the trailers dropped I was kind of disappointed , but it was one hell of a ride in the theatres. Really enjoyed it. It is fun , action - packed , it has comedy , two or more gigantic monsters fighting on the big screen and it was damn fun. Kong is the main focus of the story and it does make sense because he is a character that can connect with people. The human characters are actually likable in this one especially Brian Tyree Henry as Bernie and Dan Stevens as Trapper. Rebecca Hall's character Dr. Irene Andrews is good aswell. But the main thing I loved about the film was it's epic climax. It was great. Overall the film is fun and entertaining that's all.",7
Switch off brain before viewing,"The perfect definition of a ""popcorn movie"".It's full of amazing effects, loud and adrenaline fuelled action scenes and the children loved it.The story however was little bit of a mess, even when not expecting anything Oscar winning going into it.Far too many convenient coincidences, such as just happening to have a metal right handed fist just lying around in hollow earth, makes even a fantasy movie hard to follow.And therefore hard to become invested in when we move from one action set piece to the next with no real feeling of jeopardy.The monsters all did their thing but the human 'comic relief' didn't really hit the spot for me.I guess sometimes it's ok to just sit back and enjoy some dumb entertainment on the big screen from time to time though.Not one I will remember or watch again.",6
"A Serviceable Sequel, nothing more.","At the risk of sounding pretentious, after seeing Godzilla: Minus One less than five months ago, my expectation for what a kaiju movie completely changed. Wherein that film was a thoughtful, exciting, and mature take on Godzilla, using the monster as a backdrop for bigger things, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire...is mostly just monster stuff.And hey, that's not necessarily a bad thing. People have been clamouring for an American kaiju movie that sets the human characters aside and focuses primarily on the massive creatures that destroy our cities. Godzilla x Kong: TNE does this pretty well; spending the vast majority of its run time in ""Hollow Earth"", a realm beneath our own where Kong now lives, full of fascinating (and gargantuan) creatures.My favourite parts of the movie were where the monsters - mostly Kong - interacted with other monsters. It was a surprisingly good showcase of non verbal storytelling that naturally, gives this movie a lot of international appeal.But, I can't help but feel this movie could be and should be...more? It really does feel like a Kong movie that Godzilla just happens to feature in; his inclusion almost feels unnecessary. Then, of course, there are the human characters.Minus One PROVED that great human drama and characters are not only possible, but elevate kaiju movies. This one isn't bad; Rebecca Hall and Dan Stevens are fine; Brian Tyree Henry is on the verge of being annoying, but he works. The little girl is really terrible. Somehow, despite have zero spoken dialog, she can't properly convey the emotions she's supposed to be expressing with her face alone. Unintentional hilarity ensues.There's also more people like her, who are weirdly and inexplicably mute, and in a movie with so much grunting and roaring, I felt that was an odd choice. The lore of the movie is pretty tacked on and doesn't leave much of an impression (it also doesn't make a lot of sense, but it's fine).Overall, Godzilla x Kong: TNE is FINE. It's nothing particular special, and it's not bad. But I can only hope for the next one, we get a bit more ambition and creativity.",6
what's going on?,"Is this the direction the monsterverse is going toward? Just dumping $$$ on the visuals. That doesn't make a good movie tho. The dialogs are cringe, story plot is very predictable. And there's is meaningful character development.How's Godzilla being depicted as a hero character when he casually kills millions every time he walks thru a city? Not to mention it's getting boring now whenever he powers up thru his spines. It was cool in 2014 but it's 2024 and do they still expect us to get excited by the atomic breath?Can characters stop cracking jokes every chance they get? Is that too much to ask nowadays? Especially when a guy is eaten by a tree, it is supposed to be horrifying.",3
What a Banger,"Let's grab this one first. This movie is NOT Minus One, it will never be Minus One. But, this movie, in its own way, is amazing. It's funny, it's entertaining, it's overall fun.All the characters play off eachother well, all characters have a connection, all characters have chemistry. And that's not just Human Characters, Godzilla and Kong are amazing in this one too! Skar King is also awesome, him and Shimo pose an actual threat that is seen through the whole movie and not just the end like Godzilla Vs. Kong. All the twists and all the details are 10/10. The story is amazing, just go see it.",9
A Good Entertaining Movie but not as great as the previous MonsterVerse movies.,"Overall Godzilla X Kong The New Empire is a good entertaining movie which has some flaws especially too much humour but the overall storyline and cast performance is great, the two giants Godzilla and Kong are the highlights of the movie it comes and just promises to deliver even more interesting moments between them, however Godzilla is barely not seen that much in this movie but Kong is absolutely brilliant. Female characters of the MonsterVerse movies are a complete waste as they don't have much to do, cast did well, story is engaging and interesting, Direction is good too it keeps you hooked especially at the best moments of the movie.Overall the film is a good watch not perfect but still a good decent watch entertainer which isnt a stand out of the MonsterVerse movies but still a thumbs up I would say it's good. A 7/10 stars.",7
"Made it to my top2 worst movies, ever, nonsense paradise","A movie that missed to implement even the expected cliches. Only the murderer lift movie was worse, was my first thought after I left the cine. I had absolutely no idea about what was going on the whole time. When I thought I did, they threw in some new thing that made the whole thing just even more nonsense. So many ways they could have made this film better. The little girls visions (more of it), the guy that died (???) maybe a love story? So many missed opportunities for us connect with the characters. I found myself laughing throughout the last 1/3 in several occasions. Painful to watch. I don't know how it got even a 2. Rotten tomato award for me, and that is not only this years but my forever charts for sure.",1
Another Monsterverse Success,I went and saw this yesterday with my dad and a couple of friends and it was amazing it was really funny and I loved how Godzilla got more powerful throughout the movie and Kong getting a glove that is extremely powerful and i thought it was interesting that it took place more on Hollow Earth rather than actual Earth as it has been in the previous Godzilla movies and Godzilla Vs Kong and I think it's just as good as Godzilla Vs Kong but this one is a little bit better but it's another great movie and I can't wait to see what will be next either a tv show or a movie who knows I'm curious what's gonna happen next.,10
The studio paid attention to the audience!,"I am a fan of the Monsterverse. Having said that, I liked Godzilla (2014) over all the other films save Kong: Skull Island. After the last couple of films, I went in with lowered expectations for this. What I ended up viewing was an unexpected surprise.The pacing is MUCH quicker in this movie. The monsters take up the majority of the screentime with minimal focus on the humans. This made a huge difference.My main complaint with the film is a minor quibble of personal taste. I am a Godzilla fan over Kong. Kong is the focal point of the story, with Godzilla only showing up when necessary (this happens several times, mind you.) I also found the mystery kaiju baddie to be slightly lame, but when you see the last shot of Kong in the movie, the choice made sense.I have seen the film twice. It did not grow stale on second viewing!",7
Godzilla X Kong: The odd Couple ends,"Godzilla and King Kong don't work. They don't match; they are a bad couple. They place an unbearable burden on a screenplay that tries to include them both. As such the Monsterverse surely can't continue: it needs to pick a focus and relegate the other co-lead to a guest star, or 'recurring character' status. Either that or pull the plug entirely.The 'two couples' matchup isn't dramatic because it isn't plausible because it is completely contrived and blatantly impractical.The plot and characters suffer heavily because this film is entirely stymied by it's central miscasting, which is the miscasting of the whole Monsterverse: this franchise ain't big enough for the two of them.It ends up working like a two hour trailer with a storyline held together by a humanised Kong story about his loneliness and aging being parallelled by his human friends. Apart from that tenuous connective tissue the film is all made up of character entrances, a quick distinctive skit, and then cut. Just like a trailer. Or, if it has less overall thrust to it, a ""best of"" highlights reel.There is also an effort to further expand the Hollow Earth issues but that barely registers as a success because it isn't very interesting.The cinematography and direction are mediocre at best, with murky and unappealing photography of the cast in almost all human character scenes.The sound design barely registers except in an effort to portray the monsters calls.I rate at 3/10 because the film doesn't work. The Monsterverse doesn't work because it's an odd couple of stars. Too odd. I recommend to confirmed fans only.",3
Big Lizard and Monkey team up to smash other Lizard and Monkey.,"I feel like the studio is listening to the fans. There were far less human driven plotlines. The humans were mostly there just to add the explanation for what was happening. Dan Stevens proves he can crush any role he's given. He had the best performance staring as hot Ace Ventura.My biggest complaint is while Godzilla got top billing this was mostly a Kong movie. I guess Universal is leaning into the part of the franchise they own. The other Godzilla Kaiju that makes an appearance was also minimal - and unnecessary. Godzilla could have taken on every one else - even Kong with his upgrades.But if you go in knowing what you expect and don't expect more, it's a good time.",6
Rember The Titans Minus Denzel,"This is one for the cinemas. You want the biggest screen and the most thunderous sound to really take advantage of this movie.The story is ok, the acting etc is all servicable but its all about the Titans.A couple of areas where the film falls, Mothra has become a massive fairy straight out of a little kids movie and the film starts to feel a bit like Transformers and their gang of cool kids.Additionally the soundtrack is a massive miss, with 'classic' 80's tracks really just going for the teen viewers parents market. It doesn't add to the film at all.At the end of the day its a Titan fest so its all good :)",6
Forgot new planet Earth and universe - very nice to play in...,"Forgot there are humans and words...but overall very solid movie! Humans covered all cliche's nicely. Words and words, some more words - OH also gestures. The world is pretty amazing, (a friendlier Avatar world) easy to get to, and great animals/plants. Hmm well the big 4 (and few others) are amazing. I missed or part of brain holding memories from intro movie are gone. Going to avoid ruining anything by talking more. You already made up your mind - because it's GODZILLA!! Haha have fun (movie will test boyfriends and reverse - so hope you know your partner well.) Parents: No nudity or sex, or alcohol I can't remember anyone swearing, except the monsters....",7
What a waste of money and resources,"How can companies like Warner brothers and legendary pictures? Create such a dumb movie I mean the only reason I watched it till the end is just to see what Godzilla will do. Otherwise this is a movie that is extremely terrible and has no actual story to it and the worst part of it all is the cast, the script, especially when that main actress talks it's so cliché it's beyond cringe
The cast is just terrible and completely don't belong in the movie and what's with all the writers or actually I think there were no writers for this film because even people from high school can literally create the same script that I was hearing in the movie how major Studios doing such brainless movies like this it will hurt the franchise of Godzilla Thank God for the other movie that was released months ago, which is the original story of Godzilla.",2
Wrestlemania Styled Event,"I saw Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, starring Rebecca Hall-The Night House, Iron Man 3; Dan Stevens-Legion_tv, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb; Brian Tyree Henry-Bullet Train, Joker_2019 and Kaylee Hottle-this is her second movie, after Godzilla vs. Kong.This is the sequel to the 2021 Godzilla vs. Kong and the latest installment in the Monsterverse. Rebecca returns with her adopted daughter Kaylee and we learn more about the mysteries of Skull Island, Hollow Earth, and other assorted Titans/monsters. Dan is a friend/veterinarian/pilot that adds some comedy to the intense situations and Brian is a blogger along for the ride to get more followers for his podcast. You meet more Titans and apes, including Skar-an ape-and his enslaved captive pet Shimo, a Titan with ice powers that Skar sicks on Kong and Godzilla. Suko is sort of a mini Kong, but no relation to Kong. During a fight, Kong hurts his hand and thanks to Dan and Rebecca, gets an upgrade to a new augmented glove called B. E. A. S. T.-Bio Enhanced Anatomech Seismic Thunder-which comes in handy for the big free for all near the end when all the Titans get into a wrestlemania styled tag team event. FYI: There is an appearance of a really well known Titan named Mothra.It's rated PG-13 for creature violence and action and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes.I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",8
Dumb Fun. Better than the previous one,"The Monsterverse films got progressively less serious in all aspects with each movie until Godzilla vs Kong in 2021 which became so completely ridiculous and fun that it was impossible to believe it was in the same universe as the 2014 Godzilla. It was mainly due to that I didn't like it much the first time but learned to appreciate it more on a rewatch for what it was rather than expecting a consistent tone from this particular cinematic franchise. Even though this one continues to be dumb fun it felt like a step up from the previous one. The central character here is essentially Kong and everyone else is a supporting character. Being the most emotionally available, that throughline itself was more than what the previous one offered. But here, the film is self-aware enough to call itself out but doesn't try to ram it too much.Brian Tyree Henry was annoying af in the previous movie and would've changed nothing if he and the characters with him were removed from that movie. Here, he manages to be charming enough to fit into that comic relief role. The introduction to Dan Stevens's character made me feel like it would be another annoying character but he turned out to be one of the best things of this movie for me. A lovable hippy with great comic chemistry with Brian Tyree Henry.The action and visuals were plenty and good for such a fun dumb movie. The writing is just there to justify the action and really nothing more. No point trying to find depth or logic in it. The inconsistencies in the franchise are growing but at this point, I don't think anyone really cares.Every time Mothra has an appearance they subtly use the music from the original song of 1961 into the soundtrack without it playing out in the open. Give us the modern Mosra song already, please.",6
The MonsterVerse is dead,"Embarrassing that grown adults made these choices. Complete & total nonsense with the most mind numbing jumble of flashing VFX. Trying to make it lighthearted should work but it just makes it worse..

Awsome and fun monster movie !,"Went in this movie with a open mind and turned out to be one of the best Godzilla and kong movie I have ever seen and it brought a lot of nostalgia for me and hit home for me growing up watching all the Toho movies Godzilla, Mothra and Rodan. The visuals were amazing to me never once did I see a part of this movie that didn't look finished everything was so emmersive and alive the scenes with just the monsters were also great it added a new element in this monster verse it truly was one crazy wild ride that I won't forget I hope they make a trilogy out of the Godzilla and kong movies cause when it ended I wanted more any one that is a monster fan should love this movie because I did and thanks again for everyone that worked on this film brought alot of good childhood memories back for me!",10
A Titan Clash with Spectacular Visuals,"'Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire' packs a punch with its gripping action and the adorable relationship between Kong and Mini Kong. The titans certainly deliver on their role, but the humans also play a significant part in the film's narrative and take up equal screen time in this one.However, a slightly longer runtime could have allowed for more titan screen time and a slower pace to fully let viewers indulge in the epic showdown.Despite this, the film roars with its stunning visual effects and heart pounding action sequences. Watch it in IMAX to appreciate every moment of the monstrous clash.Overall, the film offers a thrilling cinematic experience that will leave fans of the MonsterVerse craving for more!",7
Godzilla x Kong: A Disastrous Disappointment,"This cinematic catastrophe is an affront to the very concept of filmmaking. A soulless, mind-numbing experience that insults the intelligence of its audience. The ""story"" is a jumbled mess of nonsensical plot twists, cringe-worthy dialogue, and laughable character development.The ""acting"" is a joke, with wooden performances that make you wonder if the actors were even aware of the script's absurdity. The only redeeming quality is the impressive ""special effects"", which are a rare bright spot in this mess.The ""action"" scenes are a jumbled mess of loud, frantic chaos, with no coherence or purpose. The ""plot"" is a sloppy, contrived mess, with characters making ridiculous decisions and convenient coincidences.The script is an absolute travesty, with characters speaking in clichés and one-liners that make you roll your eyes. The ""world-building"" is non-existent, with Hollow Earth feeling like a hastily thrown-together excuse for a setting.Avoid this monstrosity at all costs. If you value your sanity, stay far, far away from this garbage. Leave Godzilla to the Japanese, where it belongs.",3
"A Silly Popcorn Movie, But Fun!","After the TV series Monarch, which had its light moments but had a seriously dramatic bent, GvK:TNE is a silly adventure story: one part Planet of the Apers, one part The A-Team, and one part The Avengers with 300-foot apes and lizards.Like the MCU following the spy thriller Captain America: The Winter Soldier with the comedic Guardians of the Galaxy, the MonsterVerse has taken a tonal shift between projects, and it DOES keep it fresh. The humans are the silliest part: a mismatched, ragtag, ill-prepared team that manages to assist Kong. The characters are cutout stereotypes: the scientist mother who can't help her child; the goofy 80s throwback charming ex, the comedic bling-covered nerd who talks his way into the mission and is terrified of everything, and the unfriendly pilot with the Scottish burr. Their mission is to escort a teen girl who is mute, the ""last of her kind,"" and somehow in telepathic contact with someone.The title is a misnomer, since Godzilla has far, far less screen time than Kong and adds very little to the plot other than being first a barrier and then an aid in the main story. His own character journey basically follows his day between naps.The journey of Kong to find family is touching but predictable. The behaviors of the chief bad guy are drawn from the ""Dummies Guide to Villainous Tropes."" Kong gets a companion, who is basically Scrappy Kong.But, of course, everyone comes to a MonsterVerse movie to see the monsters mix it up, and this film delivers. The fights are fun, well-staged, and filled with impressive CGI effects. Nothing new, but fun to watch.A fun film to watch on a big screen, if you aren't looking for anything to engage your mind.",6
"""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" delivers the monstrous mayhem fans crave","""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" delivers the monstrous mayhem fans crave. The CGI is top-notch, bringing the titans to life in all their atomic-breathed, skyscraper-stomping glory. The fight sequences are epic, but sometimes too short, reminding me of ""Godzilla: Final Wars"" at times.However, there's a growing sense that the MonsterVerse is venturing into familiar territory. The plot, while serviceable, recycles the ""threat to humanity"" trope, this time with a mysterious entity from the depths of the Earth.This is where we start to see the ""Avengers-ification"" of the MonsterVerse become apparent. There's a sense of setting the stage for a bigger baddie down the line, a cosmic kaiju Thanos ready to snap his irradiated fingers.While there's nothing wrong with a good old-fashioned brawl between giant lizards and apes, one can't help but wonder if the MonsterVerse is losing its unique charm. So, should you see Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire? Absolutely! It's a popcorn-munching extravaganza with enough city-crushing action to satisfy even the most jaded kaiju fan. Just be prepared for a familiar formula with a hint of what might be coming next.",6
Better than thought!,"Going into this movie, I wasn't expecting much. I just thought ""oh, another Godzilla and Kong movie."" But to my surprise this was actually a lot better than I thought. The plot line was interesting and actually went well with the movie. It kept me invested in the movie the whole time. There was definitely a lot to be left wanting in the movie but for someone who was on the fence about going in the first place, I was actually pretty surprised. Did this movie live up to Godzilla minus one? No, but it didn't need to. Two different movies. I like the fact that there was action, comedy, and at times drama. I would recommend this movie to someone who was a long or Godzilla fan.",7
I've watched 20 mins so far...,"... and I'm just not impressed. The film is too bright and too pink. Godzilla 2014 set the right tone; it was serious stuff. Skull Island, whilst not brilliant was still better than this. King Kong (2005) had less impressive but not immersive SFX. Godzilla (1998) was more enjoyable, with better characters and bonus spot the Simpsons voice actor material.This just isn't good and I'm wondering if I can even be bothered to watch the rest of it. I'm not sure what they've done differently with the SFX but the idea is that no matter how ridiculous, it's supposed to still look realistic, and this doesn't. It looks like a game, which appears to have been the intention of the creators.I don't really like anything about this film. It is inferior to every monster verse movie in every way possible. Kong is no longer an ape but some anthropomorphised upright humanoid and none of the human tech looks remotely realistic. None of it is good and I hate the creators and director for making some Planet Of The Apes with dragons rubbish instead of a proper monster movie for grown-ups.",4
HERE ARE SOME POINTS I NOTED DOWN FROM MOVIE,"Big fight coming! Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire is not another monstah smash movie, it's like the biggest, best part of the whole MonsterVerse story. Here's why you gotta see it:This is Just the Beginning! Director Wingard says The New Empire is only the first part of a much bigger story. People are saying there might be new monsters and even team-ups between them! Being there for this big moment in the MonsterVerse is something you don't want to miss.Here are some points which I summarized for you from movies.1. AWARD WINNING VISUALS! Remember how amazing Godzilla 2014 looked? The New Empire is even better! Director Adam Wingard, famous for how careful he is with details, promises a movie that looks more real than anything else. Think crazy special effects mixed with giant monster suits, making you feel like you're right there.2. Monsters Get Smarter! This new movie isn't just about a bigger fight, it's about smarter fighting. Godzilla and Kong learned new things since their last rumble. Godzilla, now king of all the monsters, has a super strong atomic breath and knows how to fight better. Kong found a new home underground with other cool monsters, and maybe even has special powers or weapons . The fight will be more strategic and surprising, keeping you guessing the whole time.3. Back to the Story! A lot of fans thought the MonsterVerse forgot about the people in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. The New Empire brings back the story of how regular people deal with these giant monsters. There are new heroes fighting to survive. This human part of the story makes us care more about the monsters and what's happening.4. Secret World Under the Ground! Before, we only heard rumors about a hidden place under the ground called Hollow Earth, where the monsters might come from. The New Empire takes us there! Imagine Kong showing us glowing caves with new creatures, maybe even enemies of Godzilla from way back! This underground world could change the whole MonsterVerse story.What should you do. Don't believe everything you hear right away. But the people making the movie are really good, and everyone is talking about how amazing it looks and the cool story ideas. The New Empire has a good chance of surprising you!So what do you want? A boring monster fight or to see the MonsterVerse become even bigger and better? Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire promises amazing pictures, a great story, and a whole new world for the monsters. This is a movie no monster fan, or anyone who likes giant monster fights, should miss!",9
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"It has to get at least three stars because it's got Dan Stevens (and his piercing eyes) in it. Otherwise, this is an entirely derivative and predictable effort that leaves nothing at all to our imagination. A truce has broken out since the last time (2021), with ""Kong"" ruling the roost deep in ""Hollow Earth""; ""Godzilla"" curled up asleep in the Coliseum and ""Ilene"" (Rebecca Hall) and the troubled ""Jia"" (Kaylee Hottle) keeping an eye on things for ""Monarch"" and mankind. ""Kong"" has a bad tooth so he comes to the humans for help. Fortunately, ""Trapper"" (the aforementioned DS) is a dab hand at grand-scale dentistry but it's while the ape is topside that alarm bells go off. ""Godzilla"" starts marauding again and an undiscovered vortex in the nether world requires investigation by ""Kong"" and his human pals. With ""Bernie"" (Brian Tyree Henry) back in the gang, off they all go to discover that a new menace has arrived, destroyed their monitoring outpost and it is now setting up a battle royal with just about every Titan left on Earth - above or below. Adam Winyard does just about everything on this film, and that shows in a complete lack of objectivity when evaluating this third rate adventure, the banal writing and equally lacklustre acting. It's as plain as the nose on your face why ""Godzilla' - who doesn't feature so much in this - is collecting energy, and when we do eventually get to them, the combat scenes are repetitive and too tightly choreographed. The scale is all over the place too. At times ""Kong"" appears the size of an house, at others he's more like a mouse. The visual effects are put to good use, but Hall just underwhelms, Henry talks way too much and Stevens' busky humour just doesn't hit home at all. I know it's difficult to keep coming up with new ideas for this genre and it must be difficult for the actors to constantly engage with nothing but some greenscreen, but the story is thin and the film reminds you of just about everything from ""Jurassic Park"" to episodes of ""Stargate"". It does need a big screen, though. On television it will be even more forgettable - but I did like the moth.",6
This is Son of Kong and it's terrible.,"I was hoping to be mildly entertained by this movie, but wow, was I disappointed in so many ways.Why have Godzilla in the title when this is obviously a Son of Kong movie made by Kong fanboy Adam Wingard?They said this was a throwback to the Showa era of Godzilla movies. Didn't they realize that even Toho thought a lot of the Showa movies were crap and wanted to retire Godzilla for a while until someone could create something that wasn't pure garbage?I hope if there is another Legendary kaiju movie, they let someone else other than Adam Wingard to direct it. And for the love of all things: Get rid of the stupid Marvel team up plots. They aren't working for Marvel anymore, and they definitely won't work for a Kong movie featuring 8 minutes of a now pink Godzilla.",1
Why do you want to watch this movie?,"The experience of Titans. Godzilla and Kong's screen presence and many goosebumps moment. Experience the movie in nearby theatres. In this film they showed the Titans life so don't worry about the any lag in the movie the movie was going smooth from start to end.Watch it on theatres experience in theatres only don't waste the movie by watching it on ott.The technicians had worked a lot.The movie greater than Godzilla vs Kong
The screen presence and the fights between the Titans were fabulous and had a great experience by watching it on 3d. Loved it. Experience the movie in theatres I'm not gonna spoil it here.",10
"If you want a human masterpiece, go watch Nolan's movies, this is Titan show!","I can honestly understand if so many people think this movie is lame and give it 1 star, but honestly once it is monsters, you don't expect logic or etc!!I am a fan of Godzilla and if even it shows up in the moon i will love it!But I truly believe that it still could have much more better plot!The writers seem to struggle creating a story and quickly get to the point!It could be much more better, with a very interesting story. There could have been much more interesting monsters to put in it rather than a scar-faced monkey!We had Kidora's head in ending scene of previous episode, so they could create an interesting story about it but they chose to make Godzilla and kong friends so that they could bring them back against other monsters in future and continue the Godzilla story line!Still I say as a fan I would give it 6 but if I was not a fan it would get 3!Let me not to forget to say about its amazing graphics but also lame custom design!",6
Strap in and prepare to feel nothing,"So bad it's hilarious, but probably only if you're smart enough to get stoned beforehand. The characters aren't likeable, funny, or entertaining. Monster fight after monster fight but mostly unsatisfying. Certainly causes some whiplash from the amount of back and forth between Godzilla, Kong, Humans, etc. Nothing really feels like it's on the line and there's such a lack of actual tension. Dialogue doesn't add anything to the movie except explanation. The characters feel like fluff with little to no value added to this movie. If you don't take anything seriously and don't care how bad it is, it can be pretty funny.",4
"Yeah, yeah. Just mark this review unhelpful and continue scrolling.","I just came back from watching Godzilla x Kong from the theatres. It is exactly what it was promised - there's no strong plot. Just action, because that's what we're here for. And yes, Godzilla and Kong also fight for a brief moment, but I will keep this review spoiler free.Like many people have already said here, Godzilla only appears for a small time. You know like those anime where the hero's rival is shown to be on his own adventure doing his own little quest, until the hero calls him? That rival here is Godzilla, while the hero is Kong. And I mean that literally. Kong is the one who travels around Middle Earth and discovers an enslaved giant gorilla civilisation being ruled by an evil Skar King. He has also enslaved Shimo, a four-footed ice version of Godzilla who is being mind controlled by Skar King to threaten any gorilla that dares to oppose him.Unlike what most people are saying here, I actually thought the human plot was pretty good this time around. There was less talking and more action. I also didn't mind the lack of story because let's be real, who goes to watch a movie of this franchise expecting a story anyway?My problem was with the departure of the POV that was in the first movies. If you watch the 2014 Godzilla, you will see that the camera angle makes you feel like you're in Godzilla's world. You don't see the world from Godzilla's perspective, you see Godzilla from the world's perspective. And that's what made Godzilla feel so big and scary. Same goes with King of the Monsters. Here, however, the middle earth is seen from the perspective of Kong himself. Because of this, everything doesn't appear as gigantic as it is supposed to be. It just feels like a normal gorilla roaming around the forest.Another problem was with the lack of 3D effects. I watched the movie in 3D, but there were barely any things that felt worth it. The title screen looked good, but that's about it. And no, my seating place wasn't a problem because I was sitting in the last row, so everything felt like actual creatures behind the screen. That effect was good, but the times the movie tries to make Godzilla or Kong lunge at the screen fails to make it believe that they will fall on you.",7
Godzilla vs Kong 2: Electric Bogaloo,"Maybe I enjoyed it more because my expectations were lowered by the last one. Went from Godzilla being kinda dark and gritty > Skull Island being less > King of the Monsters being somewhere in between > SyFy presents Godzilla vs Kong which really really really... really was unsatisfying.So coming to this I was expecting nothing and what I got was a movie I'd gladly leave on in the background while doing chores and not paying attention to anything. Which. I mean compared to what we've been getting? At least it wasn't trying too hard to satisfy multiple angles. It was unapologetically ""giant lizard sucks up power while giant ape investigates the center of the earth with help of deaf/psychic kid and friends"" and ends up ""giant lizard gets pink swole and helps giant ape with new robot fist defeat crazy giant chimp who enslaved giant ape's long lost family and also the giant moth comes back because ancient astronaut theorists were almost not wrong about an advanced civilization that harnessed mysterious powers to build the pyramids and foretold the coming of the psychic deaf kid who woke it up from being dead in the last movie by the science magic of sparkly dust.""",7
Decent enough,"You get what you expect from this film, especially if you've seen the previous instalments in the franchise.There is some exciting monster action, that can't be denied. It perhaps takes a little long to get stuck into this and there should definitely have been more, but when we get it it is pretty good. It maybe feels a little similar to the previous film though. I think if this franchise wants to move forward it needs to find a way to shake things up a bit and try to reinvent itself.The human side of things, as ever, is where this film gets let down. There is some half decent monster mythology that gets explored, but really the humans only exist to progress the monster action. That would be fine but they dwell on the human side of things for too long. Either develop the characters and the story lines or just dramatically reduce the human characters screen time. This film makes us spend a little too much time with them for me with very little reward.Overall though this film is a decent bit of fun. I don't think it's as good as Godzilla vs Kong, but it just about does the job.",6
Fans might have fun -- and then forget that they did,"Godzilla and King Kong unite once again to fight a common kaiju enemy in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. Booms and pows ensue. If that's all you need, close this window.As I've noted before, I'm detecting a pattern in the way Godzilla sequels (d)evolve. Back in the day, we began with a powerful post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki dirge in the form of 1954's Godzilla -- originally named Gojira in Japan and later needlessly retooled for American viewers -- and before you knew it, the once-terrifying titular beast (who had seemed so large and imposing a few movies ago) was sliding forth on his tail and drop-kicking his ""enemy of the week"" in flicks that later became Mystery Science Theater subjects.And now, decades later, we have the Monsterverse, which started out with 9/11-esque images of horror and has now culminated in a kaiju wrestling match where a big ape rides upon a big lizard to go fight another ape on another lizard. To make things funnier, the Japanese seem to have come full circle and returned to making Godzilla films that are deep and resonant -- using the monster as a ""ghost of World War II"" as Ebert once put it -- in the form of the phenomenal, Oscar-winning Godzilla Minus One.Following the release of that film, it's hard to accept the defense that Godzilla x Kong is ""just a monster movie"" and that it doesn't make sense to expect more from it than ""monsters punching each other"". I'm afraid we've all seen the truth; we know we could be getting more.But never mind what I would like to see from the kaiju genre. How does Godzilla x Kong fare as a monster brawl? Well, now's the time to tell you that my issue isn't that it's inherently wrong to opt for mindless fun over trying to achieve thematic resonance through more grounded action -- it's that the attempt at mindless monster fun isn't that great.I suppose it delivers what you came for, even as we waste some time on stupid prophecy nonsense and questionable interludes of cuteness (there's a scene where King Kong basically goes to the dentist). As for the battles themselves, they're no doubt well-made but they left me in a state of ""so what"". That's part of why it's hard for me to not compare it to its direct franchise predecessor:Yes, sometimes simians clobbering reptiles is enough. But imagine these fight scenes if we also cared and there was emotional gravity to the action -- or even regular gravity. Better yet, what if they leaned further into a Toho sequel homage and didn't seem to genuinely think King Kong floating around with a magical axe in Hollow Earth is epic and cool? As is, I can feel myself starting to forget most of what I saw in here. Was the axe even magical?Something I did like about the previous film, Godzilla vs. Kong, is Adam Wingard's direction. Even as the human characters in these films still aren't anything to cheer for (although I thought the human drama worked fine in the early bits of the 2014 original, and last year's Monarch: Legacy of Monsters partly warmed me up to the idea of learning more about the homo sapien side of the lore), Wingard at least made the GvK dialogue scenes look great -- atmospheric, prismatic, and bathed in ""line of purples"" neon. Here, we get similarly colorful sequences, yet they do very little to make the material more interesting.I understand if I sound too demanding or even ""spoiled"". It's worth reminding oneself what an amazing age of F/X we live in and how doubly amazing it must be for the OG nerds. Imagine watching 1933's original King Kong or any of the Ray Harryhausen classics as a kid -- not to mention that film from 1962 where a massively re-sized Kong finally did meet Godzilla, both played by actors in shoddy suits. Could you ever have dreamed that we'd one day see movies -- spectacles -- like the ones we have now?If you were that kid, I guess you shouldn't let me stop you -- even as you might have nitpicks of your own regarding lore or whether the monsters should really move like this (especially considering the sense of scale and weight that Gareth Edwards gave to these things when this particular 'verse was established). I do think you should go see it; I cannot promise you will remember much about it. I think you might have fun; I also think Godzilla himself, being a recent Oscar winner and all, deserves more.Regardless: Happy 70th, Godzilla. May you either evoke the horrors of man-made annihilation or brofist a photo-realistic Gamera in whatever's next. Either way, we'll be seated.",4
A great monter movie but must change for the next movie!,"Pros:
There are some sequences remind me of parts of the franchise, great tribute.They build the character of the titanus good enough to make them interesting to watch even without humans. For a monster movie like this, we don't care much about humans so instead of building strong characteristics for humans, they build strong characteristics for the kaijus! Especially The Scar King is so smart and evil, almost feel like he is a human.This is a true monster movie with many monsters timing and less humans on it, and still makes the watchers understand without subtitles! The most monters screen-time of the franchise ever.The best part of the movie is the hollow earth battle between the 4.At some sequences, Scar King, Shimo looks so gigantic and cool, which makes the whole audience awe in superised and interesting.Cos:
Please change the style! Sorry for the Director and film crew but this style is getting boring and unfitted to Godzilla franchise. It looks superficial. Bring it back to 2019 style where monsters feel like monsters.The film doesn't show the mega heavy sizes of kaijus, they move very fast, at some sequences, their skins look like wax. The color grading in Hollow Earth is very natural but in the earth's world looks opposite.The final battle is predicted and has zero climax, they easily win without a plot twist which the franchise did very well in all 4 previous films (especially 2019)Too many background music! Overusing music, I feel like 90% of the scenes have music on it, which makes viewers feel like they are watching a music video, not a movie. A good movie must makes the watchers feel like they are INTO that world of film, and to make that, the film should have more 1-perspective view, more one shots, less cuts and less BG music, just voices and ambient sound (like natural sound).",8
"Average, long but if your bored its okay","Godzilla X Kong... It was a long sit after all.Positive: small kong, fights animals, some good jokes from the discord guy (somebody did write it had guardians of galaxy Vibes... It is also not that funny.. however it was fine), the dentist guy had a nice touch to it, a lot happens, the pilot.Negative; female lead actrice (uch.. awful), the kid, deaf language, bad kong, bad gonzilla, the script (first 30mins awful without any sense or soul), way to much green screen scenes (90%?), the tribe, movie has no soul or purpose, felt like a 3hour movie, whole underworld was a bit cheesy and to perfect.. bring in soms darkness and raw jungle vibes..Sometimes I wonder why producers can not make a better movie then the orginial king kong from over 30 years ago!!They should or make this movie way more funnier and focus on humor or make this movie way more darker and raw. Now it is a bit of nothing.All by all... 5,5.. which makes it a 6.",6
"Turn your brain back on, and leave the theater with what's left of your neurons.","When exactly everyone lowered their basic standards to underground levels? Tell Bryan Cranston's dying wife that the world will be safe because a giant super hero monkey with a transformers arm will team up with a caped crusder lizard to kung fu fight monsters, and the earth is hollow and has a giant monkey city in it, then come back and tell me how well that fits together as part of the same ""universe"". ""Monkey hits lizard, good , don't say otherwise or me throw poop at you!"" If that's your level of intelligence you will love it, but don't watch it or you will get worse. Please don't defend this movie by asking us to ""TURN OUR BRAIN OFF"", if that's your defense you already lost the deabate, why don't you ask the writers to turn their brain on? ""FUN"" is not synonymous of ""STUPID"", it wasn't, it doesn't have to be, and we already passed that, oh that's right ""-1"" wasn't Hollywood... here we go again... OF COURSE ITS FAIR TO COMPARE IT WITH ""-1"", every movie with dinosaurs is still compared to Jurassic Park, people can compare it with Barbie or the Smurfs if they want, but this one doesn't even stand a comparison with GODZILLA 2014 which is part of the NOT MARVEL ""universe"" it belongs, and its the one has to be mandatory compared to. Don't turn off your brain for Hollywood again, enough is enough. This movie is to GODZILLA 2014 what BATMAN AND ROBIN was to BATMAN 1989 AND BATMAN RETURNS or what Moonraker was to James Bond. They started as something believable and serious and someone else turned them later into goofy cartoons. Being a fan of GODZILLA and tokusatsu cinema and tv doesn't mean that I cannot distinguish quality from trash, and as a healthy fan I always want QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY, I don't consume and blindly deffend everything because it says ""Godzilla"" on it. Yes, the Showa era exists, Toho is embarrased of it, any fan knows that, do you? They consider it as the lowest point of the franchise and that's why Godzilla has never been that goofy; at least in Japan, ever since. BUT This is NOT a Showa era Godzilla movie, its supposed ti part of the serious american Godzilla 2014 version, which exists because the American 1998 version was so terrible and goofy that they decided to scratch all sequels and reboot it in a serious direction with the 2014 version. But 1998's was more believable than this new one, why is 1998 not equaly praised? The Showa era; as goofy as it was, was its OWN thing(mess) separatted from the original's canon, Godzilla has been reseted in Japan at least 3 times, but this ultra goofy american cartoon is NOT its own thing, it is supposed to be a CONTINUATION of a movie where Bryan Cranston, crying with a broken soul, had to sacrifice his wife and colleagues to save the city and his son, and he had to say goodbye while she was dying in front of him, a movie where they tried to give weight and REALISM to a creature of more than 300m height and thousands of tons in weight, where they tried to put on screen the consequences of its destruction and existence in the REAL world. That was the selling point, realism, that was what was promised to the fans, it delivered that promise but not as well as GODZILLA-1 did, yet it was a stept on the right direction, how did we get from that 2014 movie to this? How is that a progress? Goofy movies are fun and have their space in cinema, a bigger place than what they deserve, no doubt of that, I love ""so bad are good movies"" as much as the next man BUT.....BUT.....but I repeat, that is when they ARE THEIR OWN THING and not a continuation of something that was relatively realistic and serious. And this one goes an extra mille triplying down with stupidity which makes it insulting to even kids intellligence. After so many times complaining about studios telling us to ""turn off our brain"" when did you, the raging fans decided to obey and celebrate that? Have some integrity! GODZILLA-1 and everything from Nolan prove that movies can be intelligent and entertaining at the same time again, no excuse! Specially GODZILLA-1 reminded us 4 important things:
1 - You can have an intelligent, engaging, and even inspiring story and visual spectacle at the same time. Thay they cannot exist together is an old lazy writers' lie.2 - People do like human characters, when they are well writen and important for the plot. These movies dont work without them, they are the ones that suffer the consequences of the destruction and as the audirnce we need that.3 - Millions of dollars on visual efects are worth nothing if points 1 and 2 are not checked.4 - Not everything has to ripp off of MARVEL.If you are a filmmaker who loves bad dumb movies create your own franchise and quit destroying others with continuations that are not even part of the same genre! Does Jar Jar Binks fits in The Godfather's ""universe"" (everything has to be called a universe now, thanks to Marvel)? Cake on face jokes? I didn't think so neither.IF you as most fans have complained of movies for being shallow, dumb and for treating the audience as ""stupid cattle"", but you deffend this movie precisely for being all that, don't you dare to trash Batman and Robin, Transformers, anything from Michael Bay, Uwe Boll, Fast and Furious, Jurassic World, sharknado, Birdemic, The Room, again, because that's called DOUBLE STANDARDS. TURN YOUR BRAIN BACK ON. This movie is terrible and that's NOT A GOOD THING.",1
"If you love big creatures fighting, you're good to go!","The movie itself is gorgeous with its visual effects. The fight scenes are entertaining and the destruction of the locations the fights take place are quite remarkable.It is very important to say that if your last kaiju movie is one of the dramatic ones such as Godzilla Minus One, and you're going to watch this with expectations matching that movie, you WILL be underwhelmed by this. This is an ACTION movie, not horror, not drama. It is a movie that focuses on the action above all else.The human characters, much like the other Legendary titles, are unfortunately quite unnecessary and frankly, it really feels like the movie wouldn't change a bit if the scenes involving the human characters were cut off, though the one in KoTM and the first KvG are still worse.So, if you love big creatures fighting each other and causing havoc in notorious places (and in Hollow Earth) then go watch it! You will have a good time!",8
Big clichés but great fight,"When watching 'Godzilla vs. Kong 2,' I generally consider the film to be cliché. It doesn't have any distinct features that set it apart from similar movies. The film seems to be written with only the second half in mind, almost completely neglecting the first half. The first part is very weak in terms of story development, so I'm giving it just 4 points. The second half, however, is quite successful and exciting in terms of action, and I don't hesitate to give it 7 points, although I must mention some absurd scenes. Overall, the film leaves an average impression and deserves a total score of 6/10. The battle of the giant monsters is a fantastic subject for me. I always watch it breathlessly. The action scenes are truly impressive; no complaints there. However, the clichés commonly found in big-budget films can become tiresome at times. I think there are points where the film could have utilized its potential better and offered a more original story. If more creative risks were taken and there was deeper character development and script enhancement, it could provide a more satisfying experience for fans of this genre. As it stands, 'Godzilla vs. Kong 2,' while delivering the expected grand clash, stays only on the surface in terms of storytelling and character development.",6
BRING BACK THE OLD DIRECTORS IN THE FIRST 3 FILMS,"Remaking my review have alot more to say-- my good review is at the bottom --First of all, what that actual earth is going on..
I'm astonished to see such high ratings. The whole movie script is poo.Firstly, the cgi at some parts were terrible, and I felt like that there was more Kong then godzilla.. I don't know but that's what I thought. The whole storyline is so ""What on earth is happening"", in a way I sort of saw what they was trying to aim st here but it just kept dragging and dragging till the end, the ending was so rushed. Scar King didn't really apper till midway of the movie and at first I was like he's hella scary but at the end I was like he's so useless without thst crystal thing he uses to control shimo as his personal defense system 🤣😭 like what. Poor shimo bless her, she got treated like poo and again she didn't have so much of a role even tho she should have, she just got mainly controlled.The other monsters in the movie that godzilla fault, thst was all SO poor. At one point they kept cutting out the death of the other titans when they fought godzilla and Kong. They were pretty much useless kinda.I love monster verse films but this is on a another level. I don't know what they could make after this, that's if they even do. The whole storyline is bugged up. I don't get hoe they can just randomly create a new world more like life under the earth and just random portals to get in and out. Sorry didn't know I entered Harry Potter..Suko I think his name is the lil ape was so cute though, bless his father, that scar king was a poo for killing him off like that, my heart actually went for him.. Kong was so sweet to him as well.Anyways, the movie was partly decent but it could have done better if rhey slowed it down a bit and not rushed it !!Oh and also mothra, what- how did she just get summoned like that. Not gonna question but she was pretty cool as well but yeahh.",1
The best kind of popcorn entertainment,"If one goes to see this movie expecting depth, emotion and ""real cinema"", that person will be dissapointed. If one goes to see this movie expecting wacky fun and over-the-top action then you will come out of the theater with a big smile on your face.The movie has its issues like with the presence of human characters which can be a tad bit boring but the problem of human characters is less apparent than with the last movie 'Godzilla vs. Kong'.Kong is in the focus and can be considered the main protagonist but Godzilla still gets a few awesome scenes. The relationship between the two main characters is strangely very interesting and is well explored with this movie and the last one too even though they are both computer generated.",7
Classic Action,"Story - 2/10 pros/cons: absurd concept and story, but that's part of the charm of this action romp.Cast - 8/10 pros: Hall and Henry lead a charismatic cast that help push the scenes between the amazing action. Stevens provides some fun lighthearted comic relief to the over dramatized stakes of the movie. Cons: characters are pretty generically written.Direction - 7.5/10 pros: Wingard creates some lavish action sequences and overall creates a fun light airy tone to the film, taking some creative inspiration from the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. Cons: the story was the least important part of this movie, but Wingard really tried to push the story and the total run time was probably 20 minutes too long because of this.Pace - 6/10 pros: the movie moves between action sequences at a strong pace. Again the fights and action are the true star of this movie. Cons: there are a few too many unnecessary character development stories interwoven between the fights.Atmosphere - 8/10 pros: the world is fun. The action is amazing. The special effects are pretty stunning. Cons: the main strength of the film was the atmosphere, which is a strength for the atmosphere but a negative for an overall movie and story.Overall Score 6 out of 10, very fun movie and would recommend but not a classic or quite up to the previous movies in this franchise.",6
Entertaining for now.,"The latest addition to the Monsterverse is quite entertaining. However, I wonder how long these movies can continue to be released without becoming too repetitive.The movie's plot revolves around Kong living in the Hollow Earth, while Godzilla is busy fighting Titans on the surface.The returning human characters include Bernie (played by Brian Tyree Henry), Dr. Andrews (played by Rebecca Hall), her daughter Jia, and some exciting new additions such as Trapper (played by Dan Stevens).The visual effects remain impressive, with incredible scale.While I hope to see more from this universe, I would love to see some unique ideas and better-developed human characters.",6
Worst in the series,"Just graphics.. nothing else. Screenplay is dead. You cannot connect with any characters. Monsters show emotions and fight like humans.. may be children under 8 can enjoy. Not for adults.This not even come close the Godzilla -1 or Even the previous installation of this legendary movies.Most of the good actors are avoided because of. $$$ .. and as a result they get this crap movie , where an adult cannot invest or connect. No emotions when Godzilla appears.These Hollywood directors should see Godzilla -1 .. you don't need super graphics or lot of monster scenes .. it's the buildup that is important.",1
"All that i was looking for, kinda","This movie pretty much over-exceeded my expectations. Because i knew from the trailer that it would be «over the top». But as a fan of godzilla and kong they did a really good job. It was really entertaining, I didn't want the movie to end. I would've given it 10 stars if it wasn't for too much focus on the humans. They kind of killed my vibe. I'd rather watch kong punch a wall for 25 minutes than watch this iwi girl that doesnt speak be the hero in this film. For future movies, even if there is one, i would love to keep the directors from pushing this stupid story about some iwi kid. I want to see monsters fighting. Thanks.",9
It was okay,Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is WB's 70th year in its franchise. This film was less about Godzilla and more about Kong. Godzilla had only eight minutes of screen time and the storyline surrounded Kong as he is aging. He is longing to find more of his kind and somehow there is a portal to hollow earth where all sorts of prehistoric creatures exist much like the show Brea. Kong finds himself not alone but cannot find his place amongst his own kind. He ends up fighting battles against Skar the Gorilla while Godzilla is helping humanity fight against titans. The two team up to destroy Skar and bring order to his new kingdom. Kong represented the good in humanity while Skar was the worst part of human habits and cruelty. Besides all the CGI and all the monstrous roars were overpowering the movie just too much with less human involvement. Rebecca Hall acted as a head of Monarch while her adopted daughter who is played by Kaylee Hottle is trying to find her place in her world. Brian Tyree Henry is the only person that reprised his role from the previous film. Alex Ferns played a military officer much like his character from Andor. Dan Steven's acted as Trapper an 80's type character in a style like a G. I. Joe figure. Overall it was an okay movie with a good premise but I wouldn't watch it.,7
Worst movie. Not up to the expectations. Waste of money.,"Watched in IMAX 3D, gotta say, movie is not up to the mark. Boring plot. Some scenes are good featuring kong. Rest is just pathetic, And please remove all humans from these movies, Their stories really sucks. Action scenes are OK, teaming up kong and godzilla seems like WTF, not convincing at all. Story of iwi tribe and the girl seems so forceful and really take audience intrest away from the movie. It would be far more better if do not show humans at all in the movie. Through out the movie I was expecting something interesting will come but it completely disappoints. Overall it's not up to the expectations.",2
"I Was having Low Expectations, and I was Wrong.","This film, is basically Showa Era In CGI, and this was still good, humans were kinda meh, Godzilla was barely there and you can clearly tell Kong is now the main character.Warning: SpoilersMothra's entry was not explained much, it's kinda like
""Mothra has been revived and she will fight with Godzilla again"" There's not really that much build up.Skar King is my favourite MonsterVerse villain so far. Shimo was a Powerful Woman.Scylla was killed way too early. Same with Tiamat.Where's Maddison? I'm just asking.There are 3 new monsters in this but I'm not gonna explain them.Overall, 2nd favourite MonsterVerse Film.Go watch it if you haven't.",8
Too many humans,"This film would have been great if there were no humans in it. They are just there to react to stuff. The ending was also very abrupt, it had a lot of potential. The visuals were stunning, same for the cgi. In my opinion, kong shouldn't be here, it should just be a Godzilla film. Scar King didn't do nearly enough to warrant being a scary villain. Shimo was also spoilt very early on which ruined the surprise. Mothra should have been in it from the start or set up earlier. Godzilla's new design is a great reference to the Heisei era (very cool) Overall, the film was underwhelming and minus one was better.",7
What a horrible dumpster fire,"Less than mediocre monster movie with terrible visual effects. The story is absolutely stupid and the ending is obvious halfway through the movie. The ultimate monster fight is anticlimactic and dull. The writing is lazy. I can't even come up with 600 words to tell you why you shouldn't waste any money on this movie. Its not even a good summer popcorn movie. Its not fun, its not cool. Kong even has a hero's journey ffs and needs a damned powerfist and help from pink Godzilla and Frozen Godzilla to get the job done. The ending doesn't even jibe with the lore revealed in the movie. Watch this at home and don't waste any money.",3
A bit too long....,"The movie was pretty action packed.... along with some plot mishaps and ""deus ex machina"" moments. CGI effects were top notch although I felt that some of the actual human acting was poorly done at best.Some of the actions of both Godzilla and the humans on the surface contradicted their actions over the past two movies. It just seem contrived and out of place.The movie was okay just about 30 minutes too long. I doubt that I would watch it again, either at the theater or at home. I think the problem was at times it bored me with the disjointed plot and the titan fights that occurred off screen.",7
"Some good Kaiju fighting fun. Nothing more, nothing less.","One of the best things about Godzilla vs. Kong (2021) is that Godzilla and Kong both had actual personalities which elevated the movie above your average mindless Kaiju flick.Unfortunately, this is where Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (2024) comes in short. While Kong is given a decent character arc in the film, Godzilla more or less gets shoved off to the sidelines this time around. One thing that's also missing from the previous Godzilla vs. Kong is the scale where the destruction and mayhem caused by the rampaging Kaiju monsters don't have nearly the same level of impact as in the previous movie, probably because a number of fight scenes take place in Hollow Earth instead of in one of the Earth's cities.Aside from that, ""The New Empire"" still succeeds at being a pretty entertaining Kaiju flick with a satisfying amount of action-filled monster bashing.",7
fun and exciting,"After releasing trash after trash, (with exceptions) the movie industry finally blessed us with a good film. Dont get me wrong, its definitely not the deepest storyline, and there are issues, but its pretty fun regardless. The action is by far the best part of the film, both godzilla, kong, and scar king look amazing. The other titans are okay, and they manage to tell a story through multiple characters which cant even speak, which i would say is a win.For some criticism, i will say that the sizing was kind of inconsistent, like sometimes kong looks smaller than in other scenes, etc. Etc. But its not often. Also i do think that a lot of the plot points were kind of ehhh like convenient i guess? But overall good movie.",7
Humanity is boned if these people are the best of us.,"With a story plot so bad that you feel that the 11,000 plus people who died in just Rio De Janeiroin alone it were the lucky ones.The obvious cast of DEI (Also know as, cheap unskilled labour in Hollywood) hires include horrible single mum how has 2 PHDs, time to run Monarch despite not being the boss all while not caring for her daughter and insults her deaf (along withe the audience, repeatedly) by saying she is perfect, no one with a disability wants to keep their disability. The daughter who comes along to one of the most dangerous places known to man and her bad mum is like, ok, and is now psychic saviour from an old prophecy. A vetinarian that would of failed veterinarian school and is somehow also a pilot because the token while male is filled with anger and won't listen to the DEI hires so they fed him to a tree. The token black friend who was brought on becuase they ""think outside the box"" but only films everything for his podcast. Oh and token white guy who is a rage filled, stuck up, stuburn pilot because that what the DEI writers think all white people are.In the end I half expected dinosaurs to pop up since the story (and humans) were so bad. But, like the story, I was thoroughly disappointed. The human free cut when it comes out will be a little better to watch.",2
Honest review,"""Godzilla vs. Kong 2"" is one of the best movies of 2024. The narrative is impressive and stays true to the original Japanese comic. The idea of Kong facing his own kind and eventually liberating them is an unexpected and fascinating twist. The collaboration of Godzilla, Mothra, and the Ice Titan, along with spectacular action scenes in several major cities around the world, offers an impressive audiovisual spectacle. Additionally, there are hardly any dull moments, which enhances the movie. The improvements to Kong and his aged appearance make him even more realistic. As a fan of this saga, I can say they have done an excellent job in creating this title.",10
"Fight, Monsters, Fight !","It was fun to watch in the cinema. I thought the CGI was cool and good. I slept a little during part of the movie because probably I was so tired :) I think the movie does what is expected. Monster battle is also satisfying for those who want to watch the monster fight. Again, the people in this movie are boring. The acting wasn't bad. There will probably be a sequels of this series. It attracts my attention; it is fun and enjoyable to watch in the cinema. It was also enjoyable to watch because the CGI was good. Godzilla sleeping in Colosseum reminded me of my cat wanting to sleep wherever he wanted and made me laugh. King Kong was very cool. But Godzilla was much cooler.",6
3 stars for the monsters,"Why people have to make humans the most idiotic characters? One good argument is that it is an idiotic movie. I agree that it is, but it is what it is. I really liked to write those above phrases with a lot verb to be in the present.The humans could have been totally left aside on this movie. They bring nothing to the table, they are so pathetic that's beyond belief (not a rare thing these days in Hollywood movies).The cinematography is ok, the monsters are ok. But it's a souless movie. You don't care about anyone or anything. Turn your brain off and watch it when you just want to pass time.",3
Pretty Good,"Spoiler Heavy: I almost gave this a 10/10 just for that one scene where Kong picks up that little guy and starts using him as a weapon lmao. Sorry for the spoiler but that was so funny to me, in a good way.Other than that, yeah it's a CGI monster fest with less subtlety than 2014s just like how all the sequels have stripped away the subtle awesomeness of the first film in the current monsterverse. But there sure is a lot of action and once you accept the premise and suspend your disbelief it is definitely worth the time. It's very fun, doesn't take itself too seriously, and knows exactly what you want from the movie.Another great part is when Kong is trying to tell Godzilla to get in the hole and Godzilla just suplex him into the pyramids. Good times. And some kid in the theatre had the audacity to say that the movie was ""boring except for the last part"" at the end. If a 10 year olds attention can't be held by 2 hours of nonstop King Kong and Godzilla action then maybe our society truly is on the brink of disaster.Also at the end Kong truly becomes King, I see what they did there and I love it.",8
More of a Kong movie,"This is not a Godzilla movie. Comparing it to minus one is just not a good comparison. Minus one was a Godzilla movie. This is very much a Kong movie with a guess appearance of Mothra and Godzilla. Which is cool. He was pink which is new. But little to no time was spent on Godzilla fights with other monsters and in the final battle he is just more of an after thought then real player in the fight. For a Kong movie is was pretty decent. I like the exploring of his world and monkeys are fine, but the bad guy monkey was not intimidating. Wasn't a fair fight really. I felt like mecha Godzilla was the better bad guy in the last movie. Screen time was more even on the last one. Fight scenes lasted longer and better done. This one seemed rushed or badly edited. Maybe a smaller budget this time. Enjoyable movie, just take Godzilla out of the title as it's a Kong movie. Love seeing Mothra.",7
Hard to turn my brain off after Minus One,"How many monsterverse movies will it take for Legendary to understand we want more monster action and better human characters?!Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is the 5th entry in Legendary's Godzilla and Kong universe but like the movies that came before it, The New Empire has the SAME problems.None of the characters are memorable much less relatable and they still take up a lot of the runtime. Godzilla Minus One proves you can have a healthy balance of well-written human drama and kaiju conflict but Legendary prefers to take the turn-your-brain-off approach which doesn't work. There's so much exposition that even the characters had to guess what was happening in the movie itself because nothing made any sense.There are moments of uninterrupted fights between the Titans which are fun but they are few and far between. There are dozens of monsters from Toho's lineup at Legendary's disposal but instead, they opt to create an uninspired and not-so-menacing threat. At no point did I ever feel like anybody was in danger.Speaking of Godzilla, he was an afterthought for no apparent reason. I loved Kong's story and even the addition of Baby Kong had me more excited than any of the human elements of this story.The New Empire was a nonsensical slog that had some fun action scenes between monsters but offered nothing else. The script is contrived and the lack of Godzilla is criminal yet part of me hopes this franchise continues and improves.",5
"Mindless, dumb, fun and an overrall entertaining monster movie","Don't go into this movie expecting some Christopher Nolan level, compelling storytelling. This is a movie where you can go to turn off your brain and enjoy mindless monster action and fan service, and let me tell you, there's a LOT of fan service and I love it.GxK does have its narrative problems such as Jia's character arc, and... the plot.You know that one CGI shot of godzilla in the trailer after he awakens from the ice that everyone and their mother is talking about how bad the CGI is? Yeah, that stays the same, it's not some unfinished CGI, it's literally the final result, the official thing. But that's OK since it only lasts for a few seconds and in the next shot the CGI looks fantastic as usual.I wanted this to be more of a Godzilla movie, but I already know that it's going to be centred around kong before going into this movie because the trailer makes it obvious. Adam Wingard is a fan of Godzilla but GxK did not have a lot of godzilla. Well, there is, but kong gets way more screen time and he's the main character. This is definitely more of a Kong movie, not a Godzilla movie, but I'm okay with it and I hope the next one focuses and centres more around godzilla, or another kaiju that is not kong like Rodan, and oh let me tell you i would be celebrating if a Rodan centred storyline is announced.The human characters are likeable, and by human characters I mean only Trapper and Bernie. Jia in the beginning acts like the stereotypical, cliche lonely high school teenager who doesn't want to talk about her problems, avoids it as much as possible, and is the outcast who has, like, no friends, but that gets quickly overshadowed by the monsters (who have more screen time that ever), Trapper and Bernie. I'm glad they gave the monsters more screen time, it's more fun and entertaining. One of the humans will have a character arc and I'll just say that it could've been better.Enjoy this movie for what it is, what it's supposed to be, a dumb, fun monster movie with a ton of action, fan service, and lore.I'm wasn't sure what rating to give this movie but I settled on 6 so people can know that this is not Everything Everywhere All at Once, this is not The Dark Knight, this doesn't have any compelling storytelling. This is an entertaining monster movie that does what would make Michael Bay still successful if he just did this instead. Even though 6/10 is a bad rating I would highly recommend this movie for people who just want to see big monsters fight, and especially for godzilla fans, and I don't mean the people who think they know everything about godzilla and what every adaptation should be like just because they watched Minus One and liked it. No offense to Minus One fans because basically everyone who's seen the movie loves it. But I've seen critics compare this to Minus One which just doesn't sit right with me.",7
Fun movie although it has its problems,"The film itself is quite fun, the fight scenes between monsters really got me excited, however, the human characters in the film are most of the time very boring to follow, the script ends up forcing too much in several moments, for example, "" the chosen child."" Things that have never been mentioned before in the film appearing out of nowhere to solve a problem, which makes the script a bit lazy. I also think that Godzilla's character should have more scenes in the film, the work focuses a lot on Kong and Kodzila ends up not being shown as much, but it's worth highlighting considering that the main focus is on Kong and his kind. Apart from these points, the film is really fun, the fight scenes are great and very creative.",7
almost feel the same,"We all here for that titan fight that we promised will get right? Well if its that stuff we talking about, than this movie already doing their job. With outstanding way? No really, but its pretty good.Despite all the gigantic fight and the all out war, we kinda see through what the last fight are going to be. That's because this one really put obvious step by step fight process which i really can't tell was it good thing or the oposite.The rest, you gonna pretty much realize that the effort mostly go to the big guys, so the ""ground"" scene its self its hanging on the tip of ""what in the world do they plan to with the stories?""",6
a major disappointment,"This installment came out flat and stayed that way. The story isn't compelling and it's mostly built around Kong, not Godzilla, and the deaf child. She, of course, is precious but she can make up for only so many shortcomings.The CGI are great, so no one will be disappointed in Godzilla or Kong. Kong's new tormentor, another giant ape, wears a snake's spine wrapped around his shoulders as if a bandolier from a Mexican western. All he lacked was a sombrero. Dan Stevens, of Downton Abbey and Beauty and the Beast fame, is totally miscast as a Monarch veterinarian and rock music plays during some of his scenes that is nothing but distracting. And annoying.This movie tries to be too hip for its own good. It's the weakest of the Warner Bros./Legendary Godzilla movies. It has the unfortunate fate to follow one of the best Godzilla movies ever, Godzilla Minus One, and doesn't come close to capturing the same grace, beauty and storyline. I almost got up and walked out, which I have never done in Godzilla movie, but stayed with the King until the end....",5
"""You.Are.My.Home.""","The makers of this second journey of Kong, to the Hollow Earth, and Godzilla, from southern Europe to South America, to finally meet and team up to counter a clear and present danger to us all, have succeeded in instilling a heart and soul into the widespread use of computer-generated images.Jia, the young girl able to communicate with Kong through sign language, brilliantly played by deaf actress Kaylee Hottle, was the key force in the fourth installment of ""The MonsterVerse."" She remains the character who guides us here, too, in a formatted world to which she does not belong, before returning to her origins while helping Kong to fulfill his destiny with the help of powerful or touching new allies.I was lucky enough to be able to enjoy this roller coaster ride through the worlds of our Earth on a very big screen and I highly recommend it. It's a perfect family film, which will appeal to both young and old who have managed to keep a part of their child's soul. Tell me who didn't play like this with their toys when they were a kid - dreaming of what we can now discover on our screen!?If 'The New Empire' is as successful as expected, I hope that Legendary Pictures will produce another Godzilla-vs-Kong film of this quality in the years to come.",8
Big dumb and loud!,"GxK was a great time at the movies, so good I had to go and watch it twice! This movie isn't the smartest or most intelligent movie but it's definitely entertaining.The monsters are big loud and full of heart, the story doesn't slow at all it's full paced from the very start and doesn't let up!Kong is the heart of the story and he is the life of the story.Mothras return is an exciting one, and the human characters are the lest annoying of the franchise which is a bonus!This entry is up there with my favourite monster verse movies, it slots right behind Godzilla: King of the monsters as my fav!Very much looking forward to the next instalment.",7
What a horrible addition to this respected franchise. SKIP THIS ONE!,"What a horrible movie. I have no other way to put it. This film should get a Rotten Tomatoes score below fifty.I've read reviews saying the first Godzilla vs. King Kong movie was a movie about humans where some monsters occasionally showed up. This was a movie about humans and monsters acting like humans, and the only REAL monsters (no human characteristics) are rarely seen.GvK:TNE's story is seventy five percent about Kong, twenty percent about the human characters, and five percent about Godzilla. The movie itself is sixty five percent about the story, and thirty five percent about the special effects.Ninety percent of the Kong storyline is about humanizing the monster, and follows an all-too-worn out Hollywood trope that is used to humanize non-human characters, build sympathy in general, and create to build a bond with the audience. For me it did the opposite: it made me hate Kong and wish that Godzilla would completely devour him and end this pitiful series.The humans' story is equally Hollywood cheese. Of the four main characters, one is completely pointless (I think was supposed to be comic relief, but couldn't even do that), one is so shallow that we have no bond with them whatsoever, one is so predictable that you can almost quote their dialogue without having even seen the movie, and the other's story arc is predictable but well acted and sympathetic (and was ten or eleven years old when the movie was filmed, so kudos to Kaylee Hottle for outacting every single adult in the movie).I don't want to give away any story spoilers. Lets just say it is very predictable. It is sad how predictable Hollywood has become. Watching the movie, anytime you say to yourself, oh, I know what's going to happen... You will be correct. It will be exactly what you expect. There is not one unforeseen plot twist or surprise in the entire story. Not one.I live in Asia and watched this movie in a 4D theater. For those of you unfamiliar with 4D, it is a 3D movie with seats that move (up/down, pitch, yaw) and vibrate, air blows at you, water splashes in your face, there are over 100 scents that are released, and there are strobe lights in the theater. This is all to ""enhance"" the movie.Do you remember that scene from The Hobbit where the Dwarves, Galdalf, and Bilbo escape the elves in that river chase scene? That scene was created for one reason only: to show off the 3D capabilities and to make people who paid to watch the movie in 3D feel they got their money's worth. I honestly felt there were scenes in GvK:TNE that were shot just to take advantage of the 4D theaters. If you feel there are scenes that seem a little ... odd ... chances are something ""cool"" happened in the 4D theater (it wasn't that cool, trust me).",2
Big Match Kaiju,"A movie for anyone who wants a kaiju fight without human intervention, a monsterverse movie with the most kaiju screen time and featuring lots of Kaiju.Forget about anything and just enjoy the kaiju fight, really entertaining.Apart from Godzilla minus one which focuses on the human horror drama of Godzilla, Monsterverse presents a different Godzilla film, Monsterverse focuses on action adventure battles between monsters. Both are films with different presentation purposes so they cannot be compared. If you want to watch monster fights, watch Monsterverse. If you want a film that focuses on terror stories, monster dramas are Godzilla minus one.",10
Good movie But even can make more better.,"The movie is good. Watch it on IMAX for wonderful experience of seeing the titans in more better ways. Story wise can make much better and can be improved. They need to clearly concentrate on enemy side.Making the strong enemy and overcome from that trouble is more better then normal story. Skar king character can make more strong so while movie audiences will think how this titans gonna overcome this enemy. But in this we don't feel the strength of the skar king.Looks trailer shows skar king more dangerous but in movies that not.VFX, CGI are mind blowing.Don't miss this opportunity to watch on big screen kids really enjoy this very well.",7
Need more Godzilla screentime,This Godzilla x Kong feels more like a Kong film than a Godzilla film. And it's sad to see Godzilla being treated like a side character in his own film.I hope from next film onwards there would be a solo Godzilla movie that involves the actual titans not these stupid monkeys we got in the Gvk and Gxk.Godzilla can keep up with Shimo but almost lose to a monkey(Kong) just to please the western people is so pathetic.I was so excited for this movie and I watched it but I came with disappointment.We need Godzilla solo movie from now I hope this is the last movie that involves monkeys.Godzilla King of the Monsters is the best film followed by Minus one and Godzilla 2014.,1
About as expected,"Going into this movie you pretty much know what you're gonna get; which is a bunch of fantasy creatures or (kaiju) battling it out. The thing I like most about this movie is how little it takes itself seriously, and I'm glad it was this way. This movie is nothing like Godzilla minus one with the captivating characters of the movie and heartfelt scenes. The reason why it doesn't have to be like that is because it's just an action packed entertaining blast. This is the kind of movie that you can just have playing in the background and not have to really invest yourself into. In the film there is a lot of kaiju scenes which really is what made this movie. If you're not into fantasy creatures and colossal fight scenes then don't bother with this movie because the plot of the human characters is lackluster. Thankfully they show equally as much if not more of the kaiju then the humans which really redeemed this movie. Overall a fairly strong installment in the kaiju universe that's worth watching.",6
Curious George Saved the night,"The film stars ok, unfortunately it seems some time it gets lost and suddenly your watching a ""Planet of the Apes"" Film.Most notable are the visuals and the theory of the hollow earth.The most irritating it seems we've seem this kind of story thousands of times.Still cannot understand why destroy too much monumental and ancient structures, it will be not too much to destroy for the future, in case they decide to continue the series...And the most funny, as written before, it gets the apparently you are screening at the beginning 2 different kind of films King Kong and Goddzilla by its side and suddenly you jump to Planet of the Apes finishing seeing a Curious George Film ;D.",6
Get ready for a wild ride,"Forget a well-crafted story, Adam Wingard's ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" feels more like a hyperactive kid's imagination on overdrive. Imagine an eight-year-old hopped up on candy, smashing action figures together and roaring with glee. That's the energy of this movie.While Wingard's previous Godzilla film embraced the campy fun of the old-school monster movies, ""New Empire"" goes all-out, delivering a wild, cartoonish adventure that's like a visual toybox. It might not be the smartest film, but it's guaranteed to be a blast.The movie's big showdown features a chaotic zero-gravity battle between multiple monsters, some with energy blasts and one with an unexpected weapon. While such a spectacle might have been unbelievable in the past, it's clear the studio went all out here with a whopping $135 million budget. This is in stark contrast to Toho's ""Godzilla Minus One"" which had a much smaller price tag of $12 million.Big budget movies lately have been all about special effects and established franchises, demanding the audience pay close attention and participate in online discussions. ""Godzilla x Kong"" flips the script. Who cares about complicated backstories or building the world? This movie just wants you to have pure, dumb fun watching Kong beat the snot out of other giant apes with a tiny ape club.The MonsterVerse movies from Warner Bros. Haven't quite hit the mark. Since 2014, they've tried (and failed) to be serious and adult. ""Godzilla"" (by Gareth Edwards) focused on dark human drama instead of epic monster battles - a mistake. ""Kong: Skull Island"" by Jordan Vogt-Roberts tried to be like ""Apocalypse Now,"" but missed the mark. ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" (by Michael Dougherty) aimed for fun, but ended up dull and hard to see with all the smoke. Who needs realistic physics in a movie with Godzilla, King Ghidorah, Mothra, and Rodan? Give us the monster mayhem!Our giant ape hero is looking worse for wear. He's sporting a ""dad bod"" and a gray beard, constantly harassed by creepy monsters, and worst of all, suffering from a nasty toothache. Thankfully, Dr. Ilene Andrews and her daughter Jia are there to help. They even brought in a charming monster vet named Trapper to address Kong's dental woes. These two human characters are a highlight of the film, managing to deliver even the most ridiculous lines with complete seriousness.",6
Greatest insult against our memory.,"This movie is an abomination, an insult to all of us who grew up watching monster movies. Hollywood took the most archetypal monsters and not only changed their essence; It changed its role, its motivation, its form, its universe. This insult against our history must not go unpunished. First: they turned King Kong (historically a giant gorilla attached to blondes) into a friend of children and defender of humanity. They made with him what Gamera was at the time. Then they took Godzilla: he went from being the king of the monsters to simply becoming King Kong's partner to defeat potential enemies. The insult didn't stop there; They transformed Mothra, an enviable enemy of Godzilla into a key defender of humanity. The aberration was adorned with a choral cast where all races are present, making the experience even more vomitous. The plot is indefensible: nothing has logic, nothing has coherence, the past is not honored (nor Godzilla's music) nor the mystique of the great monsters that marked our lives. Those who made the film should go to jail for this attack. On the positive side is a well-done fight sequence. That adds a point to this humiliating, painful and daringly fatal experience.",2
Best of the recent movies!,"I love all things Godzilla, but after watching the trailers for this one I was not so sure. Mini Kong was a big red flag for me. However that part of the story was well done.A big positive was the somewhat limited parts the humans played. Yes, there were some cringe moments, like how a dentist knows how to pilot a high tech craft. The acting was pretty good, and the attempts at comedy were tolerable.Disappointed that the story was 70% Kong and less Godzilla, although the Kong story was pretty good. But, could they not come up with a better name for the villain, Scar King? Really?I was hoping Godzilla's enemy would be Destroyah, that would have been epic.The end battle was okay, but not great.Several people in the theater were clapping, so I am not alone in liking this one.I will definitely buy the blu-ray!",8
Mostly stupid but still entertaining,"First a little mini rant. I've noticed a trend that action/superhero/effects movies tend to have a 3D release. With a few notable exceptions, there seems to be no reason for it. There are a lot of really cool potential effects that the filmmakers could use to make 3D worthwhile, but they usually end up not using the. So PLEASE STOP!!OK, so on to the review. This movie is a mess. Put more truthfully, it's really TWO movies. There's the monster movie of Kong fighting a tribe of ancient enslaved apes with an equally enslaved ice monster (the Godzilla/anti-Godzilla concept was actually kind of cool), Godzilla fighting the Titans and wrecking havoc on world cities, and Mothra bringing order and balance to the whole. Then there's the human movie of discovering a lost (and quite advanced civilization) that unites Jia with the people she thought she had lost (oh, and she's a Messiah/savior figure to boot - who would have guessed)?The Monster Movie is fun, as you would expected (and again, here's where the 3D effects would have done in really handy and been really cool - lost opportunity, guys). It's really stupid and nonsensical, but run to watch Rome, and Cairo and the Pyramids, and Rio get tromped on by Godzilla and the other beasts. In this case there's little to no dialogue or acting needed, so it's pure action.The secondary discovery of the lost civilization movie had real potential. Since it was nestled inside the monster movie, there was not really enough time to develop this, so it felt rushed and perfunctory. This could have been a sort of Underground Pandora, with (again lost opportunity) cool 3D graphics. But because this is really a monster movie, the action jumped back and forth between the two, sometimes with scenes of humans trying to track Godzilla (why?). It makes the movie kind of a disjointed mess.The writing and acting are stupendously bad - terrific waste of some really good talent.I would have loved for this to have actually been two different movies. The origin story of the telepathic Iwi, how they ended up in the uncharted second level underground layer of Hollow Earth, and the story behind their (apparently) special relationship with Mothra would have been really and could have made up a full movie (or even franchise) in and of itself.Ultimately, it's got the same appeal of a Mission:Impossible or Fast and Furious movie. Sometimes you just want to go see things get blowed up.",6
Flop plot,"How can i say... This movie have everything i call generic. American movies are more focused on bringing more cgi effects and transformers stuff than a good story. Surreal stuff happens and they react like ""yeah thats normal, pretty basics"" and that kind of stuff you know?! In the middle of the movie i almost praied to end that. I gave it a 5 not to give 4. Theres nothing i can say it is very good. Everythings generic, and now they bring the sound effects of transformers now think... Dont waste your time and money and wait to see on internet. Even so you need to think on that. Minus One is BY FAR better than this.",5
Fantastic movie,Fantastic fun movie made me laugh and even made me feel more for kong though Godzilla is still my favourite.The side characters were really enjoyable but did not overwhelm the movie. Kong had a good arc which made me enjoy him more as a character the characters that turn up later in the movie also had their turn around moments and I hope Shimo gets more screen time in the next movie she's a really cool monster with a great design and hope they explore her character more in the future this movie was a joy to watch and is not depressing or polarising like a lot of movies these days they need to make more fun movies like this one.,10
Absolutely Stupid,"I left the theater feeling stupid, but yeah, I expected that. What I didn't expect was that Kong could get a toothache, and Godzilla now can run! And jump! And what material is Kong's robot arm made of? It didn't get a single dent after the fight with other titans. And don't get me started on Godzilla getting an upgrade and becoming pink after killing another titan who never even antagonized him. I guess the villain is not too bad, but the humans are utterly useless. While it's not as bad as Monarch the TV series (which is a snoozefest), it's still not good. The only decent monsterverse movies in my opinion are the first Godzilla and Kong Skull Island. The others in the franchise are just dumb. They're not unwatchable or anything, but just don't expect too much. I gave it a 6 because I didnt feel like I wanted to leave the theater early.",6
Easily the Worst Script ever made.,"The script is truly rubbish. The scriptwriter, director and the studio really treat their audience as if they have no brains and it is a real lack of respect. Sure they are monsters fighting, but still the simple fact of how what is happening is described is seriously the worst thing I have ever seen.I can't believe they actually think the public agrees with what's happening. Humans only appear to explain things to you that don't make any sense. Gozilla sleeping like a cat in the Colosseum is simply lazy writing. Kong with a toothache really made me feel so cringe that I couldn't take anything else seriously. This movie is simply bad.",2
What the hell was that ?,"2 stars for visual effects.The actors are completely out of range, it's cringe, its dated, it's unoriginal, the music looked like it came from another movie, the script is non-existent, it was a pure horrific nightmare to watch.I really wanted to gave this movie a chance, but the movie let me down completely.The script itself was lost in it's story, there was no explanation whatsoever, we have some scenes that were already seen a zigabillion times.Oh, and it's a happy ending for our heroes (of course) but let's not talk about the fact that millions of people were killed when titans, Kong and Godzilla are fighting in the middle of some cities...Waste your time with this movie if you want to truly comprehend how we can still make movies already seen with no heart in it.",2
Brilliant movie in the monsterverse,"Love to see pink little bit disappointed for the little fight scenes expect to be more fight scenes, amazing hollow earth views. Hollow Earth is a mystery. Love to see more godzilla scenesand fight is rather a cameo more should be there. But still superbly entertained and kong oh so powerful.Hope next movies will be good or expecting even better than this one. We would love to see a solo godzilla movie in which he will be seen more and there should be more fight scenes and more powerful titans. Lastly hats off to the producers again for the amazing portrait of the hollow earth,hope we can see more of it in upcoming monsterverse movies.",10
Kong of War,"What in the Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers Infinity War, God of War, Planet of the Apes, Avatar mishmash did I just watch?Stupid, over the top, and ridiculous is Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. The only question I have is what ideas didn't they cut from what I imagine is a pool of stupidity.But this is exactly what I expected. Fun stupidity, and while it was fun, it just wasn't as much fun as I would've hoped.The film opens up to some great titan action, and then things just stop in the second act. Focusing way too much on the boring human subplot. Godzilla is unfortunately wasted and not properly utilized. I appreciate them showing how he's charging up his power, but then he only has it for like five minutes when he spent literally the whole movie charging it up.Fortunately, things do pick up in the third act with some great action. However, it was underwhelming and just ended too fast. If they spent more time on titan action and less on the boring human subplot, then they would have had time and wouldn't have needed to rush the third act.The film was beautiful, thankfully, and surprisingly, the 3D looked really good. I normally don't care for 3D, but for some reason, all the showings today at my local cinema were in 3D only.Overall, while this is better than King of the Monsters, I don't think it's better than Godzilla Vs. Kong. Irregardless, all three of these films are painfully average to below average anyway.So if you can turn your brain off to all the stupidity and stomach some boring human drama, then I'm sure Godzilla x Kong will provide some popcorn eating entertainment this holiday weekend.IMDb: 4/10

5 movies to get it right in glorious IMAX 3D,"What I you want from a Warner Brothers Godzilla / Kong movie? Giant CGI monster fights. Don't get me wrong, Godzilla -1 was great. But that's a different monster, literally. Samuel Jackson, Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Millie Bobbie Brown, Rebecca Hall, all great actors, love their other work. I don't care about their collective back story / family drama when it gets in the way of giant CGI Kong / Godzilla / Monster fights. This is the Warner Bothers version finally done right. From literally the opening shot it's a giant Kong monster fight followed by another giant CGI monster fight followed by another, and then another, every 5 maybe 10 minutes tops. Spaced thankfully very sparingly with just enough human narrative / exposition to keep the movie humming along with just enough plot and then, yes, get to the next giant CGI monster fight. Which all Dah-liver in glorious IMAX 3D. Don't waste your time seeing this in anything other than IMAX 3D. It's not going to win any awards other than Special Effects (Godzilla -1) and it should win that in a walk away. The effects are spectacular in IMAX 3D and they had the audience I saw this with standing up and cheering.",8
"High expectations, wish u never paid for the movie.","The movie was awful. If you liked the 2014 version and especially king of the monsters, this is a cocomelon version of any of those. Shimu is a huge disappointment, scar king has attitude, monsters don't need human emotion!!! Stop destroying good characters by making them more human!!....you'd think these directors would learn. Do yourself a favor and don't pay for it. Wait for it to come out. You'll be glad you did. Just wasted $40 on tickets and another 30 on snacks for a horrible movie. Even my teenager thought it was stupid. And I'm an optimist!! Lol. Wait for it to come out for $25 and have 24 of your friends come over for a dollar and maybe the one that likes soap operas will enjoy it.",1
"Oh my god, what was that","I felt like this movie had no sense. Dialogues vere missing, there was no engaging story, like 80% of the movie is sounds of screaming monkey and screaming godzilla. Previous one from 2021 was much better. I watched them in cinema on the marathon and one after another, oh my... there was huge difference, 2021 movie had more sense in sake of story, shooting. In this movie the plot is chaotic and is not very engaging. If someone wants to go to the theatre's just to watch fight scenes, I guess he will be satisfied but personally - I wasnt. Important thing is that I am not a huge fun of this franchise but valid point is that the previous version satisfied me much more.",4
All an all what you expect from a monster movie id delivers,I just finished the movie. Though it has a fast pace from the previous movies but you will be amazed by many shots and new monsters. Godzilla being bad ass daddy and kong being the family guy to watch then is very cool. You will know about some great back story of titans and you will now able to connect dots and also there are many cute awww moments also. One thing you may not like is how fastly things will happen here and there and you kinda wanted to see some more actions in fight scene but it is ok. You will be able to see how humans and titans are connected and some important role of humans in this battle.,8
It's All So Terrible...,"The tropes, the cliched characters, the story, another ""girl boss"". How did this get made? The script is awful, the acting is as bad as the story and it's boring. So very boring. You've seen this very same plot, characters and situations multiple times. I saw this after Godzilla Minus One, which was excellent and true to the subject matter, while this is anything but. It seems to have been written by school children for school children, and they still would have been disappointed. Hollywood will keep making this type of horrible nonsense while people pay to watch it. I can't see anyone older that early teens enjoying this. I sure didn't.",3
Best Kaiju movie ever!!!,"Godzilla x Kong a new empire is my new favourite monster flick! DONT LISTEN TO THE ""CRITICS"" WHO GIVE IT BAD OR MEDIOCRE REVIEWS. It takes everything great from king of the monsters and Godzilla vs Kong and adds so much more! Its quirky and entertaining like Skull island. I watched it in cinema in 4DX. It was the perfect movie for this with many explosions and great fight scenes that drag on but keep you stimulated with vibrant, astonishing and groundbreaking VFX such as Godzilla's supercharged radioactive beam. It incorporates a lot of confusing but exciting science that sometimes bored me and great vibes of mystery. The science fiction and wonder is great. The bizarre but chaotic plot had me gripped and enthralled with emotion and amazement - but some brainless moments too. I think the film is basically just a Kong film with a bit of godzilla spice. Its like avatar plus planet of the apes. I must say Godzilla's final form was a bit underwhelming (I think minus one and shin Godzilla did better) but it was still astonishing and I liked it. Overall I loved it and there is much more to say!",9
The start of mediocrity,"I am not a fan keep criticizing every small imperfection of movies from sci-fi or fantasy worlds. I liked the last godzilla vs king movie, and I liked the Monarch show on Apple TV. That said, this latest movie is definitely not a movie I would watch again, not even if I am bored on a trans-continent flight.The plot is strange. I'm feeling the basic idea is to let kong and godzilla to be friends. And give Kong a kingdom so he could be the ""King"" Kong. I can also accept the idea of ""underground world"" of the ""hollow earth"", if you take the ""hollow earth"" as another world rather than the literal ""inside earth crust"". But how the heck did Godzilla ""seal"" the scar king in there? And how the hell did the entire ape world become a slavery tribe? And they had to introduce another Godzilla-type of monsters in there to ""even the play field""? And the setup that governments have no pieces in the ""hollow earth"" is just laughable. Ok, i'll bite. But aren't there many visible portals around? Why did the scar king stay put until one of his henchmen saw the temporarily revealed portal from the ""not so hidden tribe""? And, I think Jia was cute in the last movie, but her presence and the entire underground civilization setting is just W. T. F.Still remotely entertaining, seeing monsters fight and all. But this is definitely a very much downgrade from the last few movies.",5
"Little tension, big beatdowns","I went into this movie just wanting to see ""big monsters hit each other."" There's definitely a lot of fight instances, however I found myself disappointed by a lot of them. Most of them were one sided beat downs some of which lasted seconds. I thought maybe it's okay because we are building up for one big epic finale fight, but that also felt very one sided and as a result a little boring.Important to say the movie definitely had its moments. There were some good laughs and enjoyable moments between Godzilla and Kong. There was enough to make me smile that made me not rate this lower. Unfortunately the negatives outweighed the positives for me.The inclusion of Godzilla in this movie did not quite feel right. He was kind of just there and almost just a plot convence and to pull people into the seats by having him in the title. The main focus is on Kong which is not a problem, but you would expect to see a little more than a few very quick scenes of here's where Godzilla is now.The people scenes are the weakest parts of the film. Not that interesting, the comedic relief is not that great and some decisions seem nonsensical.Lastly I am a firm believer of the suspension of disbelief and just accepting the rules of a movies world. I am super annoyed but this blue stick that magically controls the other ""big bad"" with absolutely no explanation other than ""he uses pain to control it.""Overall if you are looking for big monster beatdowns where there's little tension and no fear for the heroes then check this out.",5
Monster epic film with lots of action and style that delivers big screen entertainment.,5 out of 5 stars.Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire is an awesome monster film that delivers a great sequel to the monsterverse. Having Kong and Godzilla team up to battle against Skar King a giant ape who is bent on escaping the Hollow Earth to take over. While Kong will need all the help he can get.Plot is great. The action sequences are exciting and a wild ride. The visual effects are great. Adam Wingard direction of giving it a special colorful lighting does a great job. And the music score is also very promising. The cast ensemble is great too. The human characters are more on the side lines while the monsters take majority of the screen time with a destructive battle. The villain was great. There is also a surprise with the team up as kong and godzilla fight against the bad guy and another titan appearance is fun too.This film is just awesome in every level that is worth seeing on the biggest screen.,10
disappointed,"I don't know, is it difficult to produce a great film these days? I don't see anything interesting watching this movie! The story is very boring and the events are not very interesting.The actors are not professionals, it's a copy of the previous movie If you have watched the previous version of this film, you will see the same places and the same effects.Don't waste your time watching itis clearly not that interestedI don't know if the producers of this film care about viewers' opinions and ratings or if they only care about the money But I know that in the previous version there were very bad review's to the film and they did not pay any attention to it. They produced a film worse than the previous version.Please stop making parts for this movie, it has become very boring.",2
an absolute BLAST!!!,"Now i know this movie is not gonna win everybody over but it hella did for me!! This is the most entertaining monsterverse film so far, not 10 minutes go by without a monster fight and that is really what everybody is wanting from the king of the monsters and the 8th wonder of the world right? Ofcourse the movie has many flaws as usual the humans are the worst part of the movie but they are a improvement over milly boby brown from the last two. And really the main character of the movie is KONG himself! Tho being a godzilla fan it did hurt to see godzilla be kinda shoved in last second, but he is still in it a good chunk of the time. And i know that godzilla minus one just came out and i know it was really good but thinking that is good and THIS isnt just is not right! They are two completly different movies and have no right to be compared to eachother and godzilla is such a flexable character he can work in a gritty world and a campy fun world! And i am so glad that we live it times were we can have both kinds!!",10
It's okay I guess,"Went without a lot of expectations but was still a bit dissatisfied by the end. The visuals were fine but the story seemed to be a randomly collected mess of tropes. (Mind you I have never seen any other Godzilla or Kong movies) The sort of mystical people who were unknown to anyone just honestly didn't add anything to the story here. They weren't fleshed out and fell flat.Got to see some cool titans tho, thats always cool. All the running and screaming humans added nothing for me tho. Somehow I would be curious what the story could be if we removed it from the human world completely. I kinda want to see Kong just explore the hollow earth and discover things on his own without the chosen one child there.",5
"In the land of the blind, the one eyed man still hated it.","Seriously b grade animation akin to video game graphics, a patchy storyline and oddly enough, better acting from the CGI characters than the real ones.Like someone who jumps off a bridge into water, hoping for a rush, I too was disappointed to find out it was way too shallow to dive into.Even the 'camera work' was poorly framed and the storyline was vapid at best. I think everyone can agree when they created baby Yoda they birthed a cute and likeable character that people wanted to see more of, but even the 'jump the shark' effort of introducing baby Kong falls shorter than the life that was left in Happy Days.",2
Amazing movie!,"**Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire** is what I went to see at the movies. I had a lot of fun with this movie. I found it to be an extremely entertaining monster movie where you don't have to think too much. Just like that. Just let the flow of images wash over you and entertain you. As I said, I had so much fun with the movie. Why did it work so well? It is a tribute to legendary monsters and great apes. CGI was used a lot, but it was well done. Now, that's what I call style! For once, monsters roared properly on the screen. This was like it was made just for me. Like a video game come to life in front of your eyes on a big screen. Fantastic! The movie made me smile and laugh. That's what happened this time. The movie did its job. One A big surprise for me. The story was thin, it must be said. But it basically didn't matter at all. One of the best movies of the year.",10
"Like Mothra to a flame, I was unfortunately drawn to this film.","An unengaging and boring film. There are a few sequences with King Kong that feel as if they could be from a far superior film, tragically, they are not. Godzilla has perhaps five minutes of screen time, he is shoehorned into a king Kong movie. The cgi on Godzilla is inconsistent and never as good as Minus One, which is embarrassing considering the budget. Also some of the other monsters have very poor cgi as well.Now, what about the humans you ask? Well, they take up a fair chunk of the film despite being incredibly uninteresting and boring, and annoying at times as well. The writing is mediocre and primarily comprised of exposition.I feel like this movie played it safe, It never truly went into over the top dumb fun mode-instead it just straddled the line.Not worth the price of admission.",3
HEEEEEECCCCCKKKKKKKK YYYYEEEAAAAAHHHH!!!,"This movie is awesome! I happen to be a Godzilla fan. So I'm not coming into this not knowing anything. I really loved this movie. My family and I were all excited for the last year and then the first trailer hit. My wife, myself, and my kids were so pumped. The CGI is amazing. Yes sometimes the sizes can sometimes change but they talked about this in Kong Vs Godzilla. They made choices so it fit better with the movie. Which is so fine. I am not about to judge it for that.Anywhoooooo. The movie is so fun. It could be really bad but with the CGI and the story it keeps you watching. We all had so much fun. I love how Godzilla turns pink and just the fights. They knew what we wanted and gave us what we wanted as fans! And it loooks frrriiiiigin amazing!! I love this movie exceeded gross expectations.This movie is so fun. Yes it's no Oscar movie but hell yeah it's a popcorn movie. My kids and I were yelling kick his....butt lol. It was great.",10
Visual Noise and Useless Characters,"The 2014 Godzilla was enjoyable but not great. The most common criticism was the habit of cutting away from the monster action as soon as it became interesting, but that wasn't the issue. The real issue, which has been expanded on with every theatrical follow-up film, is the fact when they cut away it's to underdeveloped characters that either have no personality or an exaggerated, trope-filled personality, aka ""Look at me! I'm an interesting character because I'm flamboyant and loud and kooky!"".Godzilla x King: The Stupidest Title Yet takes that to a new level. The human characters are cartoons with no resemblance to real people that I might care about. Unfortunately I also don't believe any of the monsters are real because the CG and animation are also cartoonish and therefore not good enough to sell the suspension, unlike the 1/10th budget Godzilla Minus One and unique Shin Godzilla. Those films also illustrate another problem with the Hollywood versions: the monsters are way too big. They clearly subscribed to the ""Bigger is better"" mindset, but it makes them even more difficult to take seriously as living organisms since our brains default to basic grade school science that tells us such things couldn't exist due to their own mass. The monsters in the others are already on the cusp of that suspension, so going bigger is definitely not better.The only interesting and engaging characters in the Legendary Monsterverse are in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.",5
$135 million trash,"I always switch on the sequences in video games when I want to play them myself. At least that was the case with my last game about 15 years ago. But if you like watching that, you've come to the right place. There's also product placement, blockbuster nonsense, Michael Bay aesthetics, further exploitation and perversion of the basic story. The only central content seems to be the question of which metropolis is being destroyed by a keyboard. I can't find any reference to its predecessor, which is typical of this type of film: turn off your brain, take in a flood of images, maybe be reasonably entertained for the duration, lose a dozen brain cells, remember nothing a day later. Although, a memory can also have a negative impact. The whole hollow earth nonsense was already bananas, but the body modification in Kong tops it all again. Somehow you like this Kong throughout the film, at least he doesn't mess that up, but it's still $135 million trash.",5
Elevated The Universe; One of The Best MonsterVerse Movies,"One of the best movies of the MonsterVerse. The body language portrayed by the monsters really add another layer to the film. Each main kaiju is spewing with personality, specifically with Skar King being cocky & Kong having empathy. Even the humans were good.This sequel is proof that with great VFX and body language, the CGI monsters themselves can tell a story with NO humans.Skar Kong is easily the best villain in the MonsterVerse imo. His arrogance and cocky personality is fun to watch on the screen, especially with how he mocks King Kong. His movement when fighting is very fun to watch. He doesn't respect his opponents.",8
Turn off your brain and you might enjoy...or not,"Can't say that I even remember any of last titans film plot, not that it matters to anything. This is a movie that you can go and watch without knowing a single thing about a single plot detail. Sometimes it could be good, but as far as it goes with this mash up of Godzilla and Kong, it is not a good fact.It is the classic film for the viewers to click on the button of ignoring large details of it and not pay attention to the amount of inventions that holds no grasp in the real world. Just come to see a bunch of monsters fighting each other and let your brain take a leave to a vacation of almost two hours.The plot is not even a thing here. We are talking about a giant ape with a giant monster. An underworld, that is so beautiful and haven't been concurred by the human race (yet) and a lot of collateral damage that even several wars can cause to, that is being ignored for the sake of the film's plot.The human characters are plastic and are for the sake of exposition, storytelling and narrative building. Nothing that they do is not contributing to our understanding or enjoyment from this film. It seems that this movie producers are not interested of harnessing their audience to anything but blows and crashes.Regarding the ""epic"" and exhausting battles - I found myself sleeping and re-watching them several times; A fact that cannot serve well the movie, from my side. They looked unreal and were so repetitive, that it was starting to be boring, much more than exciting. It is nice service for monster films, but not a good movie to each and every actual movie fans.",5

An overly dumb attempt of an 80s throwback,"With monsters that exist only to fight each other and characters that exist only to explain why the fights are happening, 'Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire' feels like an elaborately expensive WWE event.The soundtrack feels like it came right out of a40 year old's playlist, with barely any of the songs having any meaning to what we're seeing other than to turn up the fun factor that little bit more. The story can best be summarised as 'big ape and big lizard vs evil big ape and misunderstood big lizard', with every scene and sequence featuring humans that lead up to the fights consistently crank up the ludicrous levels of over-explanation as to how any of it makes sense. The monsters, after all this time, are put front and centre with Kong leading the charge. The effects look on par with the previous Monsterverse entries, but the fights are far and beyond superior with understanding of gravity and physics traded in for hilariously, stupidly entertaining punching matches.On the other hand, a lot of the actors kinda look like they're clueless about what they're doing, but are decent at selling the absurdity. Although I liked Dan Stevens the most, but I didn't really find any of the characters that interesting. The jokes are the same inoffensive streamlined humour that plagues modern movies and therefore the only laughs you'll get are from the monster fights or stupid science jargon that doesn't make sense. The 'New Empire' itself too is more like an ancient empire, so I gotta ask, what's wrong with the title 'Godzilla X Kong: The Old Empire'? And for a movie that headlines Kong and Godzilla, there really isn't that much Godzilla and that monster kinda feels more like a side character than a co-lead.This is a movie that isn't really supposed to make sense and is by almost every sense of the term, a 'popcorn flick', an easily digestible blockbuster movie. It works purely as switch-your-brain-off entertainment and nothing else.",5
So Silly,"For as long as box office sales skyrocket, production companies will keep making movies off the same concept over and over again. It's time to let Godzilla and Kong rest...they're as tired as the movie plots. It's a very weak script, not so great acting from rather decent actors. We're talking veterinarians who fly in on helicopters playing what's supposed to be cool music to repair Kongs rotted tooth? Come on!!! The storyline jumps all over the place with very little screen time for Godzilla. This was really painful...even the climatic music made it hard to care. If you feel compelled to watch it, wait until it's out on Netflix.",4
Wow great adventure and fun monster fights!,"Godzilla x Kong really learned from the past movies and made a smash hit with this one!I spent some time the past week catching up with Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Godzilla vs Kong. Those were decent in their own respects, but the first suffered from too much dialogue and human reaction shots while the second had a sort of haphazard story strung through to make the matchup happen.In this latest installment of the Monster Verse, we get just enough story to push our humans and monsters along into an increasingly grand and interesting adventure that keeps on delighting at every turn! We get to see new discoveries about monster background and legends naturally without it being spoonfed. And we get So Much Action! There are a variety of monster fights left and right and each battle makes sense in their own context. They're really fun to behold and they do a great job mixing things up to keep you guessing as to what will happen next.I went in not expecting much based on the past ones, and even a bit hesitant thinking it was mostly going to be about Kong and relatives based on the trailer. But it generously exceeded my expectations and I'm glad to have gone on the ride! I feel like Transformers could learn a lot from this team on how to make giant things fight in a really fun and interesting way.I would say, don't think too much about where we're going or how we got here. Go with the monster flow and you'll have a great time with this one!",8
And I thought the one before was bad!,"I think I have my own movie rating system. The best movies are those worth seeing at the cinema and paying full price and overly expensive snacks. The next below is a matinee at the cinema, followed by wait until it's on a pay channel and eventually regular TV.This is where this movie belongs. It could quite possibly be the most idiotic movie I've ever seen. The giant ice turtle hiding behind the lava waterfall? The signing child with the mute tribe? It's a CGI mess.But the most ridiculous thing of all is the hollow earth TV. The best part of it is the worst part of it. The CGI is very good; but much like most movies today, there's too much.Kudos for sneaking a little KISS and Badfinger in it. That's how it got the second star.",2
Can't wait for more to come,This movie was just epic my only cons about this movie is of course the human characters but the final battle felt really short and I feel like skar king and shimu could've done way more then they did in this movie but just the utter action and kaiju fights in this movie just completely overthrow my cons one of the best parts about this movie was just how much action there was don't get me wrong I felt like the final battle could've had way more action but with the amount of kaiju fights we got it's understandable y it was so short considering the movie was only a hour and 55 minutes overall Godzilla x kong the new empire was a fun action packed monster movie and I really hope they do more with the monster verse down the line.,8
Waste of budget,"I can't believe godzilla vs. Kong has lower rating than this. Godzilla vs Kong was well written, acted, tense and interestingly developed from the beginning till the end. I didn't even know there was going to be another sequel because the last one had the great conclusions and ending. Series were just fine, as some side piece about the whole background.All in all, this film was just soooo disappointing. If the targeted audience are children below the age of 12, and eventually some people who love cheap thrills, idk who is supposed to like this cheap scenario and terrible acting. Rebecca Hall was a disappointment in this role. A great actress fell this low.Everyone was acting terribly, and that veterinary dude was particularly annoying i had the urge to punch him in the face the whole time. As i said in the headline, a waste of money this is. Please no more sequels leave the godzilla alone let him sleep peacefully in the colloseum. This has become a disgrace to the beautiful titan characters.",2
Monster Mush,"Following the quite good Godzilla Vs Kong Godzilla x Kong continues the monsterverse storyline with an overcooked boullion of monster nonsense:
Plot: Awful. The writers just seemed to pull stuff out of a hat.Script: see above.CGI and visual effects are overall terrible and not up to todays standards at all. King Kongs expressions and movements and even godzillas are too human. They're movements are too fast and there's not really any sense of scale. Even when they are shown against the human cities they just don't look anywhere like the behemoths they are supposed to be. When the fights are happening the hits dont feel like they connect. The background and world building looks shallow and especially the subterranean world just looks confusing.Nice obvious product placement of a volkswagen car. Probably others but I had gone beyond caring too much.Acting: well there is some. But the writing is so bad I couldn't criticise the poor people who had mistakenly decided to be in this movie.My kids (more target audience than me) liked it but weren't massively impressed.",3
Craziness of Kong 🦍,"10/10Die Hard Fan of monsterverce. I give 10 out of 10. The cinematography is outstanding. The goosebumps grow up when Skar King Came out. I see this movie in theatre (3D/Hindi).If you don't see Godzilla vs Kong so you not feel the craziness. 1stly I say you go and watch Godzilla 2014 and kong: Skull Island then Godzilla vs Kong then you see the Godzilla x kong: the new emperor. Fully Action and fighting scene but if you are a Godzilla fan so a sad thing Godzilla come here at the last. But king kong is the lead monster. Mainly 3 monsters are new the Skar king, Simo & the little kong.Director Adam thanks to give us a great Vibes after 3 years and also Warner Bros and Toho.coI wished you guys love this monsterverce new emperor.",10
Great Teen/YA Movie,"Was expecting something completely different, more along the lines of Godzilla Minus One, but this movie was the chirpy bubblegum-and-unicorns version aimed at telling young adults (confused teens): why, yes you sure can, if you only dream hard enough! Mildly offended by the obligatory ASL deaf child (who could, at least, and not like ""Mom"", actually sign). I have to write another 240 characters about how this movie nearly gave me diabetes just from watching it but I am finally running out of necessary words I need to post this review to the site because you can't obviously say anything worthwhile with less. If you don't like the review, then don't put the idiot 800-word requirement in. That or get a project manager with a working brain.",4
This movie was so good I saw it twice! 10/10,Godzilla X Kong the new empire was an amazing movie with so much action. The whole plot with Scar King and Shimo was amazing my favorite scene was when the got to rio and the music slowed down and shimo jumps out of the ice. At first I didn't like godzillas design but it was amazing though the finally fight was a bit fast there where a ton of fights to make up for it. Even thought Kong was the main focus you could definitely feel that Godzilla had a huge presence when he was on camera. And i loved his spiral ray probably my favorite beam out of all of the godzillas. Scar king was a menace but he was weak and besides the Godzilla vs Kong fight in eygit it didn't feel like there was much plot armor. Over all 11/10.,10
Cliche and soooooo dumb,"This movie has every stupid cliche ever with the only difference being it's got giant monkeys instead of people. The human characters are AWFUL. There's an Australian guy trying to be Starlord (who I really wanted to see get smashed by a truck or something), PaperBoy trying to be nerdy and funny and failing miserably, the woman who is only there to explain all the dumb stuff going on through exposition, and the little mute girl has the emotionless facial expressions of a sanded cantaloupe. The plot is basically good Kong and fire breathing Godzilla vs Bad Kong and ice breathing Godzilla. The soundtrack is annoying and thinks it's being hip and cool. Oh and the evil monkey can control the evil Godzilla using magic crystals.",2
never again,"Terrible garbage i mean, my son is 13 and loves these films like he has toys and many more, he was disappointed at this. The film starts as the most confusing irrelevant garbage ever, and a huge time skip. The silly tribe gia girl is always sad and annoying. Pracically 6 mins of godzilla screen time and some useless kong things of pulling faces and some tribe, it completely destroys KOTM and skull island (i'm interested kind of in this lore) as the useless kid we just knew is apparently some prophet and the movie disregards MBB character.way to fast paced and the hype for the villian that was useless and has 0 impact on the story pulls up on some dragon which is huge and a walmart godzilla. Ruins it could of used the movies previous plot exploring skull island being destroyed by ghidorah or even ghidorahs skull gets its own body. The film is terrible and the fight is mid hense the stars, the fast paced ""action"" which is throwing rocks and annoying human characters would i buy it on sky..no!",3
"Action packed,but more was needed","Don't care about human stories in these movies
I couldn't care less who lives or dies
All i care is more action, more monster fight, i really want a good fight between kong and that other kong again, they should have made that other kong more powerful, like an equal fight between him and our kong
All and all, waiting for the next movie ang all i want is more fight
Godzilla king of the monsters was phenomenal, so many monsters so many fights
Loved it
Loved this one too
These are the only movies worth every penny when watching in theater, the next monster is powerful let's see how godzilla going to handle it.",8
What the heck?,"I don't even know where to begin. Expectations were low, and this movie went below them. I wanted the monster fight scenes to even out the horrible plot I was expecting, but everything was just bad. There was no suspense, no build up, no much of leading to anything. The fight scenes just come and go, there is absolutely no satisfaction from any of them, except the very first one when the credits are playing. Random plot elements are just added randomly throughout the movie, it's like off road driving but not exciting nor thrilling. ????? What a waste of money, this wasn't even a good Kong movie. Easily one of the worst attempts at making a movie that I've seen.",1
Legendary & Spectacular movie,Amazing movie.. fast paced intriguing.. better than its predecessors.. All of the fighting scenes among Titans are too good. Visuals are stunning.. Storyline is not bad.. might call it satisfactory.. and my god the. Antagonist Titan ..the scar king.. so. Villanish.. Movie mostly focused on Kong and throughout the movie Godzilla just evolving. Must watch movie. But if you hadn't seen previous monsterverse movie.. you might get bore or confused. Movie feels like it should have runtime.. it feels short may because it engages you throughout the runtime.. just having the vibe of infinity war. You will enjoying the movie throughout the run only if you had watched all the monsterverse movie.,9
Godzilla Minus One:Godzilla x Kong::Sense and Sensibility:Fifty Shades of Gray,"The title is pretty much my entire review, and I could go on at length, but will do so only because IMDB now requires a certain minimum number of characters for reviews.If you like the effect of sniffing glue and licking a 9 volt battery while headphones at maximum volume are duct taped to your had, by all means, this is the film for you.If you prefer your Godzilla movies -- as I do -- without smirking, ridiculous attempts to manipulate the audience, or mysterious tribes and giant monkeys somehow knowing American Sign Language, pass. If you prefer your Godzilla movies, like I do, with interesting monster fights and not weird clearly CGI screeching motivationless slap fights, pass. If you would like Godzilla not to be wandering around aimlessly for no apparent reason, leaping whole time zones in a matter of seconds, pass.Otherwise it's great!",3
Waste of time and money.,"Doesn't. Make any sense at all. No story k. Just rotating the story from east to north and north to west without connecting the strip. Graphics are good and have some good fight scenes but story is below average. Things happen out of nowhere, without prior explanation or connecting the storyline. Wasted 2 hours of my life on this useless movie.i don't know how this movie could have 6 starts. How they create the portals how they move from Spain to Egypt to Italy or whatever. Only if they have worked in building the story and it would have make any sense but it seems like they were only selling the name not story. I would never watch any of this series film ever again.",2
Comparing it to Godzilla Minus one is the dumbest thing i have ever seen.,"To recap, this movie is made for people who wants to loves Monster's fighting each other rather than drama, full of explicit sex and nudity, a bad ending the symbolize ""Cinema"" (only to lead people with more depression walking out of theater) and Comparing a movie that also appear from the same Franchise( I'm looking at you A. A Dowd). Godzilla has been a fan service since the showa era and this delivers it. Also doing a comparison like calling Minus one is a majestic while Godzilla x Kong a product...bruh those both movie are a love letter to a monster and Minus one also a ""product"". (Also Andrea Chase i think it will be better if there's any other Director who make a movie about a monster hitting on world trade center rather than plane and then calling it as ""Cinematic and tragedy"".) Also if Godzilla 2014 didn't get a positive review than Godzilla Minus one will never be made. That's all see ya.",10
Worst story,"Title: Reimagining the Monster Epic: A Critical ReviewUpon witnessing the latest installment of the legendary monster saga, one can't help but feel a sense of utter disappointment, coupled with a profound feeling of having wasted both time and money. The lack of a coherent storyline leaves viewers grappling for substance as Godzilla finds himself engaged in battles with primates and diminutive reptiles. Comparisons to its predecessor only serve to highlight the stark decline in quality, with the first installment offering a far more compelling narrative. In that film, the protagonists faced off against the formidable foe of Mega Godzilla, a worthy adversary that lent weight to the conflict.Where the first film managed to captivate audiences with its gripping tale, this latest iteration falls short, failing to provide any semblance of a coherent plot. Viewers are left struggling to comprehend the disjointed sequence of events, as the film careens from one lackluster battle scene to another. Even the Godzilla films of the 1990s, often criticized for their campiness, boasted more coherent storylines than this latest endeavor.One of the most glaring deficiencies of this film lies in its lack of compelling fight scenes. Gone are the epic clashes that characterized its predecessor, replaced instead by uninspired skirmishes that fail to elicit any real excitement or emotion from the audience. Where the battles in the first film felt weighty and consequential, those in this sequel come across as mere spectacles devoid of any real substance.Perhaps most damning of all is the fact that even the much-maligned Godzilla film of the 1990s managed to offer a more engaging story than this latest installment. Despite its flaws, that film at least had a narrative arc that kept viewers invested from start to finish. In contrast, this new entry in the franchise feels like little more than a hastily assembled cash grab, devoid of any real passion or creativity.In conclusion, while the allure of witnessing giant monsters battling it out on the big screen may be enough to draw some viewers in, those seeking a truly satisfying cinematic experience are likely to come away disappointed. With its lackluster storyline and uninspired fight scenes, this latest installment of the Godzilla franchise fails to live up to the standards set by its predecessors. Instead of offering a compelling narrative and thrilling action sequences, it serves only to squander the potential of its rich source material. As fans eagerly await the next chapter in the saga, one can only hope that future installments will return to the roots of what made the franchise great in the first place..",1
"Please focus less on humans and more on monsters, thank you","""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire""... I was very hyped for this movie since it involves two of my favorite movie monsters, King Kong and Godzilla tag teaming against some other monsters. You couldn't go wrong with that, could you? Well, albeit the movie not being bad by no means, it also wasn't perfect. But, it definitely was as good, if not a little better than the Godzilla vs Kong movie. Again, I don't get the low ratings, but that is what that is. I will stick to my own feelings and I say, I actually liked this movie. Only downside about it was that it focused a bit too much on the humans which is just getting tiring now from these monster movies. I mean come on, I wanna see monsters fight, not some humans talk and talk and play the stereotypical heroes. That gets boring real quick. The only two great Kaiju movies I can mention that mixed the humans and monsters thing perfectly is Peter Jackson's King Kong and Pacific Rim off the top of my head. Anyways, for me, this was a 5/5 rating, but that might be because i'm a huge fan of Kaiju/monster stuff.",8
God awful movie.,"Horrible. Simple one of the worst movies I have ever finished, after 30 minutes I wanted to leave the theater but stayed anyways for god knows why.. The acting, characters, etc are amongst the worst out of every movie ever made, the character development like with the little deaf psychic girl was just as bad, if not worse! The only reason this review isn't a 1/10 is because of the pretty cool monsters and the last fight scene which was cool to watch as the cgi is pretty good in this movie. The corniness however, drags it down SO GODDAMN MUCH IT HURTS. Please, to anyone reading this, save yourself the money and trouble and do not go watch this movie. Ever.",2
Average not bad Kaiju,"In the colossal showdown between the towering Godzilla and the mighty Kong, the stakes are sky-high, but the pacing feels like a runaway train. While I appreciate fast-paced movies, this one left me breathless. It's as if Kong and Godzilla were sprinting through scenes, barely pausing for a breath. The film balances its focus between humans and titans, but the scales tip unevenly. The human side is well-executed, especially with the endearing Jia, who communicates with Kong using sign language. However, the titans deserved more screen time. I craved deeper exploration of their ancient rivalry and the mysterious Hollow Earth. The plot serves up basic meat and potatoes: monsters duking it out. But here's the twist: it's been done better before, back when men in rubber suits stomped miniature cities. The writers occasionally hit a creative roadblock, tossing in convenient plot devices like Kong's bionic exoskeleton arm or Mothra's unexpected peacemaking gig. The action sequences deliver the expected adrenaline rush, but the CGI wobbles at times. Characters, unfortunately, fall flat - bland and forgettable. And despite the film's title, Godzilla feels like a cameo in his own showdown. Skar King, the villain, lacks the menacing presence we crave. The music? Generic and samey, like a playlist on repeat. But hey, it's popcorn entertainment - adjust your expectations accordingly. ""Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire"" is a middling affair, neither soaring nor sinking. It's a monster mashup that leaves you craving more substance amidst the spectacle.",5
Amazing movie and they must see movie,"I saw this movie yesterday and I wasn't sure what to expect but I must say this movie was outstanding and I loved that the cast from Godzilla vs. Kong (2021) was in it I did not realize that it was a sequel to the movie Godzilla vs. Kong (2021)
There is literally nothing bad. I can say about this movie and it was epic.From beginning to end, the storyline was perfect and the CGI was incredible, Through the whole movie you find yourself rooting for Kong and when Godzilla and Kong come face-to-face it awesome.If you have not seen it you absolutely should I have it 10 stars 🌟 with no hesitation.",10
So bad it's good.,"""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" (2024), where do I even start? So, we've got Kong and Godzilla, apparently the only two LinkedIn connections left who haven't ghosted each other, teaming up again. Because, you know, the real estate on Skull Island just wasn't doing it for them anymore, and apparently, there's a hidden Airbnb for monsters in Hollow Earth they've just discovered.The storyline? Ha! Imagine taking the concept of logic, throwing it into a blender with some monster movie clichés, and hitting the 'puree' button until everything's just a wild, incoherent mess. That's this movie. It's like they thought, ""Hey, how can we top the last level of absurdity?"" And just went for it. By the end, you're half expecting the monsters to pull out lightsabers or start quoting Shakespeare (wait, there's this remote control ice knife which is almost a lightsaber).The script? Oh, it's definitely the work of an AI. I refuse to believe that a room full of actual humans looked at this script and went, ""Yep, that's it. That's cinema."" It's not just illogical; it's a masterclass in throwing logic out of the window and then nuking the site from orbit just to be sure. And the mysticism? It's like they Googled ""how to add depth to a movie without actually adding depth"" and just ran with the first search result.But let's talk about the real stars of the show: the monster fights. Because nothing says ""box office hit"" like turning the most beautiful cities in the world into an all-you-can-wreck buffet for giants. It's visually stunning in the way that only complete and utter destruction can be. You can't help but admire the sheer audacity of it all.And hey, amidst the chaos, the movie passes the Bechdel test. So, in between watching ancient titans play demolition derby with world heritage sites, you can bask in the glow of minimal gender representation. Small victories, right?In conclusion, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is the kind of movie you watch when you want to turn off your brain, question the existence of coherent storytelling, and just see big monsters go smashy-smash on each other and famous landmarks. It's so bad, it's almost good. Almost.",5
Great fun,"Seeing Kong befriend Curious George (the mini gorilla or orangutan) and seeing Godzilla attain super saiyan rose was a great thing. There were a bunch of moments when I thought, ""Man I want a screen saver of that,"" also a whole whole lot of great fight scenes. Mainly my gripes would be with Godzillas under utilization because after he got more power he kept missing his shots over and over again and as you've likely already seen the main characters are weak as always with the exception of trapper being a great addition. Other than that tho if you want a good time passer and great action I'd recommend this one.Also Curious George for the win. \../",8
Missing on all levels,"I don't recommend this little flick to anyone; whether you're a King Kong ""fan"", or Godzilla ""fan"". In fact, if you used to be fans of Godzilla and King Kong, you won't be anymore after watching this movie. What did you expect from a movie with a Gorilla and Dinosaur that can't have dialogue; a lot of missing holes in the plot. The character development is bleek, the pop out scares are unexpected, and the sad story of it all is, the one character that is supposed to have development has a total of 10 minutes screen-time. The main villains aren't even Godzilla and King Kong (even though they fought eachother in the last gig). The main villains are real sad duplicates of Godzilla and King Kong; and don't live up to the hype, and get wiped REAL QUICK.",5
Fun but that's about it,"A fun romp through the 'inner earth' with many a kaiju fight and some very fun and engaging sequences but the film is solely that, fun. Which in it of itself isn't a bad thing but films that are only 'fun' are usually forgotten quite quickly and what is remembered is usually some select sequences of action or peril but the over-arching plot and characters are quickly forgotten amongst the many actions sequences that are far more engaging than the characters and plot. This is the type of film one puts on to turn off your brain and watch a big monkey and lizard fight things and cause damage, nothing wrong with that but it leaves much to be desired in any other regard.",5
Awesome effects,"I love the effects in this movie! Godzilla, Kong, and all the creatures in this movie are all cool and don't look like Marvel cgi abominations which I appreciate. The acting was pretty good by the human actors. I really liked Dan Stevens Ace Ventura-like character, he was chill and I would like to explore uncharted territories with him. Brian Tyree Henry's character was a little bit annoying, but he wasn't the grating comic relief in these sort of films. Henry's character was alright. This movie features ASL which is cool. Godzilla was awesome. Kong was awesome. All the kaiju were awesome. All the creatures were awesome.We'll that's my review, go see this movie, it's great.",9
"Mostly boring, with sparse action and an over-reliance on human characters","I don't necessarily feel compelled to write a review of ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"" as it seems that most reviewers have already echoed my thoughts: the monster battles are cool, the human element is not. However, and much to my displeasure, while watching this film, I even found the action to be underwhelming - and believe me, I never thought I'd say that.""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" seems to be giving viewers what they expect - audience scores are strong, and word of mouth seems to be positive. And I am honestly more than a bit shocked by that considering that, in my opinion, this film features the weakest action scenes of the series by far. Sure, if you enjoy this type of film - and I do - there is enough creature-feature CGI spectacle to quench your kaiju thirst; in fact, there are prolonged sequences of just Kong, or just Godzilla, as they are going about their business, and that was a nice touch when compared to previous films that focused almost solely on the human characters. But, while this film does increase the focus on its titular monsters, it somehow has the least amount of action when compared to the other installments.Listen, I enjoy watching Godzilla and Kong fight to the death as much as the next person; that's all I was really looking for here. So imagine my surprise when the first real action scene takes place around half way through the film; imagine my surprise when the main villain is the least intimidating looking and acting monster known to hollow earth; imagine my surprise when the climactic battle between Godzilla, Kong, and the main villain was underwhelming and way too short, lacking the sense of immense scale that was built up so carefully in the other movies in this franchise. I mean, I don't really know what to say - the action was just missing something. And so, because the action was so sparse and lacking, what was I left with? You guessed it: the human characters.I don't even want to waste time writing about the human element in this film, because you already know that it's as boring as boring can be. I like the actors well enough, but their reliance on cheesy comedy brought the movie down for me, especially since I just didn't find the comedy all that funny. Additionally, and as usual, the film does spend the majority of its running time focusing on the humans, which meant that, for a majority of the running time, I was very, very bored.""Godzilla x Kong"" is fine. It's not a travesty, but it's really not all that good, either. There is some fun action, but in my opinion it was all too little, too late. But who knows! Maybe in the next film they'll learn their lesson...",5
Kong featuring Godzilla,"I'm a lifelong Godzilla fan and I did enjoy the movie. BUT - spoilers: It's a Kong movie featuring Godzilla. I'd let this slide if it didn't show Godzilla constantly powering up throughout only to steamroll Kong who didn't wanna fight (briefly) only to be knocked out by him... and be dragged away - then he wakes up and is interrupted by Mothra. Sure Kong had a mecha type arm... but a regular Godzilla should overpower Kong all day- let a lone a supercharged Godzilla.. how the hell do you let Kong knock him out after ALL THE BUILDUP. Godzilla was basically powering up to fight ""WW3"" and this movie let's Kong KO him (although briefly) - should've never had that in the movie. Kind of ruined it for me.",9
Being better laid out than the last film isn't a huge feat,"Godzilla x Kong is a movie that stands just slightly above Godzilla vs Kong in its inherent quality. Characters have better characterization, plot is slightly more coherent, kaiju moments are roughly the same, etc.The visuals themselves; animation, FX, cinematography, and compositing have gotten much worse. The monsters often range from mediocre 'there's an attempt' to abhorrent animation, cinematography for these kaijus are generally low quality, and overall compositing of the shots are often abysmal, being the worst CGI and cinematography of the MonsterVerse. Any resemblance of what Godzilla 2014 and Kong: Skull Island had is lost in favor of humans in suits.Story itself is decently set out where a lot of visual elements are used in Kong's scenes, which is executed nicely even though a lot of concepts or exposure of concepts remain underutilized or underdeveloped. It allows Kongs story to be understood without the explicit need of humans to lure Kong around, unlike GvK. Godzilla's story is very interjected at random moments, lacking very little presence throughout the entire movie until the third act. The actual worldbuilding, implications in the ape colony and the Hollow Earth is a huge step up.Writing and characterization is generally lower quality, with some okay moments that steps up from GvK. Exposition is done too many times and too much as opposed to showing or implying things with less exposition. Characters are generally better, but a lot of dialogue and writing seems surface-level, where each scene functions as the ""this establishes the trait this person has"", as opposed to spreading out the personality in a realistic way.Pacing is very rushed given the short runtime where the movie would benefit from having more drawn-out moments, allowing pacing to breathe naturally given the content provided. This also plays into editing, which overall is okay, but the editing completely falls apart in the final surface fight, the weakest part of the movie, where it goes by very quickly among bad editing, cinematography, etc.OST is simply bad, paying very little respect or never matching the tone of any scene.I hope for the next movies to be a significantly better film, from a story and writing perspective and from a visual perspective. Human characters need to be better and comprehensible, and writing should feel natural and not forced. The series shift from the more serious tone to a lighter tone is jarring, but the more problematic aspect is the decrease of filmmaking quality all across.",4
Worst of Monsterverse,"The worst movie monsterverse ever made, improper size scaling, successfully wasted three titans in a single movie, a Titan like Tiamat was one shot by Godzilla, Skar King, who was trying to act like a bada*s villain in the trailer, was nothing but a tennis ball for Godzilla and Kong, the first titan Shimo, who was stated to be responsible for the previous Ice Age on Earth, was not able to freeze mere Kong, after watching the trailer, I thought Shimo would be a threat for humanity, but they literally made her kong's pet. The all over movie was silly and childish. And also releasing too much TV spots destroyed the hype for the movie.",3
Felt Rushed But Greatest Monsterverse Flim Yet,"This By Far Has Had The Best/Most Action Yet, It Was So Enjoyable, Had Some Laughs Throughout It, Worth The 3 Year Wait In My Opinion, It Did Feel A Bit Rushed, I Was Hoping It'd Be Longer But Non Of The Less It Was A Perfect Return For Are Favorite Protagonists's, I Also Wished The Film Was More Godzilla Focused, The G-Man's Fights Felt Hella Rushed But In A Good More Reasonable And Awesome Way Making Him Seem Like A True King And An Unstoppable Force For What Would Come Later For Him In The Movie, Hoping Adam Wingard Gives Us More Films Like This, I Might Personally Go Watch It Again But In IMAX. 🔥😁",9
Worst Godzilla/Kong movie ever made,"I seriously thought this one would be awesome one but no.... so many mistakes, cheesy story.... No explanation for what so ever....so many scenes that doesn't make any sense... seriously I'm lost for words...its just sad to know that this movie could have been one of those awesome monster movies that you even buy a dvd version of just in case so you could always watch it, but sadly in this case you se it once and never again.... ORE.... put it in the category "" movies that help you fall a sleep faster""
Imagine all the workers that busted their ass of to make it awesome, but in the end it was just waste of their precious time and energy.... I fell sad for them....",1
Less Humans More Kaiju,"I love Kaiju movies, I grew up with them and they are always fun. Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera, I was there for all of them.This movie is great but I found the humans really annoying. They did not contribute anything not the story and in places actually slowed it down. In the original Japanese movies, the humans usually helped the story forward and added drama. This cast added nothing at all.The action with the monsters was excellent and the special effects were great. I am also adding an extra star for the music as well.This is a fun movie with plenty of action but a really forgettable cast. Is this one of the best Kaiju movies? Not really, the classic movies are better, but this was entertaining and I am happy with that.",8
Worst movie,Please dont waste your time and money watch this nonsense..just monsters fighting each other and making so much noise. I couldnt wait for it to get over.They could have made the storyline interesting .there was no suspense. Just utter stupidity. They had like 4 different monsters .there was no excitement and so boring.it gave me a headache.The worse movie ever.90 of the movie these silly monsters just fighting each other and try to kill other.Just a little bit of humour here and the main heroine was good.i had gone to the cinema after ages and never have I complained about any movie.but this was pathetic.,1
Meh,"I left the theater after watching GxK feeling the same way that I felt after watching KOTM - just not sure.I had hope since Godzilla vs Kong was a good turnaround for the monsterverse... but this was slightly disappointing. The previous films had huge spectacle and amazing CGI.. and this film falls short.From the first few scenes the CGI was questionable and looked almost cartoony.. and the script is a complete dumpster fire.While I do appreciate the cheesy battles.. there were almost too many. When the final battle came and went I found myself pretty underwhelmed... the battles leading up to it seemed bigger.I get that they're trying to draw in a bigger audience and demographic but this movie just fell short for me unfortunately. There are some really pretty shots and good camera work, but the movie as a whole..... you can tell it's the cheapest monster verse film to date.And is it just me or did they reuse a lot of the same music from Godzilla vs Kong?I'll still buy this as soon as it comes out, and it's definitely something that you could see and enjoy if you haven't watched any previous installments.",5
Tops the last one.,"A group of scientists uncover a mystery about Skull Island, and must unravel it before a situation with Godzilla and Kong get out of hand.An enjoyable monster verse film, I mean I like the way it tries to humanize Godzilla and Kong, and the effects are always great. But I admire the way the film doesn't spend too much time on Godzilla and Kong, cause Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyler Henry, and Dan Stevens all have there moments to shine, and they are every bit as enjoyable has the monsters. Dan Stevens steals every scene he's in, won't be surprised if he gets his own spin off movie. The monster fights are also great.",9
!Even worse than the last one!,"Thomas Tull once had his name and credit attached to one of the best popular movies of all time. He said: its ok if we lost its director we have found a replacement on the man who direct 300 That shows how much he knows about films and about movies.The first director went on to make Oscar winning films like Inception and Oppenhaimer, while the second one directs and Army of rebels to losing millions and Tull went for producing crowd-pleasing masterpiece with Nolan to ruining his legacy with trash as this one.Sure its making money, by the cannibalization of Dune 2 biggest screens but its also the worse King Kong movie i ve ever seen.At least its not the worse Godzilla movie ever. At least...
The only good thing in this movie is the way its handles telepathy so as to spare us of more bad dialogue.",1
Nice Movie,"When me and my friends went to see the movie, i really enjoyed it but friends went over the moon for it. They gave it a solid 10/10, so for the audience that doesn't want anything serious - this is hella perfect.The story wasn't anything new that we haven't seen before but it serves the movie good. My biggest problem with it, was the human characters. Just like ""Godzilla vs Kong"", the characters are flat and i would rather watch monsters fight than them.10/10 VFX
5/10 Story
10/10 Fights.The previous godzilla was better but this one is not really disapointing.You should watch this movie in 3d by the way!",8
Just call it Kong: New empire remove Godzilla from the title,This movie is entirely Kong focused with little to no development for Godzilla just they need to stop the kong agenda. They are just showing him as a mindless beast who just attacks his rivals it's becoming worse of they want the monke to be the main focus then just don't include Godzilla in that for god's sake. At this point they are using Godzilla as a marketing material for their movies and nothing else. It will be nice if Japanese got the rights to Godzilla and make movies than Hollywood.People will compare this minus one cause it is the best movie out there with everything lol. They may cry but they can't deny the fact.,3
An Even Bigger Throwdown Of Giants,"Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire in my opinion is better than the previous film because of how it wants little else than to entertain you and have fun, It is filled with so much monster action and cool visuals, and has a light campy feeling where I couldn't help but have fun.Speaking as a huge Godzilla fan I loved a lot of the little references to Godzilla's past and even how some of the Fights in the movie both reference ( I won't spoil anything for hardcore fans like myself but I think that you will enjoy the nods to Godzillas past). There are some crazy moves that Kong and Godzilla pull off in the film that make both laugh and think that they are cool.The only reason I am not giving this 10 stars is because the human characters in the film, like the other films in the Monsterverse, fall a bit flat but thankfully their scenes aren't very long and the monsters get just as much screen time as they and all their scenes carry the film. There is still more of a focus on Kong in this film but I'm okay with that because his scenes are entertaining and when Godzilla does show up in the film and towards the climax it is pure blood-pumping action from there on out.I would recommend this film if you have liked the other Monsterverse movie or if you are a big fan of either Godzilla or Kong (Or even better both)",9
Nonsensical ride,"I went into this movie with an expectation of surpassing its previous movies in the monsterverse in terms of storytelling,new monsters and even bigger fights,but all I got was a brainless Godzilla getting angry every 5 minutes at someone and a very weak villian with a wasted potential giant called Shimo.i was bored as someone was fighting someone every 2 minutes and the story made no sense and the editing between the human interactions were too fast and choppy.i think I wasted my money on this one and am highly disappointed.they should not make another one unless it's as good as skull island or the first Godzilla where we could feel the intensity and seriousness of both of these giants with the mystery they carried on their faces and movements.",4
Popcorn entertainment,"I hope nobody is actually looking for a deep, thought provoking, brainy movie, because this is not why you go to see a Godzilla film! It's pure popcorn entertainment, full of explosive action, titans fighting and wrecking everything around them without a care in the world. The effects are good, battles are entertaining and they keep the monkey brain in a state of total joy throughout the less than two hours duration! Yes, this one doesn't suck 3 or 4 hours of your life and doesn't waste your time. That alone is worth paying for the ticket, haha. Nerds will enjoy it, kids will be in awe and your inner monkey will be satisfied. Grab some popcorn, a cold beer, and have fun!",8
Epic fail,"Horrible, I want the time back I wasted on this movie. It's like Godzilla and Kong meets Planet of the apes and How to meet your dragon.I love Kong and can tolerate the Godzilla movies. But come on now, what the hell happened with this movie? The synopsis sounds good, but in reality, it's a freaking mess. They should have stopped with the last Godzilla vs. Kong movie.Just No!And what is up with the giant butterfly / bee? I think I must have fallen asleep half way through or my mind must have blanked out half of the movie.The CGI looks cheap and weird AF. Half the time it looks like a game I wouldn't mind playing (if there was nothing else to play on planet earth) but it doesn't work as a movie for me.What a waste.",1
mid,The lack of diolog was very disapoiting also it moved so fast and to say there were some lacking graphics is an understatment some of the mosters looked like plasic and had no shading. I would usaly be fine with this exept for the fact that it was with a main charicter (i wont spoil) also a few times there would be something throughn and it would have no effect. The only redeming quality is the fights these are desenyly good. Also im clnfused on how its only ph there were some brutal deaths chariters being crusher riped in half or crushed by massive bolders. There were also some crigey scene aswel as a sopy one at the end.,3
The Definition of an Entertaining Movie,"In Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, everything deserves praise. The performances of the cast, especially the one of Hottle, soundtrack, cinematography, visual and sound effects, direction, screenplay, action sequences, and ending, are all great and have nothing to be said against them.Regarding the flaws, the only flaw that I saw in the movie is the very simple story and some confusing story elements. Other than that, everything else was great.Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is one of the best action movies that I watched this year. That is why when it comes to the score, I gladly give Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire 9 out of 10.",9
I'm no Stranger to Danger,"Possible plot spoilers.A lizard, a moth, and an ape transformer walk into the hollow Earth... King Kong lives in the hollow earth while Godzilla protects mankind against dragons and giant crabs regardless of the collateral damage. Meanwhile, Kong has a toothache. Jia (Kaylee Hottle) is the last Iwi alive as Kong is the last of his kind alive which is stressed too much so we know it isn't so. There is a lot of fighting going on between the CGI creatures, too much in fact as it grew boring. The basic plot is an ice Tiamut threatens the world. Kong and Godzilla team up with a moth to save the world in an extremely long battle because no one seems to be able to die. This is a kid's film.",3
For Godzilla Fans,"I will say this is a terrible movie if you treat it as a movie where you want plot and good acting etc. However, I am a Godzilla fan so I'm not here for the plot or the actors. Im glad the directors realize this and this movie is mainly focused on Godzilla & Kong...albeit abit more on Kong. All the human characters are for the most part enjoyable and entertaining to watch which I appreciated. No more millie bobby brown trying to take focus away from the monsters. Its even more lighthearted than usual as Legendary seems to be making it more and more mass market which is my main critique. If they couldve kept the style of Godzilla KOM this wouldve been the perfect monster mash up. Overall I'd rate it no.2 after Godzilla KOM -->GVK2-->GVK-->G.",9
False Advertisement.,"They say it is Godzilla x Kong but in reality, it was just mostly about Kong. Godzilla on a logical and obvious standpoint is better and stronger than Kong, yet western directors of the monsterverse have some kind of fetish to over glorify Kong and it was blatantly obvious in this movie. It is bad enough we got so much limited screen time for Godzilla who is the main character of the monsterverse while highlighting a big monkey who doesn't even have powers or relative to the plot, an ancient feud with the Skar king. The Skar King's feud was with ""Godzilla's ancestors "" so it's actually his fight but they some how made it about Kong. And Kong riding off with Shimo, who can actually take on Gojira and not to mention is like 100 times stronger than Kong was the most laughable plot.Either way, It's an alright movie with some really bad direction and logic that applies to the monsterverse showcased. I hope they don't do anymore Godzilla x Kong movies cause they are utterly pointless and just a way to try extremely hard to show that Kong is an equal which he definitely is not by any sense of logic.",2
SUPER FUN!,"That third act was fire! A truly popcorn movie. If you're simply looking for a film that features massive creatures punching each other in the face for almost all duration, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is going to give you everything you want.Synopsis:
This latest entry in the Monsterverse franchise follows up the explosive showdown of Godzilla vs. Kong with an all-new cinematic adventure, pitting the almighty Kong and the fearsome Godzilla against a colossal undiscovered threat hidden within our world, challenging their very existence -- and our own.

"[4.4] King Kong is a ""daddy""","A below-average production where King Kong, Godzilla and Mothra just don't dance in it.

A complete Action packed ride,"Just watched it in IMAX 3D and it is a complete blast. First of all watch it on a big screen as possible and specially try to watch it in Imax because it'll give you a complete experience specially in the visuals and cinematography format.Movie doesn't waste time start right on track with Kong's perspectives and this is literally a Kong storyline type of a movie where Godzilla just played a supporting role in the 2nd half of the film which is powerful too.Engaging story with fast paced screenplay but in the monsterverse type of a film all you want is the battle between the creatures and this movie does that on a high note specially in the last action sequences which is outstanding.Visuals are appealing and it looks good on the big screen to watch specially in IMAX it's just grow your interest much more to the film in terms of cinematography which is also looks amazing to watch throughout the film.Hollow Earth sequence in the film is definitely well choreographed in terms of action, visuals and gravity effects that were add on it.Action sequences are the main soul of tthis film specially last 20 mins is all you here for. Director has given one of the best fighting shots in the climax battle that makes the movie spectacular.Direction is similar to the previous one first it's build the story which is just a side plot of the story because you didn't gonna recognise much rather than focus on a characters.Overall this film will completely give you a fun ride with it's amazing visuals/ Cinematography and the action sequences between between the characters is phenomenal. Must watch on a big screens for a complete action packed ride.....",9
A few words about each representative of the cinematic universe,"MonsterVerse
What's it?A media franchise consisting of 5 films, a TV series and an animated series.Further on, about each of them in more detail.Godzilla (2014)
The start of the movie universe about hefty monsters.Both the director is good and the actors are normal, but still something incomprehensible turned out.Kong: Skull Island (2017)
is much better than the last movie, probably because I love King Kong more. What only one Peter Jackson movie is worth.Godzilla 2: King of Monsters (2019)
You can watch the last half hour. Monsters fight great. That's what the movie was all about.The rest of the film is a strange plot and for 2 + hours of timing only + -40 minutes with monsters.Godzilla vs. Kong (2021)
There's a lot of action, so it doesn't feel as cool as it used to, but it's still better than when it was almost gone.They also upgraded the graphics. Just wow!Skull Island (2023)
is a cartoon with mediocre animation that did not find its audience and died.Monarch: Legacy of Monsters (2023-...)

"An Empire Of Fun, Feral Action","LIKES:Good PaceLots of MonstersMore Monsters On Screen Than Other FilmsHumans Weren't Annoying This TimeGraphics Are GoodMini-Kong Is CuteAction Works So WellSummary:
The latest entry in the installment exists purely for entertainment expectations and it accomplished this for this reviewer in many more positive ways than I expected. It holds a good pace, is fast, and pushes the plot towards what everyone wants in this spectacle, doing little to diverge into complex twists. The humans are about seventy percent of the plot, much less annoying than previous installations were when they took over the story. While it's mainly comedic relief, the humans provide the translation to establish the archetype and help get this chaotic mess of a tale together. Fortunately, there are plenty of monsters to help distract, the New Empire starting to feel like a powered-up version of Jurassic World and give us the anime-level goodness this series is known for. Plenty of familiar faces get some time on the screen, alongside some impressive use of their inclusion that I've been wanting for a very long time. Hollywood's graphical prowess continues to shine well (mostly) in this movie, with sleek patterns, textures, and designs that keep to the characters but help add some realism to their design to help give the live-action purpose. Or, perhaps you are just in it for Mini-Kong, whose adorable addition is one part story, one part pertinence, and all parts comedy as this universe's Grogu steals the show on a lot of aspects, though not too much to rob from the other contenders. And of course, the action is the highlight of the movie and so good for this reviewer. Both lizard and ape get plenty of time to show off their moves in very impressive displays of giant MMA matches. It's exciting, it's fun, and it has surprisingly good choreography that has all the adrenaline-fueled emotions you want in an action film. The New Empire excelled in that spectacle and knew a large part of what it wanted to deliver.DISLIKES:Plot is Full of HolesNeeds More Antagonist Build UpMore Godzilla probably neededStill Cheesy Given The Rushed StorytellingSome Battles Needed to Be LongerSummary
Now it just needs some finessing, once more needing to get the story in check and add a little more composure to make it as strong as it could be. It's campy and corny, summed up rapidly, and uses a lot of conveniences to fill the gaps and put ""logic"" behind what is going on. I'd wished it was stronger like some of the earlier films, but it works, until near the end when too many things just quickly fell into place with that luck only Hollywood can harness. My main complaint is that the movie moves a tad too fast, which truncates a lot of things into micro bouts that rob some of the enjoyment for me. Godzilla takes the brunt of this pacing, his parts feeling very limited, only really being continuously present at the end of the film. His battles are the ones that end rapidly, and though he has quite an amazing finish in each one, he just really misses some of the magic that Kong's battles did better. Throw in those plot holes we talked about, add some cheesy levels that get out of hand, and well... the faster pace needed probably another thirty minutes to get the full effects of the movie (and me more fun).THE VERDICT:
While this movie may not be the cinematic marvel that Minus One was, The New Empire certainly gave me hope that someone understands what we want in this movie and how to bring it to life. Certainly, the story is eye-rolling at times, with some of the antics really stupid and or convenient. However, in its place is a movie that holds a lot of the monsters fighting monsters in some of the best choreography to date in this series. It's anime-level goodness that was just a lot of fun, all at an engaging pace that will keep fleeting attention spans happy, so long as you know what you are getting yourself into. Certainly, the pace does hurt it to some degree, primarily in Godzilla's inclusion and chopping up the battles to levels that can be a tad annoying. Overall, though, I was very satisfied with this movie and recommend that you catch this in the theaters to get the most out of this film. It may not be as artistic as some other versions, and the story may still need work, but it is fun and filled with feral fun. My scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.",8
Hollow Planet of the Apes,"I have seen this series of monster movies on the big screen, I enjoy the spectacle of larger than life movies. I used to automatically go to a big special effects movie. All I needed to hear was the budget was 100+ million. However, having been inundated with many many Marvel movies, all loaded with special effects, I've become a little burned out. Also, I have grown leery of movies with numbers at the end, because it has been obvious studios want to cash in on the name instead having an interesting story to tell.A trailer for the upcoming Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes played right before this film. It shows different tribes of apes engaging in battle. Having no idea what the plot of GXKTNE was, I had no choice but to notice the similarity of this film to the upcoming Planet of the Apes. Kong is living in this hollow earth world, he discovers other big apes that live there, separated into tribes. There is fighting galore. I'll have to admit as much as I like the Planet of the Apes franchise, I prefer other types of science fiction. I enjoyed the Planet of the Apes reboot, but I only can handle so much of the ape world.So here is what is supposed to be Godzilla and Kong, with Godzilla even coming before Kong in the title. Yet Godzilla only has a cameo in this outing. So little as to be deceptive advertising. Actually, humans only have a cameo in this outing as well. It is really all about Kong finding his place in the underworld of apes. The humans briefly appear every once in a while, but all they say is ""something is going to happen"". As for the special effects, it definitely is quantity over quality. Although the movie is nonstop action, a lot looks like late 90s quality special effects. Especially water effects. We are used to ""Avatar"" quality water effects, GXKTNE is subpar.And I gotta say, Rebecca Hall, a talented actress that has a unique 'look', does not look good in the short bob haircut in this film. All the humans in this film don't have much to do, except for the girl with who has the same problem as Kong, she is the last of her kind and feels lonely. The script fails to smoothly incorporate all the elements into a cohesive story. I have to admit I might be getting tired of the monster movies. There is a thing as too much action. I give it a 5 out of 10.",5
Best one in the series!!,"Godzilla KOTM was my favorite monsterverse film until this came out!!! G X K is a fun wild ride. Throw your imagination out the window and enjoy it for what it is.... GODZILLA & KONG in the same movie AGAIN!!!. Been a fan of Godzilla 35 years and have every movie on DVD/a blu ray and this one will join it soon. A surprise cameo, some brutal Kong fights, Godzilla doing what he does and the monsters in this film are some great additions to the series. Skar Kong is an interesting character to say the least. I'm happy the past 10 years we have gotten 6 new Godzilla films, awesome figures. Long live GODZILLA!!!",10
"Boring Movie, Nothing Interesting.","Why do I feel like I have seen this type of plot more than a thousand times in movies?Seriously, whoever wrote the script and thought it was a good idea should retire from making films. The plot was basic and nothing memorable. The human characters were beyond useless cause they were just standing around doing nothing for more than half of the whole movie.The title of this movie is pretty misleading. I was hoping for more Godzilla and Kong rather than seeing them in separate places for the whole movie until the last ten minutes. The main villain, Scar, wasn't even intimidating. Shimo had a lot of potential but they butchered her like that. And what was that giant moth all about? Everything was stupid and boring.And what ""New Empire"" was shown in the movie? I just laughed rereading the title of this movie again.",3
Great CGI can't save us from poor humans,"The fifth feature film in the ""MonsterVerse"" series that kicked off in 2014 with the oddly serious Godzilla, The New Empire see's returning director Adam Wingard (last seen helming 2021's Godzilla vs. Kong) back in the directors chair and overseeing this newest big budgeted exercise in CGI and monster mayhem that provides exactly what you'd expect from such a film and nothing more, marking down another forgettable if slightly passable attempt at giving two of cinemas most iconic creations more time in the spotlight.Achieving far greater financial success across its first official week of release in a global box office receipt point of view, Empire has clearly managed to release at a time and place in the cinematic landscape where viewers are content to be taken away on a mindless blockbuster journey but it's a shame Wingard and his team that includes very capable performers such as Rebecca Hall, Dan Stevens and Brian Tyree Henry aren't able to give us more than a film that has some decent eye candy but little else.Proving even more so that the Monsterverse's biggest problem since its inception a decade ago has been creating a human element worthy of all the city destruction, animal grunts and CGI work, Empire struggles in its two hour time whenever the title characters aren't front and centre and without any human glue holding everything together there's only so much Kong and Godzilla can do, especially when Godzilla feels like more of an afterthought here with Kong taking up most of the screentime in a titan point of view.Appearing to be nothing more than exposition mediums or fact mouthpieces, the journey of our central characters venturing into Hollow Earth that Kong now calls home to investigate a potential new threat to mankind never gets out of first gear and while through this time we get to witness such cinematic greatness as Kong using a ""mini-kong"" as a makeshift weapon or Dan Steven's Trapper performing a very unique type of dental procedure, there's a lot of downtime in Empire that can't be saved by a whirlwind finale that is decent but far from the final act saviour that Empire was in need of.Judging off what we see here it appears as though the MonsterVerse in its current format is starting to desperately struggle with maintaining narrative momentum or a reason for these crossover spectacles to exist and it's hard for us viewers to look at what we've seen here and be excited about what comes next as it's likely we've seen about all we can see from these behemoths over the past decade.With some strong audience sentiment and a likely healthy end box office haul, there's no doubt we are going to see more of what's been on offer here, lets just hope that if it's to be the supports that work alongside our title characters are far more thought out and interesting as without growth in that area, future instalments of this shared universe are going to get harder and harder to endure.Final Say -If you've yet to enjoy the modern day MonsterVerse it's unlikely Kong x Godzilla: The New Empire is going to change your mind, providing much of the same of what has come before, it appears as though this series has ran out of ideas to keep it moving forward, offering up some decent spectacle around a lot of forgettable and regrettable filler.2 alive improvised weapons out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",4
The MonsterVerse never gets tired!,"I've been a fan of the MonsterVerse since Godzilla (2014) & Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is the best entry in the MonsterVerse. These movies continue to ramp up the ridiculousness with each entry & I love it.Now, I will say that the MonsterVerse movie wer never cinematic masterpieces to begin with, hell they don't even hold a candle to any of the Toho Godzilla Movies, but then again they shouldn't! These movies are never going to be able to compete with the Japanese movies, must like with Japan's Animation and Pro Wrestling. The MonsterVerse Movies are the Cinematic Junk Food of the Kaiju Movies.",10
Time sinking move,"Time sinking move. SPOILERS A movie of plot convenience, Characters and Kaiju's seem to be in the right place at the right time for when the plot need them to be. Take for instance Dan Stevens character he teleports from one place to the next and they have exactly what they need when they need it. The big bad Kaiju is no real threat at all. The title is miss leading at the end of the movie there is on New Empire to speak off. It is all ways fun to see Kaiju's fighting and the scenes with Kong are fun, but I kept finding myself waiting for the next big fight which is Probably the point of these movies.",4
KONG WINS AGAIN!!! Great entertainment!,"So while I have all the Godzilla fanboys here who seem to think Godzilla won in Godzilla vs Kong. Which technically he did but also KONG won and in this one as well, allow me to explain. So in Godzilla vs Kong Kong knocked out Godzilla with his axe for about 5-10 minutes. However for some unknown reason Kong walks away. I don't know if that's down too bad writing or direction. Anyway with Godzilla knocked out, all Kong had to do was grab his axe and slice godzillas head off. But for some reason he doesn't and walks away allowing Godzilla to recover. Again this situation isn't spoken about, however in my mind has Kong the clear winner. Now in this one we see similar situation. Not wanting to fight Kong gets attacked trying to lure Godzilla into hollow earth. Kong is able to knock Godzilla out with his infinity glove. And pounds Godzilla till he's out cold. Which means for me again Kong is the winner and could have killed Godzilla if he wanted too. But again that wasn't the plan here, the plan was he needed godzillas help so he started to drag him down to hollow earth. Are you getting it Godzilla fans??? If you get knocked out first in a fight and your opponent has the opportunity to finish you off you've lost the fight. Again the first movie was bad directing for the fight still can't understand why Kong walked away when Godzilla was out cold. Anyway really fun movie really enjoyed it.",9
"Too many monsters and people, which makes the storylines unbalanced and difficult to follow.","Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is the latest film in the monsterverse film series. The film is directed, written and produced in part by Adam Wingard, who also directed the previous Monsterverse film Godzilla vs Kong.When Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) and her team learn that something is wrong with Kong, they investigate. This way we learn that a new threatening titan is disrupting the balance in Hollow Earth and also threatens to disrupt the balance in the human world.To keep both worlds in balance, the team needs the help of Godzilla in addition to King Kong. To do this, they must reunite Godzilla and King Kong after their final confrontation to stop the other threats.The previous films from the monsterverse series received less feedback that the human storylines and characters did not really interest the viewers much. That's why they seem to be trying to stick more to the monsters with this new film, especially King Kong. As a result, the human characters and even Godzilla in this film serve more as extras.Yet these extras do have their own storylines that sometimes play into the storyline of King Kong, but are sometimes quite separate from it. Because of all these extra storylines, the film can seem a bit messy at times and can sometimes be difficult to follow. For a better and clearer story, the writers could have better discussed their story ideas with each other and perhaps combined some things into the same thing or otherwise used fewer elements. Then they could have had a clearer story.The visual effects do work in the film and provide entertaining images of monsters fighting each other. By having some of these fights take place in the monster world, the monsters lose their great preconceptions, which they had more and better in the previous film. Fortunately, these large visuals work well when the monsters fight each other in the human world. Although the monster fighting scenes are entertaining, they are sometimes depicted a bit too dynamically, so you cannot always follow everything clearly. During some fights you may wonder where some characters or monsters have gone. This shows that the film could have worked well with fewer people and monsters. The director and the visual effects team were given more space to make the monsters more his own in this film. For example, they have given the monsters new looks to make the film slightly different compared to how they appear in the other films in the Monsterverse series.Because quite a lot happens in the film, not every actor gets the same amount of time in this film. This gives cast members like Brian Tyree Henry some room for some comedic moments, but others serve more as people who explain what happened, the history of something, or where something is currently located. This can lead to more long-winded moments in the film.",4
Mini Kong got the most cheers in Godzilla * Kong movie!,"The new entry to the monsterverse gives Kong an opportunity to reign as King while taking over a new empire and give Godzilla a new SOS signal to prep himself for a battle, he didn't ask for. Godzilla rules above whereas Kong rules below, uniting them is the little girl who is a teen now. There is more to the hollow earth this time and not just for the two monsters but for the girl as well. How does the Kong and Godzilla learn to team up again to face a generic baddie monster forms rest of the story.When Godzilla vs Kong released, it was my first film post covid lockdown in an housefull theater which didn't follow the 50% occupancy rule and it was the first ever film I watched uncomfortably with the people around. It was an experience on it's own and that helped me be lenient towards the story. Post that and also the Monarch series, I am not too keen on the hollow earth thingy and the awful human stories getting intertwined. As ridiculous I find them to be, the real reason why I watch these films is ofcourse for the lead monsters. On that front, this sequel barely delivers.The film once again failed to get me invested in the human characters and the first half too didn't offer much with the Kong and Godzilla with repetitive scenes as well as the usual monster battle cut off just when it started to get interesting. What this film does get right is by introducing the Mini Kong and the bonding scenes between Kong - Mini Kong helps the first half. The final battle in the second half was fairly engaging and it is here Mini Kong got to shine with the audience in my show opting to whistle non-stop. For a forgettable sequel, this film would've benefitted from more Titan stuff and less human stuff. The IMAX 3D had two close up shots of pink Godzilla and Kong respectively, apart from there wasn't much to boast about.",5
"Kong meets the ""Planet of the Apes"" devours ""Shenron"" and becomes a true leader: King Kong.","Undoubtedly, Godzilla X Kong will be unforgettable for me, as I enjoyed it from start to finish with my entire family. We all laughed and got excited with the magical elements that Adam Wingard masterfully conveyed in what I consider his best film to date. This is unquestionably Kong's movie, as it showcases his more human and emotive side, something Godzilla will never achieve due to his primal and wild nature. Witnessing these giant titans facing off against each other is an incredible spectacle that demonstrates the magical power of well-made films. The director's affection for the kaijus is evident, as is the improvement in the human storyline, where, in my opinion, the human characters are not intrusive. Gia delivers a spectacular performance, conveying her emotions without even saying a word. Lastly, I want to take the time to thank the artists behind the outstanding CGI; their dedication and passion for this great film are evident. Seeing Kong alongside Suko and Shimo is undoubtedly one of the best happy endings in cinema history.",10
Great for kids and young adults,"Too much of a kiddie film for me now. Moving into comic book/MCU territory. An animals the size of a tall buildings moving with the speed of a lightweight boxers AND with WWF moves to boot. I always buy blurays and on streaming if I like the movie but on this one I will wait to see it again in Netflix....if at that. Remember the 2014 film where Godzilla and the other monsters moved and fought according to their size and weight? Well, give that all up. It's an entertaining movie....if you don't mind movies in the ""comic"" style. Also, don't expect anything from the ever changing human characters....they are flat and useless.",5
You want a monster bash? You got one !,"So right away i have to say i have not seen Godzilla Minus One. Yes everybody says its one of the best movie of the year and so but i am waiting for a french dub version. So i can't compare at all.I started watching Monarch Legacy of Monsters but as i write this i am currently at episode 8 and i can't say i enjoy it that much. Its not ""bad"" but there is clearly a lack of monsters in a ...monsters show"" I supose streaming service budget is the reason. Ill review it when im done.But basically i don't watch a Godzilla (or Kong) movie to see humans dialogues for the majority of it. What i want is big monsters bashing other big monsters head and a ton of destruction and chaos. And thats exactly what i got here !Yes Godzilla x Kong The New Empire is really not deep in term of storyline. Yes its pop corn entertainement. But thats a perfect movie for 2h at the theatre. Its a big CGI spectacle and its FUN !I just got what i wanted with this and thus i am giving it a solid 8 out of 10.",8
Um... What? 🤣,"This had to be one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile. Godzilla: Minus One was amazing. This... not even close. Horrible acting, bad dialogue, cheesy jokes, a plot all over the place, over-the-top CGI that looked fake, and just overall... boring. Even the fight scenes were drug out with odd camera angles.This is proof that Hollywood has too much money to throw into garbage stories, but know idiots like me will waste their money to ""see if it's good."" LOL I absolutely hated the movie start to finish.The only reason I give it 3 stars instead of 1 is the music and... some of the effects. I guess. I may have still been too generous with a 3...",3
"""Godzilla X Kong"" - Hyper adrenaline Rush Duo rampages again!","It is really interesting how Gojira can effortlessly traverse two distinct cinematic realms..... reflecting the emotionally-resonant realistically-tragic gravitas of 'Gojira Minus One' contrasted against the hyper-energized, fiercely-heroic 'guardian of nature' persona of 'Godzilla X Kong' where Big G takes on all Challengers with Mega-berserker attitude, ecstatically jumping head-first into every brutal fight without slightest hesitation!The new 'Godzilla X Kong' is by no means a perfect film and it is probably unfair to directly compare to the nearly pristine artistic achievement of Minus One. However GxK most definitely exhibits ample doses of roller-coaster level adrenaline rushes throughout and the many spectacular Titan battles come extremely fast & furious. In fact the one criticism I have is that this film seems to jam-pack a bit too much accelerated-action into its relatively short runtime..... I really wish more time was spent revealing the intriguing backstory of Ice Dragon 'Shimo' to flesh out the Mythology of how Shimo might actually be one of the original Titans and an authentic ancient ancestor to Gojira himself! The bright side is that King Kong and 'baby kong' had more screen time allowing their genuine 'bonding' to develop. I also really liked Jia's side-story rediscovering her hollow-Earth heritage and revealing her direct connection to Peace-Loving mystical Mothra!Overall I thought GxK was most certainly a worthwhile watch and I did appreciate Gojira travelling back to his late Showa Era roots as the ferocious unbeatable guardian of Earth pitted against any and all threats to humankind..... since it was late Showa Gojira that I eagerly awaited to watch as a small kid whenever those camp-Classic movies appeared on TV reruns (""Destroy All Monsters"" was a perennial favorite).It will also be interesting to see where Legendary Pictures/ and Adam Wingard choose to direct the Monsterverse toward the future.... it feels like Godzilla needs an All-Toho Team-up adventure next time bringing back rough & tumble buddy Anguirus and some of the other Japan All-Stars possibly against the Heisei Era villains Biollante or Destroyah. In any case, I think Godzilla X Kong provides more than enough hyper creative-energy bursting with ample excitement, and adrenaline-rush entertainment value to justify many more Monsterverse outings in the future!",8
Disappointing,"Not sure why i even saw this. As i've not liked any of these movies (except for skull Island). But i was told it was so bad it was good and was unintentionally hilarious so i checked it out for a laugh.Unfortunately though its not so bad its good its just not good. Though it is slightly better than the other bad movies in this series the bads still outweigh the goods here. The action and effects are cool and there is actually a story of sorts. But with Brian Tyree Henry back as the annoying comedy sidekick. The movie still doesn't have anyone to really route for throughout all the carnage.Its story is all building up too a big fight of a finale. Which is awesome. But still has all the issues these movies have. All the destruction feels like its not really effecting anything, and the unintentional laughs feel odd when the intentional laughs just aren't working.",4
One ofOne of the most epic and fun movies ever!,"Finally, I've been waiting for it ever since I saw GvK and I'm just extremely happy because it's what I wanted, from my point of view it has everything the Monsterverse has been missing so far, that is the total monster show!I have noticed that some people now say that everything is happening too fast, now they have twisted and say that you need more human story and so far even the human stories have hurt the other films, people don't know what they really want anymore look! The movie is what it should be, monsters! I like it much more than GVK and for me it is one of the most fun and epic movies ever! I will continue to enjoy it because I will watch it over and over again!",10
Not sure why I got bored this time.,"Couldn't wait for it to end. This is the first one from this run of Monstersverse movies that I know I won't rewatch. I don't know what tipped the balance either this time.I've enjoyed them all so far, even considered GvsK as the most enjoyable which considering the big change in tone surprises me.Saying this movie is too ridiculous when considering the subject matter and the previous films is stupid I realise, but I really think that may be why I had little interest this time.Godzilla has top billing of the two, but the least screen time. Why?So much happens just because it has to happen to forward the plot. Convenient plot points are plentiful.The human characters while not as pointless are still ridiculous, a blooming titan vet for goodness sake... WTF.At least the majority of humans don't actually speak and actually play second fiddle for the majority of the film..
It really bugs me at how they keep continuing to increase the humanisation of Kong more and more with each film?Antagonist introduced far too late and really lame in comparison to previous instalments... Just generally poor all round...",4
B movie. Painful to watch,"Bad script (very bad). Bad directing (very bad). A good director would make a decent movie out of this mess of a script with some creative adaptation.Humans? Very bad acting! Mainly because of the directions the were given (or not given at all). It reminds me of Nickelodeon acting. OK. That was harsh. I apologize.Special FX were ok but with too many faults. For example in the rain forest the background, and only the background, is filmed in fish eye lens! So all of the trees are curved to the center!The non white guy is in the film only to serve as a comic (they wish) relief. Bad dialogs, bad jokes (no even jokes), just stupidifing the person.The ""amour relief"" is also a comic relief that plays random 80's music. Go figure!",1
Best movie ever,"1. An Epic Alliance: Gone are the days of Godzilla and Kong as rivals. GXK hints at a legendary team-up. Imagine the raw power of Godzilla's atomic breath combined with Kong's agility and strategic mind. This alliance promises a fight unlike anything we've seen, forcing them to confront a threat far greater than either could handle alone.2. Unveiling New Titans: The MonsterVerse has teased glimpses of other colossal creatures. GXK is rumored to finally bring them to the forefront. Witnessing these new titans, their designs, and their powers interacting with the established ones will be a spectacle that will leave audiences in awe.3. A Deeper Dive into Hollow Earth: Previous films hinted at a mysterious subterranean world. GXK promises to delve deeper. Imagine a breathtaking world teeming with life, both monstrous and beautiful. This expansion of the MonsterVerse mythology will be a game-changer, offering a whole new dimension to explore.4. Humanity's Role Evolved: MonsterVerse films haven't shied away from humanity's struggle against titans. GXK supposedly elevates humanity's role. We might see advancements in anti-Titan weaponry or alliances with ancient civilizations who possess knowledge of these creatures. This shift will make the human contribution to the story more impactful.5. The Director's Vision: The director behind GXK is known for his bold storytelling and stunning visuals. His past works hint at a film that will be both thrilling and thought-provoking. Expect him to push the boundaries of the genre, delivering a truly unforgettable cinematic experience.Bonus: The ""I Was There"" Moment: Imagine telling your friends, ""I saw this epic new titan battle on the big screen before anyone else!"" Being an early adopter of this potentially historic film will give you bragging rights for years to come.GXK isn't just a sequel; it's a potential turning point for the MonsterVerse. With its promise of epic battles, groundbreaking visuals, and an expanded universe, it's a must-watch for any kaiju fan. Don't miss your chance to be part of this cinematic event!",10
NOT A Reptile fan,"I have never understood how Godzilla with such a small brain could have such a wonderful impact on the world of cinema. King Kong on the other hand is a warm blooded thinking individual who is possessed by procreation with human women. King Kong has been wronged and he needs to set the record straight while Godzilla is just an inane reptile with no motivational force driving him/her/it. Put the two together and you have humans who make films about two species battling whatever it is they want to battle and hoping that humans will pay money to be bored for two hours. It is a sad state of affairs when Godzilla has to meet a American franchisee rather than one of his own Japanese franchisees. Unfortunately this Godzilla film has a far more intelligent and motivated King Kong to deal with. This cocktail does not work, learn science before making stupid assumptions.",5
So much fun!!,"Godzilla X Kong hearkens back to a time when movies didn't have to take themselves too seriously or preach some message.The humans are good, and they do a good job moving the story along, but the monsters are the real stars of this show. Kong and Godzilla have very distinct personalities and goals, and it's awesome seeing their stories evolve--it feels kind of like watching the old MCU.Back to the human cast--the main characters are actually charismatic and I found myself hoping that they wouldn't get eaten, which definitely means I liked them. The comic relief character, Bernie, came off as a little bit annoying but I still liked him, and Jia was freaking awesome.Fun from start to finish, I would LOVE for this franchise to keep going for decades to come!!",10
Filthy dirty stinking garbage.,"I'm really worried for humanity that ANYONE would give this 10/10 as some people here have. I'm really worried for humanity that ANYONE would give this pile of dung 3/10 or above. I've never been moved to post a review on here and here I am. This is complete and utter garbage! Please, please avoid.I don't really know what else to say but I can't post a review unless there are a certain amount of characters in the reviews. That's pretty stupid as well! So here I am trying to get to the required amount of characters because I want people to know that this movie is absolutely filth. And not in a good way. In a very, very bad way. It is complete and utter filth!",1
Disappointing,"I thought it was aggressively mediocre, but the atrocious score by Junkie XL made it even worse. You could have completely removed Godzilla and the entire plot would stay the same, in fact I would bet on the script being salvaged from a shelved Kong sequel.The visuals for Kong look great but Godzilla looks pretty rough, especially compared to the previous entries and Minus One. The lighting is especially off, mainly in the Rome and Rio scenes. Mothra feels like an afterthought, her entire character contradicts KOTM. Her knockoff theme sounds like it's AI generated.As for the villains, they both have very good designs, though that's about it.",4
"Big, loud, fun and lots of smashing","I was left underwhelmed by the first Godzilla versus Kong movie.This one is what I was expecting the first to be. Was this movie better than the Godfather, Empire Strikes Back or Jaws..... no.However this Movie picks the style it should be and works on it and it pays off. There is light humour. Silly humour, and it generally pays off.The story was a device to get to an end but hey it works. Do yourself a favour and savour this movie.The effects were more believable than the first one and the action is aplenty.I loved Kong Skull Island. This one's humour is not as broad but hey it's there.This film has more elements and heart than the first one. If you like a good Kong movie then do not hesitate seeing this on a huge screen.",8
Entertaining,"I live in yuck valdosta, Georgia where it was raining all day and had been on tornado watch I had been inside the house all day for the past several days. I needed to escape home for a while I went out to get me some essential mryyh oil and across the street from the shop I went to purchase the mryyh I remembered this new movie was out. So I went over to theater and watched the 4: 45 pm showing. I like godzilla and Kong movies for the past 50 years. This one is entertaining. It had me laughing. And there were surprise moves where I jumped. The special effects were good. The storyline was to me boring.",5
The Most Fun You Can Have at the Movies,"Well, they finally did it. The makers of the current Godzilla series perfected the formula. It's tight, streamlined, and super duper fun. Is it full of plotholes and incongruities? Oh yeah. Does that matter? Not really.It's a super fun time that's actually worth seeing on a big, giant screen instead of a tv. The human parts are succinct and well acted; (Dan Stevens and Brian Tyree Henry make a surprisingly awesome comic relief tag team. I was kinda shocked to find I actually wanted more of them; usually the humans are the last thing you want to see in these movies) The visual effects look great, and the battles are nothing but good time. They manage to tell a surprisingly thorough story with nothing but monster facial expressions and roaring.Kong's whole power glove sequence had me laughing with how silly and deus-ex-machina it was; but again, it's not like it detracted from my opinion of the movie. Now Kong has a cool robot glove to punch the other giant gorilla. Why would you complain about that?This movie is just shy of two hours of pure escapism. Would highly recommend.",10
A heap of disappointment,"A whole load of nothing!'Godzilla × Kong: The New Empire' is not a good movie, in my opinion anyway. It is similar to its predecessor in that sense at least, this is a minute improvement on that 2021 entry mind. It's basically a Kong film though, Godzilla goes missing for large periods. There is less human to be found onscreen which is good to see, but what's added in its place with Kong is just so dull to me.The needless humanising of Kong continues, though this time it's actually done in and around the other monsters because... well, actually I'm not sure why monsters are acting human-like to each other but, eh, the movie, I guess. That Suko young ape character is particularly annoying too, it sounded like a clown horn and looks more belonging to that one Coldplay music video.The whole film feels like if 'Avatar' and the 'Planet of the Apes' reboots had a baby and that's not a positive. It felt watching that it was also taking bits and pieces from other films too, mind perhaps that's just me reaching? The best scene of it all features the two titular characters in Giza, their bits together in Hollow Earth are decent too but their opponents are incredibly lame.Cast-wise, it's OK. Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle are as fine as previously, Brian Tyree Henry is marginally improved and Dan Stevens is serviceable. None of the others are all that noteworthy to me, but that actually is a true plus for this production; last time out I wanted less humans and less humans is what we get here.My review kinda reads as if I hate this 2024 release. I do not, there are far worse pictures out there of course. It's just a heap of disappointment. I guess I just want pure, turn-off-your-brain titan carnage from these flicks, which evidently is not what the Monsterverse is necessarily trying to do... that's probably on me.Catching up on this franchise has made me want to even more check out the 'proper' Godzilla releases out of Japan, so there is that. As for these American ones, I like 'Kong: Skull Island' at least...",5
Story is very meh but entertaining at times,"This movie had the potential to be remarkable, but was let down by what felt like half-hearted story development. My son and I found joy in it, despite its flaws, including numerous plot inconsistencies and a disappointing conclusion. Leaving the cinema, I couldn't shake off a sense of dissatisfaction; the trailers had set my expectations much higher, and it seemed as if the narrative barely scratched the surface of its possibilities. The film's saving grace lay in its stellar animations and special effects, along with the impressively designed monsters, though the performances and storyline did not measure up. While I refrain from revealing specifics, certain segments felt illogical, a sentiment likely shared by others who've seen it. Nonetheless, I encourage you to see the movie-supporting theaters is important, and one can only hope future films focus more on crafting compelling narratives rather than solely conveying a particular message.",5
Adrenaline x 999 (Very Satisfying Movie),"I've not seen visuals so Good since the movie Avatar. They have worked on every details. Just by looking at this movie, your testosterone level will increase to level 99. The Adrenaline will be multiplied by 999 times. And you will feel that you are one of those monsters fighting in real time. That's how good this movie really is. A proper story, well executed. I'm a fan of King Kong and he shall forever remain my King, a guy will good heart and big brain, unlike Gojira who is always showing his teeth and screaming for no reasons. I don't know what is problem with Gojira, he always wants to fight Kong. If Gojira didn't had that nuclear superpower, my King Kong would have smashed him. That's cheating when you can't fight standalone, to use the nuclear power. This is a movie that you can watch hundred times and will never get satisfied watching it because of the visuals and actions. Also, there are some nostalgic scenes in the movie, you will love it. I rate it 8 out of 10. Been a fan of King Kong since Jack Black film and will always remain a King Kong fan. All Hail King Kong, Glory To Hanuman.",9
Really is The New Adventures of Hollow Earth,"Overall - mostly enjoyable. However, you can tell that the Monsterverse is aiming for a younger audience with this one which stinks because I felt the previous movies and TV show were for the adult audience to enjoy. The CGI and action sequences for the most part was good. There were some decent moments in the storyline but it felt like an after thought.They should have called it The New Adventures in Hollow Earth. Disappointed with the amount of storyline devoted to Godzilla. Not sure why he got equal billing since the bulk of the story was about Kong. Had a bit of Planet of the Apes touch to it.I did love Godzilla napping in the coliseum though.",5
"Not Up For Another Godzilla v. Kong Movie? Well, You Get Up! Best Kong and/or Godzilla Movie Ever! Best Action Movie of 2024!","I get it. You're thinking, man, I'm kinda getting tired of seeing all these Kong/Godzilla monster movies.We sure are jaded.Are you not entertained?Do yourself a solid and get yourself to your closest, most favorite cinema as soon as possible.Pay your admission. Get your ticket. Sit down and get ready to be blown away.This is non-stop action.And it's funny. Laugh out loud funny.Good music too: Loverboy, Golden Earring, KISS, etc.Oh, yeah. And there's gigantic beasts beating each other into a pulp.There's that too.And it is aaaawwwwesome!The humans are great in this as well.Rebecca Hall, Dan Stevens, Bryan Tyree Henry.All excellent.If you're thinking, what else could they possible do with Kong, or Godzilla?Go see this.Because they do alot with those two.And others.A whole lot.Best action movie this year.It won't even be close.",10
"Don't bother, they've gone MCU with the franchise","The original Godzilla was my intro to monster movies, and this is the basis of my rating. I understood that they were all improbable fantasy, but I learned to expect drama and excitement, not schlocky cuteness. Instead of drama and suspense, what I saw at the theater yesterday was cuteness, unrealistic action, and wannabe bumper music in too many scenes. It felt like I was watching one of the entries in ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" not the King of the Monsters and Fay Wray's enigmatic companion.After we got home, I caught a ""B"" movie on cable, ""Eye of the Beast"" and realized that despite the low budget, it was far better than Godzilla x Kong was. The monster effects were low budget, the actors not A-List, and the dialog sometimes fell flat, but it was still an okay movie. It did what it was intended to do, scare and entertain me for a while.Save your money and stay home. If the next entry is as bad as this, I'm giving up in Toho altogether.",3
this Monster Mash is a mess,"The makers of 'Godzilla x Kong: the New Empire' should be sued for false advertising: the two titular titans don't encounter each other until the home stretch of the movie.Before that, there's endless and unnecessary exposition. 'G x K' suffers from having too much plot and it takes way too long to bring the iconic monsters together.The film is a continuation of 2021's 'Godzilla vs. Kong' and has a few of the same cast members, including Rebecca Hall as a Kong-ologist.Kong has been banished to Middle Earth to prevent another catastrophic battle with Godzilla. Oddly, no one seems overly concerned that a giant reptile with radioactive breath is roaming around freely. In fact, 'zilla has gotten comfy taking naps in the Coliseum in Rome.Kong is having a much more stressful time in Middle Earth, encountering a race of similar giant apes ruled by the violent Scar King. And in a bizarro-world twist, Scar King has a giant lizard pal who can freeze things with his breath - basically a bad version of Godzilla.It's up to the human cast members to save Kong by steering Godzilla his way so that they can form a kaiju tag team.Yeah, none of this makes sense. 'G x K' could have made for a good popcorn movie if it had a much tighter plot and brought the two title monsters together much earlier. As it is, 'G x K' is way too long, and at times, very tough to sit through.The CGI effects, especially of Kong, are impressive. But the film as a whole is less fun than a barrel of monkeys.",5
Another good Godzilla/Kong movie,"This movie is easily on par with the movie that came before it. The Kong's and Zilla's in it are well done, and the story line is good. I like how the world kind of humors Godzilla to stop the monsters it encounters, even as it results in the destruction of their oldest cities. The villain is pretty dynamic in relation to how Kong looks, with his own look and abilities. The plot, I must reiterate, is very good. I do have issue with a few things, notably the human cast is still awful and annoying, and it could have trimmed 15 minutes off. Overall, the movie is pretty excellent and easy to recommend, and as a Godzilla fan, I liked the interpretation of Anguirus (?)",8
Director Missed for this one,How this movie missed the mark. Need to go back to the one before this. Kong found middle earth. And while there he found the ape castle. As many asked and was stated in that movie all Kong sized apes were deceased. So how do we get all these new apes?Second was the action of the CGI. At times it is way too fast. So whatever you think you saw you would really need to watch closely.Third was the music way too much as it over powered the acting of the voices of the characters.Finally was the over acting of characters. All this we can blame on the Director it is him/her who says how each scene should be. Whether it is CGI or real Characters.To me I wish they would of stay to the Kong Godzilla story line and not that of adding unrealistic moments that just do not make sense.So the writers fail keeping the story line. The director fails for all the issues. Producers fail to realize they have made big mistakes throughout the movie.I was being generous by giving it a 4 out of 10. Maybe next one will be better. Another miss in big movies of 2024.,4
A fun action film with monsters!,"An action packed film where 2 former rivals must work together for the greater good. Godzilla x Kong: The new empire follows both Kong and Godzilla on their own adventures where they run into various adversaries until they must work together and stop a common enemy.I found the CGI in some hollow earth scenes to be shaky. In the grand scheme of things it held up. The fight scenes with these huge titans continue to captivate audiences.Another great thing about this film was Brian Tyree Henry's character (Bernie). Whenever there was a down period, he always made a joke to add some much needed humour to this action adventure.In conclusion I had a great time watching this movie and think it should be viewed in theatres. A lot of great action scenes and fun for the whole family.",8
Godzilla (15 mins) X Kong (Pretty much the whole movie) : The New Empire,"I went to see Godzilla, and as usual, his presence in the whole movie was only 10-15 minutes max. The film seemed biased towards Kong, focusing more on his character and actions. All the fighting scenes were cut short, which was disappointing. I'm glad I didn't opt for the expensive IMAX tickets; otherwise, I would have regretted it later. Anyway, I just hope the franchise won't follow the Marvel path, where all the movies are made for kids nowadays.The visual effects were amazing although it felt like this time it was a bit of a downgrade compared to the previous God x Kong movie. I hope the next movie will shed some life on GODZILLA'S life as well.",4
GODZILLA-KONG need a VACATION,"What they need to get away from are humans! I just came from the big screen theater, and I still don't know who the target audience is for this movie. Lovers of Kong? Godzilla? Kids? Adults? Anime? I am old school Kong & Godzilla, Mothra and all the rest. They didn't like or care for humans or civilization. Today, they come on like they are half human & half animal. Maybe I am getting old? LOL I found some of the characters very annoying and most distracting. Loud explosions, all out fights, monsters now have weapons of mass destruction & their emotions, for an animal strained belief. It reminds me of pet owners who try to humanize their pets, dress them up, talk silly to them and feed them with loving mother care. Your loving pet BOA will eat your kid if you don't watch out. Kong can sign language better than humans too? That means he is close to being able to read. This movie had too much happening to take in unless explained and even after that, it is just too many things at once. Kids cannot follow the movie theme and as an adult, if they didn't explain it, I was lost. A good director makes us sit back and presents a movie to entertain. Here, we have to work at the story to appreciate it. Also, the script writers' have to stop using GOD or Oh My God in these movies. God is the supreme Creator and is greater than the movie world. Mentioning Him ruins the movie fantasy. Kong & Godzilla will always have a place at the dinner table at my house however let's all keep our true identities while eat. Stop with the far-fetched hard to grasp & straining of the beliefs here.",5
"Great for older kids, much better than previous installment","It seems like lessons learned from 2021 Godzilla vs. Kong. This one has much more action time, more exploration of Hollow Earth, and way more monster fights. Just the right amount of human involvement for pacing, exposition, humor, and relatability. The comedic elements land better than in the last installment and the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. The soundtrack and music direction were very good. Some of the previous characters are not present but it doesn't matter. Jia has an important role and the actress playing her is very expressive without speaking. The special effects are all convincing and well done.",10
Movie fit for pre-k kids,"Movie is horrible, the 2 stars are for the CGI work done.Hollywood lost its way and cannot have decent script or story. There is no thought in few scenarios of the movie.You are running MONARC and for the mission you carry a tourist, a friend and kid. With one security personal who you can bet from the first instance that he is going to die.You have folks living on level II of the hollow earth; working on gravity and adding metal paint to make it work. What a pathetic way.Finally it's a no brainer, kids might enjoy to see at the KONG and GODZILLA. But these scenarios are also limited, except for the last 15-20 minutes.I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",2
Godzilla x kong is absolute fantasy full of adventure and pure action MUST WATCH FANS AND OF GODZILLA,"GXK isn't just a sequel; it's a potential turning point for the MonsterVerse. With its promise of epic battles, groundbreaking visuals, and an expanded universe, it's a must-watch for any kaiju fan. Don't miss your chance to be part of this cinematic event.Forget everything you thought you knew about monster brawls. GXK is shaping up to be the ultimate evolution of the MonsterVerse, here's why:1. An Epic Alliance: Gone are the days of Godzilla and Kong as rivals. GXK hints at a legendary team-up. Imagine the raw power of Godzilla's atomic breath combined with Kong's agility and strategic mind. This alliance promises a fight unlike anything we've seen, forcing them to confront a threat far greater than either could handle alone.2. Unveiling New Titans: The MonsterVerse has teased glimpses of other colossal creatures. GXK is rumored to finally bring them to the forefront. Witnessing these new titans, their designs, and their powers interacting with the established ones will be a spectacle that will leave audiences in awe.3. A Deeper Dive into Hollow Earth: Previous films hinted at a mysterious subterranean world. GXK promises to delve deeper. Imagine a breathtaking world teeming with life, both monstrous and beautiful. This expansion of the MonsterVerse mythology will be a game-changer, offering a whole new dimension to explore.4. Humanity's Role Evolved: MonsterVerse films haven't shied away from humanity's struggle against titans. GXK supposedly elevates humanity's role. We might see advancements in anti-Titan weaponry or alliances with ancient civilizations who possess knowledge of these creatures. This shift will make the human contribution to the story more impactful.5. The Director's Vision: The director behind GXK is known for his bold storytelling and stunning visuals. His past works hint at a film that will be both thrilling and thought-provoking. Expect him to push the boundaries of the genre, delivering a truly unforgettable cinematic experience.So must watch it. Best movie I ever had after goji 2014.",10
Why so much background music?,"This movie suffers from several issues that hinder its potential. The relentless background music and sound effects, particularly the constant monkey calls, are overwhelming and distracting. Additionally, the focus seems locked in the center of the screen, leaving everything else blurry. This lack of clear visuals detracts from the experience.The acting, unfortunately, falls short, even making the CGI characters appear more believable in comparison.Furthermore, the film struggles to reconcile the large-scale destruction caused by the monsters with the seemingly normal lives of the people in the cities they attack. A post-apocalyptic setting could have addressed this dissonance and created a more believable atmosphere.Overall, the movie falls flat. While the ambition to follow in the footsteps of classic monster films like the original King Kong is admirable, the execution falls short.",4
A bunch of everything and othing special,"As one person said before me, I would say that LP and WB wanted to eat a hamburger with too much aditive. I would say also lack of dialogue, lack of tension, fast forwarding and too much roaring and screaming. Godzilla Minus One would kick its ass, the company should learn from Toho, I hope they will use the very same money from movie to invest into knowledge, because this is hilarious. Every 12-year old would consider this a movie failure, and I am not sure how can People on IMDb rate it as 10, I mean, it is an insult for an excellent movie. So, all in all, I would not recommend the movie, unless people are eager to see some unseen and unreal Godzilla acrobatics 🤣",4
Its a beautiful movie,"I recently watched ""Godzilla vs. Kong: A New Empire"" and wanted to share my thoughts. Overall, it's a visually stunning and action-packed film. The CGI effects are impressive, and the battles between Godzilla and Kong are epic. The storyline is engaging, with moments of emotional depth, though some plot points felt rushed. Despite this, the movie is a thrilling addition to the MonsterVerse franchise and is highly recommended for fans of the genre.I love the Monsterverse and the other Godzilla and Kong movies and this film was a perfect addition to the series.I will watch it again when it realeses on netfilx or HBO.",10
A Monster-Sized Disappointment,"Alright dude, so ""Godzilla × Kong: The New Empire"" wasn't that great. It's basically a Kong movie, with Godzilla barely showing up. They try to make Kong and the other monsters act all human-like, which is kinda weird. There's this annoying little ape character, Suko, who sounds like a clown horn and looks like something out of a Coldplay video.The whole movie feels like a mix of ""Avatar"" and the new ""Planet of the Apes"" movies, but not in a good way. It seems like they borrowed ideas from other films too. The best part is the scene in Giza with Godzilla and Kong, and the stuff in Hollow Earth is okay, but the monsters they fight are super lame.The acting is fine, but nobody really stands out except maybe Rebecca Hall, Kaylee Hottle, Brian Tyree Henry, and Dan Stevens. There aren't as many humans in this one, which is a good thing.Overall, this movie is a huge disappointment. I just want to see giant monsters smashing stuff, but this movie isn't really about that. I guess I'll have to stick with the Japanese Godzilla movies. This whole franchise just makes me want to watch those even more. At least ""Kong: Skull Island"" was decent.",5
"Great film, pure entertainment!","Easily the best entry in the Monsterverse so far! The critics reviews are ridiculous, it's not exactly Oscar worthy but it's everything you want from a monster flick. If you're a fan of the previous films you'll love this one. Yes it's goofy and dumb at times, however it's entertaining from start to finish.The pacing is excellent, engaging throughout without any lulls. It does move fast at times but at least it's not slow. Human characters and dialogue is much better too. Read how bad the exposition dumps are but I didn't have an issue with it.The soundtrack and synth score was very 80s and worked really well. The colours and visuals were great, didn't have an issue with the CGI at all. The action and fights were great!Set up for future instalments well, can't wait to see what comes next! Highly recommended seeing it in the cinema.",9
Where to begin,"Soooooo.... technically well done.. and thats where it stops..
It's been a long time since i've seen a movie this shallow. At times I just wanted to skip some of the action scenes... which there are plenty of. There is no pacing in this movie.. It's just action, action, action... story tries to do something, then something superficial comes along and action action action.... I actually wouldn't care if the ""bad guys"" won.. even though I actually don't really know who the bad guys are... This movie is the epiphany of not giving a cr*p about plot, the characters or anything in between... its cgi all the way baby....",4
Why do it?,Really who go through this and change things that should not? I was excited to see it due to the action scenes but then things started to get cartoonishly weak ( dentist at the scene to change a bad tooth. Etc) even the slavery scene of the other kongs and their leader cmon what is that?The human aspect was too low and time element as we know in movies doesn't exist but even though this is too much in such a movie but really why change a good franchise and turn it into something you only see in cartoons.Please give a good Godzilla and King Kong movie where each fight monsters real monsters.,5
Big and better with visual treat,"Godzilla X Kong- The New Empire:
Dynamic and bigger characters with a well rounded story makes this a spring bonanza.Kong starts with a bang, and then Godzilla shows its prowess. Enhanced powers for both of them is a feast to the eyes.Antagonist Scar king is pure menace. Little King steals the heart with emotions and ""aww""ness.It's indeed one of the best visual spectacle in the Kong Godzilla genre, and you will have plenty of ""Oh my God"" and ""Wow"" factors, with great build up and hair rising finale!It's a gigantic, bombastic and super charged movie.Watch it only on IMAX 3D and enjoy this mesmerizing eye feast.",9
"The latest big screen ruckus, but the audience get knocked about more","STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulIn a futuristic world, the two big screen titans, Godzilla and King Kong, exist separately on Earth, with Godzilla roaming around with the humans, while Kong exists among his fellow primates on 'Hollow Earth.' ""As long as they remain in their territories, everything should be fine"", says scientist Iilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall.) So, needless to say, things don't, and her adopted daughter, Jila (Kaylee Hotton) starts sketching disturbing images, leading to a journey to ME, and a confrontation with Kong's nemesis, The Scar King.We've had Alien Vs. Predator! Batman Vs. Superman! And now, director Adam Wingard has delivered a show down between two of cinema's most notable gigantic beasts. Well, there could have been a worse excuse to have them smash everything up. The irony that may be lost on the filmmakers is that there isn't actually much in any way of an actual showdown at all, but enough stamping around and battling with other creatures to distract everyone from this. But not quite enough to gloss over all the flaws.If nothing else, the film is an alluring visual spectacle, reminiscent of Peter Jackson's 2005 re-imagining of the original 1930's film, the magic of which I can still remember. The central cast fit their roles suitably enough, with young actress Hottle particularly worthy as the troubled girl at the centre of all the hoo-hah, with a decent enough supporting cast, including Dan Stevens as a 'trippy hippy, Ace Ventura' mercenary, and Brian Tyree Henry in the 'expert who wasn't listened to' cliched role, but none of the performances are anything to match any of the effects or action sequences.There's a lot of roaring and swinging and smashing, the sort of which would look great with a pair of 3D specs. But it wouldn't be wise to expect any more than that. **",4
Phenomenal,"GxK beats all the monsterverse movies.Thank you Adam for gifting us a phenomenal one. As a Godzilla plus monsterverse fan, I can proudly say we won. And for the people who are comparing it to Minus one, I guess you guys don't have the brain what to compare. Me and my friends loved watching Godzilla and Kong together and we were on our feet all the time.I am not going to spoil but you need to see this movie on big screen. Totally worth it and if you are not a regular monsterverse fan, I would suggest you to watch all the monsterverse movies till date before watching GxK.It was a hell of ride. Hope we can get a next monsterverse movie soon.",10
Boys in the hood: hollow earth edition,"The whole hollow earth thing is lame. I can't stand the plot line. I guess everyone else likes it, but it's so unnecessary and wait for it...corny. Isn't the appeal and attraction of 300 foot titans fighting awesome enough? Do we need a plot device to unnecessarily explain more monsters? I don't. The radiation is enough of a background story for me.I liked it, loved the action, the vfx, and well..the monsters. But everything else about this I hated. Which is strange, because the plot and storyline for skull island, first Godzilla, and Godzilla king of the monsters was pretty awesome. The mystery, suspense, conspiracy theory, and downright epicness of those films were phenomenal. But Kong new empire, they dropped the ball. Next movie should be set in space at this point.",5
When Titans Clash and Plot Crashes,"""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" (2024) dives back into the Monsterverse with high ambitions, promising to explore the mysterious origins of Hollow Earth and the ancient battles that linked humans and Titans. This time around, the spotlight shines on the enigmatic Skull Island and its secrets, as Godzilla and Kong join forces to confront a massive, undisclosed threat that endangers their existence as well as humanity's. The premise is exciting and ripe with potential, yet the execution feels somewhat lacking, as if the storyline is just a vehicle for the spectacular showdowns.However, the film struggles to find its own identity within the Monsterverse, often feeling like a rehash of previous entries with an overdependence on CGI. While the visual effects are impressive, they overshadow a script that misses the mark on innovation and depth. The result is a movie that, although fun and filled with typical kaiju chaos, ultimately serves up little beyond surface-level entertainment. Going in with low expectations, I still found myself disappointed. ""The New Empire"" could have been a fresh chapter for the franchise but instead settles into familiar grooves, leaving it feeling more like a missed chance to truly evolve the series.",5
Insane,"So i went to the cinema with 2 of my friends and the movie was incredible. Skar King was very strong and the fight between Kong and Skar King was insane. Godzilla also went around trying to get energi and charging up for an attack which made ud very hyped up. The villain Scar King was also first introduced halfway through the movie so we had no idea what to expect from the villain while Godzilla was going aroung collecting energy which showed that the fight scene was going to be legendary, and it really was. Then there was a whole army which made signals to Godzilla and thats why it went aroung collecting energy. Its just so fun to watch and i recommend anyone to watch this movie.",9
when you can't even shut you mind off,"Ok first of all it has some entertaining moments ! It is better than. Kaylee Hottle interaction was better than Millie Bobby Brown but at the end that was mediocre ! But my biggest issues with this movie isn't actors or some plot holes my biggest issue is the last scene where skar king fighting with kong and godzilla , they literally destroyed the brazil killed thousands and wrecked building and houses ! So what was the point of that fight :) to not destory humans ? They almost did it with that fight ! The directing has problems cause they could brought that fight on hollow earth where the destructions was less and more believable !You want to see more believable godzilla ?? Watch minus one !",5
It is really worth to 3D as it was especially made for 3D like Avatar. The story is also simple and clear.,"It is really worth to 3D as it was especially made for 3D like Avatar. The story is also simple and clear. In monsterverse it is a necessary movie and many goosebumps scenes are presented. Sounds also so good. You can see many of Godzilla new characteristics and actions as well as kong. Human scenes and monster scenes are handled perfectly. In fact monsters are given more importance than humans as there is no scenes which seems to be boring and there is no scenes to be taken to extend the length of movie. Many surprise scenes, actions are there if you see without any pre known spoilers. Watch it on 3D theatre.",10
too much story,"It just didn't stop. The funny one-liners, the predicted story, the monster desktop backgrounds, the predictable twists, a shiny rock, A and B need to connect to save to earth, ...
There was too much story just going forward and nobody made a choice.It felt like the power rangers making a team.Humans are running around but only the 10year old is relevant, as a plot device.I want to be scared of big monsters, but this is Lincoln Kong.Great visual but this is no longer a big ape story or an annoyed lizard.This is teen titan drama. I miss the real cause and influence and serious results.",3
A little disappointed,"I was quite excited when I saw that there would be a new Godzilla series in 2024, but unfortunately it's not very good in my opinion.Let's skip the visuals, effects, soundtrack and others, because I think this is good enough.The weakness of this series is in the storyline, now it focuses more on the underworld and the world above, different from the previous series, the existence of monsters like Godzilla is very natural and no longer surprising to mankind, and this disappointed me a little, because Godzilla's existence should be a threat but now he isn't.The next drawback is that the battles between monsters are that this series shows more monsters than human interaction itself. More sounds Argh....... Uuwaa...... Arhgh..... Hm....... Ughr......... And what is that basically the roaring sound monsters.I think this is quite disturbing to the ears, because their roaring schedule is more extensive here.The point is that this series focuses more on monsters and their roars than humans, even though I think it's better than Godzilla and other monsters being a mystery and threat to humans, there is no friendship between the two.",3
Godzilla x Kong: A fun packed movie,"Godzilla x Kong is fun packed movie, which won't let you get off your seat. The movie's picturization and CGI are top notch. Kong's character development and the bond between Jiya and Ilene has also developed, which is a good thing. Jiya was given a great responsibility in the movie, which gives her a good development as a character, who was thought to be useless by many including me. However, some other characters in the movie such as Godzilla, Mothra and Shimo were underutilized. Godzilla is LITERALLY the King of the Monsters, and the movie treated him like a side character. Adam Wingard focuses only on Kong and characters related to him. Perhaps, he should focus a little bit more on Godzilla, as he plays an integral role in the Monsterverse. I would have appreciated the movie more, if all these points were followed, and if the monster lore was explored even more.I give this movie a score of 9.5/10.",10
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"Only a few months before, Godzilla Minus One gained praise and accolades, this fifth film in the MonsterVerse franchise perhaps got less favourable reviews, I knew exactly what I was in for, but I was prepared to see it on the big screen, directed by Adam Wingard (You're Next, The Guest, Blair Witch, Godzilla vs. Kong). Basically, three years after Mechagodzilla was defeated, Kong has settled into his new environment in the Hollow Earth but longs for more of his kind. On Earth's surface, Godzilla continues to fight against ""Titans"", other giant monsters who threaten humanity. After killing Scylla in Rome, Italy, he rests in the Colosseum. An unidentified signal is picked up by a Monarch observation outpost stationed in the Hollow Earth. On the surface, the signal causes Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the last known survivor of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, to experience hallucinations and visions. Her adoptive mother, Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), who communicates with her by sign language, is concerned because she feels she does not belong on Earth. Godzilla also senses the signal, leaves Rome, and attacks a nuclear plant in France to absorb the radiation. Godzilla then heads to the lair of the Titan Tiamat in the Arctic. Monarch believes Godzilla is strengthening himself for an oncoming threat. A sinkhole opens near Kong's home, he discovers a tribe of his species has survived in an uncharted region. He encounters a juvenile named Suko, they have an initial confrontation, but they bond after Suko leads Kong to the tribe's lair. The tribe's tyrannical leader, the Skar King, battles Kong with help from the ancient ice-powered Titan, Shimo, controlled by the Skar King with pain using a crystal. Kong's right arm is injured by frostbite from Shimo's ice breath, but he escapes with help from Suko, although he loses his axe in the process. Led by mercenary Mikael (Alex Ferns), Andrews and Jia, alongside Titan veterinarian Trapper (Dan Stevens) and conspiracy podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry), travel to the Hollow Earth to locate the source of the signal. They find the Monarch outpost destroyed. After Mikael is killed by a carnivorous tree, the group ventures forward and discovers a temple that leads them to a subterranean section. The group discovers a surviving Iwi tribe, who communicate telepathically with each other. Inspecting some ruins, they deduce that the signal was a telepathic distress call sent by the tribe. While observing Jia socialising with the Iwi, Andrews tells Trapper her fear that Jia may choose to stay with her people and leave her. Andrews uncovers hieroglyphics inside a temple displaying the past and future: the Skar King previously attempted to conquer the surface world and waged war against Godzilla's species, but Godzilla defeated him and trapped him and his tribe deep within the Hollow Earth. A prophecy indicates that Jia is the key to reawakening Mothra, a colossal sentient flighted insect. Kong is found to be injured after he locates the temple, when he is sedated, Trapper equips a prototype exoskeletal arm brace to strengthen and heal his damaged arm. Unbeknownst to them, one of the Skar King's loyalists has followed them and informs the Skar King of what is going on, and he assembles an army to invade Earth. Jia successfully wakes up the reborn Mothra. Godzilla kills Tiamat and absorbs cosmic radiation from her lair, evolving him and turning his dorsal plates magenta. Kong surfaces in Cairo and calls out to Godzilla, hoping to lure him to the Hollow Earth to assist him. Godzilla is angered and attacks him, despite Kong attempting to communicate with him. They have a brief fight before Mothra arrives with Jia and convinces Godzilla to help Kong. Godzilla, Kong and Mothra then head back to Hollow Earth to face the Skar King, Shimo and the army. The fight takes Godzilla, Kong, Shimo and the Skar King to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Skar King forces Shimo to breathe his cold breath and induce another ice age. Both sides are evenly matched until Suko arrives with Kong's axe and the crystal controlling Shimo is destroyed. Shimo and Kong then freeze and shatter the Skar King. Godzilla uses his atomic breath to thaw Shimo's ice age, and he returns to rest in the Colosseum. Jia reunites with Andrews and assures her that she is choosing to stay with her adoptive mother. Mothra restores the barrier protecting the Iwi's home and then leaves. Shimo and Suko return to Hollow Earth, and Kong becomes the new leader of the ape tribe. Also starring Fala Chen as the Iwi Queen, Rachel House as Hampton, Kevin Copeland as Submarine Commander, and Anthony Brandon Wong as Talk Show Anchor. Hall, Stevens, and Henry give reasonable performances, but it is the giant gorilla and the king-sized reptilian that are the stars as they both clash with each other and then work together, along with recognisable movie creature Mothra. It is nothing we haven't seen before, two giant creatures destroying large cities across the world and roaming about in landscapes in parallel universes, but the special effects are well done, and you can just sit back and enjoy the carnage, a silly but not boring science-fiction monster action. Worth watching!",5
the movie,"This is a literal cinematic masterpiece and my perspective on life has changed after I watched this movie. I'll never be able to watch a movie again because i know nothing can compare to this movie. It is so good I can't even comprehend it and the directors were definitely putting some work behind the monster emotions. I had went to go see this having low expectations but this movie banged. The humans in the background were hyping up the big fight and the monsters have this cool vibe. Very lit where the monsters come together and have this big fight, something I live for. One thing I didn't like about godzilla and kong is that they tried to force this convoluted plot to make them team up and it kind of gets ridiculous and didn't feel natural. Another thing I do not like is that they tried to make the humans important characters like I do not want to watch godzilla and kong for the humans, I want to watch it for the big cgi monsters fighting.",10
What a sad movie for fans of good movies and Kong,"I am sorry, but being a fan of Kong brought me to tears at the way this hodge podge of inane script-writing and acting were put out there for ""us"" to enjoy.The actors all played dim witted versions of their abilities (I hope that's what it was and not their best on show).I know it's supposed to be fantasy, but, with all the brilliant CGI, it was completely wasted with the ridiculous story (I think there was a story, maybe, just sometimes) and the less than memorable acting.One scene sticks as to how utterly inept they were by showing a chopper carrying a small bit of tech, somehow miraculously able to cover Kong's hand to elbow when you needed 3-4 fullsize people to cover just one of his finger nails.I am truly sorry to say, do not waste your time and although I am yet to try watching it muted, I doubt even this might make it it's saving grace.",2
Amazing Movie,"Finally the MonsterVerse takes itself seriously. An amazing movie, with a great conclusion. The simian titan society reminds me a lot of planet of the apes. Skar King was an awesome yet intimidating villain, they really knocked it out of the park with his design. I wish they had gone into more depth about Shimo's backstory, but maybe they will in the next movie. Suko was a great addition, and the bond between him and Kong is really wholesome.THE NEXT PART CONTAINS SPOILERS!The climax was a little unrealistic, with Godzilla and Shimo both shooting radiation and ice into the sky respectively. Trying to save the world they accidentally created a nuclear winter and another ice age. 😆😆😆 I found it funny how at the end Godzilla went back to sleep in the coliseum, that was funny. My theory is that since Kong is now the ruler of the apes they're finally going to call him King Kong, which would be awesome.",9
"Wonderful experience, ignore humans","If you love monsters this is movie for you... Kong is very expressive and displays a lot emotions without words making move less dependent on humans. It's a movie of Kong with Godzilla in an OP guest appearance. Need to work more on story... For mindless action and fun it's best. You will enjoy the movie... Slow burn in start and picks up pace too quick in half time.. Little bit balance in pace would have been better... The end felt little rushed but it was visually stunning, personally didn't like the Shiny design of the secondary villan. SCAR king is awesome needed to be explored more.. He was an interesting character.",9
Love it!!!,"A 10 out of 10!!! I love the dynamic that Godzilla and Kong have. It looks amazing pretty good, storyline and the humans are actually funny. I haven't been this entertained in the movie theaters in a while. I love how the villain has so much personality. Pretty good pacing, really funny action scenes. Definitely worth the wait. If you were a Godzilla fan, this movie is Easley a 10 out 10 Can't wait for what next!And finally, Titans. CGI is really good, fight scenes don't disappoint and, the most important thing, monsters act like they should act. There's startegy, there's a lot of preparing, but also there's hierarchy, decisions made out of fear and fights for territory. Writers managed to make the Titans seem humane while also staying within their animal nature.The outcome of that is convincing, at least for me.There's a lot of worldbuilding here, successfull one in my opinion.Ancient civilization, prophecies, stories written on walls, some scores to even. The Hollow Earth looks great, you can see how this whole ecosystems works with its own rules.",10
Monsterverse will thrive and prosper.,"Well, on my second watch simultaneously I was clearly satisfied with the pacing, action, human interaction and story. I was overjoyed that my doubts were just mere doubts. Monsterverse new entry has stretched the screen time of monsters to satisfaction, to the point where kong's expressions are more convincing than most of the actors (period); and I gotta say that Dan Stevens is so very charming and he fits in the monsterverse paradigm very easily. Everything in this movie makes complete sense, even the pyramids. Don't listen to any fool's review downgrading this movie. Just give it a try.On the other hand, let's talk about Monsterverse;
Yes, it will continue and each entry will try to be unique and fresh. Hell, for all I know, we'll see the next monsters flick in 3 years from now and that is my confidence and optimism put together in the monsterverse saga.For all I know, 50 years from now there will be new wave of directors and in those there will be a director that will be wholly inspired by the Godzilla 2014.Monsterverse will withstand the test of time and will prosper and evenly continue it's legacy.",9
"A Marvel-ised MonsterVerse - Big Monkey, Big Fun","This movie isn't trying to win awards, but it delivers exactly what it promises: a monster brawl for the ages! Forget complex characters, this is all about giant lizards and giant apes going at it. It's a CGI extravaganza, and the way they show these creatures communicate without words is awesome.While Godzilla x Kong might be in the title, this is Kong's show. Kong plus One would have been the apt title. If you want less human drama (although appropriate amount especially for the jokes that land) and more monster mayhem, this is the Godzilla and Kong movie for you. It's a popcorn flick through and through, but a thoroughly entertaining one! Just be prepared for humans to get squashed like ants - these titans play for keeps!",9
The best monstervers film,"Wow, I'm just as surprised as you are reading this right now, believe me. My expectations were kind of meh, me personally, Godzilla Vs Kong (GVK) was OKAY, nothing special, maybe about a 6/10So who won this time in Godzilla X Kong & what is this New Empire?... well legendary studios of course!After a victorious achievement for Toho... we all know what we've come for here at legendary studios, & the results are definitely not a minus one...because this time we up the ante, and the people have spoken, we want this, legendary in this film is simply unlocking the massive cheese vault oozing into my optic stems, Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire is a hyper adrenaline rush energizer, it felt like my brain waves digested a high voltage energy drink kicking every inch of my brain cells.Dan Stevens is a solid comic relief along with Brian Tyree Henry. The jokes land a bit better this time around. The aura & creative decisions in this film have almost an 80's vintage vibrant feel, the music & color palette compliment each other perfectly along with cinematography.My issues? Well... why does the movie have Monarch being okay with bringing anybody down to hollow earth? Reliance on slight jumpy exposition, small things that could have been explored a little more to leave more an impact. It's not perfect for those, however I will argue this film was a lot closer to striking close to being perfect than you would think a film of this caliber could do.This is what happens when Cinematography, awareness, consistency & finding the footing on following Kaijus, gets the best of a cinematic experience, it's just as much a kaiju story as it is a human story & It's a Love Letter to the showa era & fans should be proud.I've never been more invested in the actual story of the kaijus until this movie, expositions & humans don't ruin it either this time. It's not anything special, but what is special are what we are here for, & that's the Kaijus.New Empire, by far, has the longest showtime for Kaiju action that I've ever seen in a monster flick. Beautifully shot cinematic camera scenes, there is one specific upside down shot unfolding to the right side up, just amazing cameraworkThe gradual building blocks embedded in the story left exciting awe in entertainment & care of handling Kaiju moments. The humans are just enhancers for the monsters. Compared to GVK, they have a better direction here without getting lost.It's a ride, took the issues of GVK & corrected it more, there's plenty of action if not more than you'd think... there's plenty of surprises, emotional character moments with humans/monsters, & although a not so perfect expositions still a solid fun plot/story following the elements at play... Godzilla X Kong was a lot better than I thought it was going to be & that's worth something.",10
Kaiju sized fun!,"I effing loved it! Trying to find time to go watch it again and again! A few years ago, the Academy Awards entertained the idea of introducing a category for Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film, which, frankly, seemed quite silly. However, had they followed through, I believe this film would have been a strong contender. Watching it in IMAX was an incredible experience; the cinematography, action, and sound were all elevated to another level. While it may not win Best Picture, it undoubtedly offers an awesome cinematic experience. The audience in my theater reacted as if it were a superhero movie, with plenty of ""ooohs"" and ""ahhhs,"" and even some cheers. The film has a bit of a slow start, with Kong heavily featured, but Godzilla steals the show. There are numerous surprises, and the story is more substantial than expected. My only minor gripe is that I kept anticipating characters and storylines from other installments and the Monarch show to appear, but they're only vaguely referenced. It's a bit strange how everything is connected yet not fully explored. Surprisingly, there are no mid or post-credit scenes, leaving room for speculation about future installments. Hopefully, there will be more because these kaiju flicks are progressively improving with each entry. Overall, a great flick that I anticipate will exceed its budget and become profitable. Looking forward to what comes next!",8
Fantastic,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, for it was a mixture of action and sci-fi. Possibly one of the best movies to come out in these past few years. There we're many key parts to this movie that I shan't spoil to the lot of you but every single minute of this movie was a joy. The movie is an action packed film with amazing special effects throughout. The plot ( although plain and simple)was covered up by the great affects, acting, fighting, destruction and comedy. It's a great movie for slightly older children and for adults who are fans of the two titans. I genuinely thought this is the best Godzilla or King Kong movie ever made. 8.2/10.",8
They need to make another one!!!!!,"I just saw the premiere today, It was simply fantastic to watch I can't wait if they make another one in the future maybe around like 2 to 3 years I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.I felt like I was 5 years old again from when I saw Godzilla 2000 in theaters it feels so good to feel young again when you're seeing one of your favorite childhood monsters on the big screen again after so long simply marvelous entertainment, great visual effects, and funny dialogue and a good cast. MonsterVerse always entertains and always delivers for its fans and audiences it feels so great to watch them on the big screen.",10
The Best Movie of Monsterverse. Speechless!.,"For me, it's already the top 2 best film of the year!! The feeling cannot be written or described, the best thing to do is GO TO THE CINEMA AND WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE! YOU FELT THE ENERGY!!! Godzilla vs Kong was very good, but this is a whole other level!! CGI, ACTION SCENES, THE TITANS, THE HOLLOW EARTH ENVIRONMENT, ALL IMPECCABLE!!! THAT'S WHAT AGENT LIKES, GIANT MONSTERS FROM THE HOLLOW EARTH, AND GIANT MONSTERS GETTING BEAT UP! . FOR ME IT'S THE BEST MOVIE IN THIS INCREDIBLE UNIVERSE!!. I can say with all the words that this is the best monstervese movie, Action from Start to Finish, Monsters everywhere, new Titans, Doug's appearance was incredible in the opening scenes!, This is a monster movie, Warner made Bonito In this one, the fight scenes were epic, even more so the final in Rio de Janeiro!, CGI was perfect!, they made reference to Gow 2018, It was incredible to see this with Kong and Suko on the adventure through the hollow earth, encountering challenges along the way and defeating enemies, the scene with Kong beating the gorillas and using suko as a club were very good! 😂😂. The Upp that Kong is Godzilla received were very epic, Godzilla became more agile and faster, Kong received the bionic glove, seriously I had never seen a bionic glove as strong and durable as this one, Kong with this weapon knocking out Godzilla and taking him by the tail Even the portal was hilarious, one of the best scenes, even the humans were good in this film! And there were more Titan scenes than human scenes, it was a monster fight practically from beginning to end!, Every scene was beautiful, and many references too. Godzilla x Kong: the New Empire: 9.6/10. 👏👏👏",10
Love how this movie in 3-D could be insane 3-D ride,Just saw Godzilla x Kong: the New Empire. And I thought it was an awesome movie. It is also really awesome to experience this movie in 3-D it made feel like you are riding on a ride of a theme park.It was neat to see another team up to legendary movie monsters of Godzilla and Kong against 2 new monsters of Scar King and Shimo.I really the new updates of Kong with a gauntlet type glove and Godzilla getting new look.Through the father and son chemistry between Kong had with the little baby Kong was so very cute.Love the introductions of the 2 new monsters. But if I have to pick a favorite of the 2 monsters I have to say the Shimo has to be my favorite. I just loved her design and I hope we get to see more of her in future movies.,10
This was better than expected and I had high expectations,"I came into this with high expectations and was not disappointed. Godzilla and Kong movies have a pattern where they take turns as the lead if you keep that in mind you will love this movie.there are several Kaiju battles and all are great. The human part of this movie we important because it ties in a couple of the past movies and sets the stage for future films. I also want to mention that in the Japanese Godzilla films, Godzilla was caused by nuclear bombs dropped by the Americans on Japan. In the Americans canon like this one there is an ancient history with all the kaiju you can't mix the two or you just find fault in everything. As expected lip, smack the two main kaiju Kong and Godzilla are both bigger than they were in the last movie and with the addition of Mothra vamped and looking pretty amazing I was pleasantly pleased and that's not saying there ain't other Kaju but watch the film so you can enjoy those too.",10
Spectacular movie and better than the overated,"Minus One. Sure One had great effects but I didn't care one iota for the characters and found much of the movie boring. This on the other hand was spectacular and action packed from beginning to end. Some truly amazing non stop Kaiju fights and featuring one of the most epic scenes put on screen; when the 4 major combatants are jumping toward each other. The movie unfortunately does short Godzilla, emphasizing a lot more on Kong but his solo fights are incredible to behold. The human element here is even more duller than usual though Bryan and Dan try to liven things up when they can. But who cares. Most of are here for the Kaiju fights and there the movie excels beyond all expectations. See it on the biggest screen you can and enjoy!!",10
Negative reviews are idiots,"It's like they were expecting the notebook love storyDo you like rollercoasters and enjoying a movie without thinking about over-complexity? If your answer is ""yes,"" this movie is for you.Fresh off of viewing the previous entry into the Monsterverse series by Legendary Pictures, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire brings the superstar kaiju Godzilla back for another adventure in saving the world, and this time there are many new faces including the infamous Scar King, and Shimo.Godzilla's name comes first in the title, though his involvement is belated. A vast duration of the film's runtime is centered around Kong as he explores the Hollow Earth in search of his species.The film from start to finish is a rollercoaster with nonstop action. The light-hearted and comic-book-like portrayal of characters makes the movie appeal to a broader audience without having to catch up with every entry in the series so far.As a long-time Godzilla fan, I can say, with confidence, that this movie made me feel like a kid watching Showa-era Godzilla films once again. It was good fun that gives all of the kaiju combat you need. On a deeper level, films like Godzilla: Minus One scratch that itch for an intense emotional story with the seriousness cranked to 11.",10

"All the people who went into this expecting the Godfather, Shawshank or Citizen Kane should stop watching movies","The ones whining about how the story is so uninspired, how the characters are basic should or whatever else made-up criticism they spew out should really reconsider why they even watch movies in the first place.It's called entertainment, if the movie is entertaining than it has served its purpose. This movie aims to give you an awesome, balls to the wall 3-way smack-down between a giant radioactive dinosaur, a the biggest gorilla ever and a savage, cruel and lean orangutang with a spinewhip. And that it delivers, along with an absolutely colossal ice drake twice the size of Godzilla himself.The action never feels worn out of repetative. It takes breaks to let the viewers breath but then it gets right back to the good stuff. There are several big fight scenes in the movie with the final clash of the titans.The movie is also absolutely stunning. The scenery and visuals are beautiful and in my opinion almost rival that of Peter Jackson's King Kong from 2005 (the greatest Kong/huge monster movie ever). The scenes with mini-Kong and big Kong are also surprisingly wholesome and the 2 form a very nice bond throughout the film.",10
Pellucidar Is Reborn!,"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire: Oh give me a home where the giant dire wolves roam ... It's in Hollow Earth actually and a pack of them are pursuing Kong, he disposes of them but he has an aching tooth so he sojourns to the surface, exciting near the Monarch Headquarters on Bermuda. He has the bad tooth extracted and an implant replacement inserted. Meanwhile Godzilla is taking on the other Titans. Rome isn't wrecked in a day while he battles a giant crab spider, some damage but could have been worse. Godzilla curls up the Colosseum to sleep. The Monarch bases pick up an anomalous signal, which leads to a reconnaissance mission to the Hollow Earth. Kong discovers more giant apes and after fighting with the adults acquires a cute toddler ape. Things take an Indiana Jones turn when archaeological ruins are discovered. It swiftly veers into Edgar Rice Burroughs territory, the Hollow Earth has a lost civilisation! There is a threat to the surface world but to reveal the nature of it would be a spoiler. Suffice to say that Kong will need the assistance of Godzilla and Mothra if he is to have any chance of countering the menace. Some great CGI as Titans battle, the fighting apes are something new, we also get undersea action and gravity used as a weapon plus carnivorous trees. The humans are mainly ho-hum apart from Kaylee Hottle as Jia who maintains her link with Kong and puts in a creditable performance. I guess the dialogue is a tad weak at times. The story is well thought out though, especially the lost civilisation. Kong is very much the star in this film with Godzilla in a supporting role and Mothra in a cameo. Directed by Adam Wingard, Written by Terry Rossio, Simon Barrett and Jeremy Slater. 7.5/10.",8
Kaiju Action at its Finest,"Your opinion on this movie will change drastically depending on how much you can stand the humans they always cut back to. Personally, I thought they were fine here, but there are definitely going to be people who wish they were cut entirely. It especially hurts in the beginning, as there is a solid half hour or so of them setting up the story in between shots of the titular characters. And while their scenes were certainly the weakest, there are more than plenty of kaiju fights to go around.For those who come to this film wanting some story with their fights, there is actually a really good plot thread involving Kong. He is the main protagonist of the film (despite the title implying shared screentime) and the majority of his scenes have no human interaction whatsoever. Instead, the film beautifully tells its story through the body language of the kaiju as they interact and face off against each other.Obviously, people will want to see this movie for the action. And the action more than delivers. There are nearly a dozen different fights in this movie, and the worst that can be said is that some are too short. They're all beautifully shot, catch all the action, and each major kaiju has a big moment at least once.As for Godzilla, while he's not in play nearly as much as Kong, he still has presence in the film and a couple of my favorite moments. The most I'll say without getting into spoilers is that he's like a house cat, doing his own thing and not caring how it inconveniences others.I highly recommend seeing this on the big screen. Get a bucket of popcorn, sit back, and enjoy this two hour ride of fun. You won't regret it.",8
I didn't expect anything from this movie and I enjoyed it however I wanted.,"We have to highlight that due to the previous plot in the monsterverse, any story they put in this movie we were going to accept as we wanted.I mean, let's be honest, true Godzilla fans only want to see explosions, fights, good effects and Godzilla breaking everyone's nerves.The only thing in this movie was that they put Godzilla in the background (which bothers me a lot), because Kong was the center of attention from the moment the movie begins until it ends.We don't mind seeing KONG being the alpha marcher he's always been but REALLY? Only Kong will be the protagonist. But anyway, the movie is very entertaining, which is what's important.If you are looking for a science fiction movie with a deep, well-developed plot, go see Dune 2. Now if what you want is to see blows, blows, explosions, screams, more blows and senseless violence, then you should see this movie.In the end I just paid for the ticket to see fights and it was worth every penny. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT'S NEXT.",8
Made for theater movie,"I can't remember the last time I got excited about watching a movie in theaters. This was a fun action packed movie with a pretty decent storyline. I hate they didn't bring back some other important members (skarsgard, brown) but happy to see Brian Henry back (shout out from the 910!). It's for sure lighter in story than Godzilla (2014) however my complaint about that Godzilla is we hardly saw him. I personally enjoyed the storyline, it gave Kong a happy-ish ""ending"". I've always been a fan of Godzilla and this movie, to me, got me back enjoying the theaters again. Hopefully they don't try to hard with the next one, if there is a next one.",9
Go go go Godzilla!,"Ever since Godzilla: King of Monsters I've been waiting for another clash of Titans this delivered in a scale that Godzilla V Kong failed to. It was thoroughly entertaining, the new story and creation of Skarking was really good and went well with what we knew of the Titans ancient battles and rivalries. It was also nice to see that the score maintained elements of the previous score rather than ignore it and create an entirely new one. (I like continuity)
So what went wrong? The effects are good but they are obviously effects at some points. I think there's something to be said for actual props on wires etc having entirely comp generated effects can be visually exciting but if they appear too cartoonish then it goes against the overall feel of the film. This unfortunately did have such elements, some of the close up shots were so obviously CGI which is where I think they could actually get away with models & mix it up like Jurassic Park.The story is told well both above & below the surface but I do put into question why Godzilla went through all this for an S&M acrobatic oranguatan rather than King Ghidora I don't know. He didn't really need the super heat/thing really. But you know it sells merchandise, I'm sure that wasn't the only reason to do it but it seems like a massive factor. Also, I am knit picking slightly but if Godzilla was now hyper-charged and donning his new pink powers & mega irradiated. Does that mean that everywhere he made landfall post exposure is now a radiation wasteland?Also side note, but what the actual F is up with destroying the Pyramids? FFS leave them be! Destroy something else, the Eiffel Tower! Mount Rushmore!I did decide about mid way that I'd enjoy watching this again. So I'll likely do that.But for now I leave you with this review and this little spoiler! Kong FINALLY gets his crown! Woohoo!",8
The most bonkers Monsterverse entry yet and I'm so here for it,"This is exactly what I want from the Monsterverse, titans fighting in large scale battles with the humans taking a back seat.Kong is the lead here and Godzilla takes a back seat, this easily could have been a solo Kong movie but I understand why it wasn't.Loved the villain, loved the battles, loved the cinematography and soundtrack. It's just a super fun time from start to finish and I had a smile on my face the entire time.My fave Monsterverse movie so far, I hope they continue to expand this universe more and more and keep getting as creative as they please with all of the whacky choices!8.5/10.",8
A great return to the monsterverse,"It was great to revisit the hollow earth and seeing how we've still only scratched the surface that holds so much potential for future installments I found the brief rematch between kong and godzilla was really satisfying and seeing the return of mothra was great and I had really missed the Queen of the monsters and finally seeing the scar king from the first look teaser a while back I definitely recommend this one great monster mash fun with some great monster battles
and always stunning effects which never disappoints the spectacles of the movie seeing the tribe was great and seeing what purpose they serve in the greater hollow earth.",9
There really isn't one word to describe this film and I love that part about it. #ContinueTheMonsterverse,"If someone told me 10 years ago that Godzilla's return to cinema would lead us into a future team up movie with King Kong my inner child would likely loose his mind with excitement. I knew GXK was embracing the Showa era insanity, but nothing could have prepared me for how beautifully wild but simplistic it was. Seeing it in 4DX amplifying the experience of every monster fight.It is a story of found family, building on GVK's foundation to characterise it's lead monsters. Kong being the heart of the story as he finds his place in the hollow earth. Godzilla having presence throughout each scene he's in, reminding us why he rules the surface. Skar king has a lot of aura as a villain too, he unironically reflects the darkest parts of human nature both past and present.Even the human cast is fun to hang around with. Bernie's brotherly chemistry with Dan Steven's trapper makes for good comedy but also the journey that Jia goes through in this film also stands out for sure.My only real gripe with the movie on a whole was that it had so much of it shown off in the marketing, much like King Of The Monsters.I feel honured to be a Monsterverse fan and while we don't know what comes next, I trust in Adam Wingard and Legendary to lead us into future titan adventures.",8
The best Godzilla movie yet.,"The movie itself was shocking incredible. It was more screen time on the Titans rather human itself. This was in fact different between all Godzilla franchise. We actually see a character development in Kong and Godzilla, with a good slow pacing (Kong) and the MAIN REASON he fight with Godzilla, and a fast pacing Godzilla why he became pink. Human actually became important characters in this movie, which is very surprisingly.The movie also has surprisingly fun humour which put a cherry on top with incredible fight.We also got introduced ""protect at all cost"" character, which it was fun to see and can be a key character in the future.Antagonist was good, not incredible but not bad either. We don't see his background or history a lot, but it makes him such a good antagonist against Kong.I feel like this movie was more about Kong so try side and his character development, but I do wish to see more of the big baby Godzilla. The fight could be fast pacing (depending how you feel), but I do enjoy this, this was not just like all fight and win. This feels like a stronger relationship with Kong and I absolutely feel sympathy towards him and his development. (Even tho I loved Godzilla more)
But this was incredible movie and cheers for reading.",8
Godzilla X Kong The New Empire is a great addition to the Monsterverse!,"When I first walked in to go see this film, my expectations were low. Given the last film did not have as great of a plot as other monster verse films. Though when I left, I felt that this film did a great job of giving a good story set in this established universe.This film unlike the other Monsterverse films does a good job of making sure that the Titans get their time to shine on the screen. I felt the film was much more focused on them, and had a lot more sequences featuring them unlike Godzilla King of the Monsters and Godzilla VS Kong. And the humans in this movie actually had good sequences and good scenes when they were on screen unlike the last movie which I felt they were just kinda pointless in the whole scenario of things. The Hollow Earth uncharted areas were cool to discover, and discover that the Iwi tribe had connections to the Titans way before anyone else did. The Titans down there were very well designed, and even the Titans on the actual Earth were very well designed. I even liked exploring Godzilla's preparation for the Scar King by gaining and absorbing enough radiation to take him on. The humans I felt were good characters, in addition to the story, and actually had good reason for being involved in the plot, unlike the last film or some of the characters, just didn't really need to be there.I felt the Scar King was actually a pretty well set up villain in the story. We had some background behind them, and what his motives were, and we even got to witness him in action, which I felt was very cool to witness. Even discovering the existence of Shimo was very cool. He was basically just the Scar King's puppet and I felt that was very cool to see. I felt like Scar King had enough motive, and reason for being a powerful major threat in this whole film in general. I even enjoyed baby Kong and his scenes on screen and I'm excited to see him in the next film. I kind of felt even though it is called Godzilla X Kong, I felt Kong was mainly the star of the whole film. Even though I enjoyed seeing his sequences, I felt that Godzilla was just kind of there and wasn't really balanced out on screen with Kong. But the final battle really made that better. It was a very cool sequence, I felt the fight was very well choreographed and the CGI during it was phenomenal as well. I am very excited to see where the next film goes. Given this film had a good story, good plot and great CGI.Overall, Godzilla X Kong The New Empire is a very entertaining film. It delivers a good story while at the same time giving you great action sequences, and gives you a worth of your money. It gets an 8/10 in my book would recommend to any fan of the Monsterverse and Godzilla or Kong.",8
"If you liked Godzilla vs Kong, this is for you...","I won't say much & will also not spoil it for you guys.Its complete package of Action, Adventure and fun also comedy timings were great. It's time to explore hollow earth more now...
The only thing I was dissapointed for, that the titants were introduced a bit late, but yeah never mind coz when they show up they kinda SHOW UP!! It's worth the wait.I would suggest to experience it on Big Screen.The thing which I usually never liked in monterverse movies is human interference, like what can us puny humans do in between there fight...I won't say human interference wasn't a part in this movie but it was limited. Now the humans have learnt not to go in between when 2 titants fight. Just let them deal on there own.",9
"Not what I was expecting, it's much better!","The expectation that this film would be anything better than just ok never crossed my mine. My son told me right off ""Don't look at the ratings"". So I didn't look at any reviews, which is something I always do, but I figured the ratings were poor.What a surprise this movie was. So much fun from start to finish!In no way can you compare this movie to the Oscar winning Minus One and we all know it's not going to win any awards but this is why we go to the movies. This is why we love monster movies.What an amazing experience this movie is. Guardians of the Galaxy meets the Monster Verse.Something I have to admit is I've never been a Kong fan with the Legendary franchise but this movie changed that for me. Kong was great in this movie but I'm always a Godzilla fan.",9
Epic Clash of Giant Monsters! Zila goes Atomic!,I loved this movie. What an epic masterpiece of monsters beating each other to a pulp until one is crowned king sort of. This was more of Kong movie than it was Godzilla. The CGI was fantastic. Dan Steven's stole the show. I forgot how good of an actor he is. This is one of the movies that is meant to turn your brain off and just watch monsters beat and rip each other apart. We do get more of a backstory on one of the human characters which I like. My one and only critique is the final battle scene between the bad guys was longer it only lasted like 5 minutes in total. You could technically call this a sequel to Kong: Skull Island.,8
"Review of the film Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, Full of Action, Monsters Without Human Emotions","Odzilla x Kong: The New Empire (2024), which is currently showing in Indonesian cinemas, comes with stunning monster action, but that's all that can be said about this film.Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is the sequel to Godzilla vs. Kong (2021). Directed by Adam Wingard, this film tells the story of two giants, Godzilla and King Kong-- as the title suggests-- who team up to fight the giant ape creature Skar King and the giant ice reptile Shimo.As expected, the film tries to keep the audience in suspense with non-stop fighting. Battle scenes come in striking colors, such as Godzilla being pink, while Shimo's ice attacks are ice blue. Visually, it brings the audience to a sensation like playing a video game.While watching titans fight is fun, the action scenes may be the only thing viewers will remember once they return home. Monster fights can be messy, especially the final Godzilla-Kong versus Skar King-Shimo fight. Due to the flash of light, the viewer may wonder what is going on here? Who attacked whom?Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire unfortunately fails to explore the emotions of its human characters. This is what differentiates and could be said to be the most obvious shortcoming of the fourth film in the Monsterverse. This film seems too centered on monster battles.Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire , which is 115 minutes long, actually features human characters who have their own plot. For example, the relationship between Dr Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) and her foster daughter and Iwi native, Jia (Kaylee Hottle). There's also the Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) conspiracy theory, although his jokes are only mildly amusing.Unfortunately, the minor characters in the film seem too minor and only serve as additional spice. This film tries to explore the mother and daughter relationship between Ilene and Jia, but there are no scenes or dialogues that really touch the audience's hearts. In contrast, Kong's interactions with Suko (the little monkey monster character) give the audience a dose of heartwarming scenes, even though they have no dialogue in human language (only animal movements and expressions).Overall, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is full of action, but the lack of dialogue between memorable human characters makes this film less enjoyable from a narrative perspective.",10
amazing movie with crazy expectations,Where do I even begin with this. This movie started off so what good then the action began. It was really interesting and good emotions like a drop on a roller coaster getting the butterfly effect. I went with my three husbands four including myself. LGBTQ community is growing and glad that this movie theater allowed us to live up to the moment. The overall experience was amazing especially with my husbands. I suggest to bring your special person with you to watch the movie. They all looked cute and wonderful wearing legging rubbing on there inner thigh and getting into the mood while the movie was playing. I rate it a 10/10 it ended off with the bad ape dying and me and my husband jacking off and kissing like a happy ending.,10
"G Fan says ""Its Good Actually!""","I've been a fan of Godzilla since I was a little boy, and I must say, I'm really enjoying the current Big G renaissance that is happening right now.I went in to this one with pretty mitigated expectations, the Legendary movies have been good dumb fun, but have been, thus far, lagging behind recent Toho entries in the artistic department.I have to say, I think this is probably the best one of the bunch. Legendary has fully and completely embraced the attitude of the late Showa era films, with a blockbuster budget.At points watching this movie, I was reminded of the gleeful insanity of watching Destroy All Monster or Final Wars. Its a gross out, gore fest special effects extravaganza that looks at every Monsterverse movie thus far and says, ""Hold My Beer!"". They have now abandon any pretense of seriousness, and are leaning into the camp, and its perfect, exactly where this series needs to go. These aren't serious or deep characters, and, lets face it, we're here for the Kaiju, and boy, do you get plenty of fights!I think this is the Legendary movie that ""Works"" the best tonally, and, I predict it will become a modern cult classic because it is just joyfully silly and gross and unhinged.",8
FANDEMICALLY REVIEW'd,"I am already a big fan of Monster Movies, and when I can take my 11-year old daughter and she has the time of her freakin' life this is a huge win for me.Is the movie without its problems? Absolutely not, but what movie is? This movie is a fun ride the entire way through. The set up for the movie is they introduce a bigger threat then Godzilla & Kong. Monarch is researching Hollow earth, Kong is searching for more giant apes, and boy does he find it! Godzilla is out powering up a la Dragon Ball style. What does he know that the world doesn't?At times the movie felt very ""Conan The Barbarian"" but I didn't mind, as a matter of fact I don't know why they haven't thought of that earlier. The big thing I want in my Monster movies are lot's of destruction, cool characters, and Godzilla & Kong to hug at the end. I didn't get that part, oh well. The characters introduced were fantastic, Brian Tyree Henry, & Dan Stevens steal the movie. Also, a huge shoutout to Kaylee Hottle, this kid is going places. She was amazing in the movie!If you want a good movie that isn't 3 hours long, that you can sit and enjoy the movie magic fog that you will be in, you will have a great time!",8
Triple Threat,"No pun intended - but be aware that this is Kongs show! I think someone did count the minutes (Screentime) Godzilla had ... and it is not that much actually. That said you should also be aware that this is not everyones taste. Rotten Tomatoes has an audience versus critics score, that is quite ... well there is quite the difference between those two.I also know that a lot of people in Germany (mostly critics once again) really didn't like this. I don't know what expectations some people had - I understand to a degree what bothered them - one main thing probably is last years Japanese ""Gojira"" movie ... but you can't compare those two! This is an US release ... in the Monster Verse! And it does what it says on the ... well tin, I reckon.The characters are quite fun, there is a sort of throwback to older Gojira movies too (with a native people worshipping kaijus kind of backdrop ... big drop that is) and I'm quite certain a lot more things along those lines. One newer thing (and Ghostbusters had this too) ... this also has a ""hidden"" same sex love story of sorts in it. Ghostbusters was way more in your face, even though it was never said out loud ... here it is more ... well nuanced! The only thing that plays out in an understated way.Everything else is big and loud! With a lot of fights! Yes even the big lizard gets some action! We still stay on track with the big ape! There is a new addition late in the game - but only new to this new Monsterverse ... because it is an old acquaintance to anyone who is a fan of kaijus.That said, the effects are good and this works as a ""not overthinking it, just enjoying the visual stuff thrown at me"" ... although there is one big emotional moment! And Rebecca really sells it! Great moment! After v comes x ... well actually it should have been w right? Let's see what letter they put in between the two ""monsters"" next ... Y you say/ask? Exactly ;)",8

Little Kong got it going on,"December was released one the kaiju movie that this March won award for best effects
Godzilla minus one. It was awesome ye can read my review, now we get follow up to the Godzilla n Kong crossover to what they call the monsterverse. Be honest here i like Kong here then Godzilla cause the ape looks many ways to find more of he's kind that take to new part of Hollow earth, were little ape takes him to the laird of the most diabolical who he's kingdom is supreme Skar king with a wipe control a ice monster call Shimo. While Godzilla travels the globe getting some upgrades. Like that we explore some more of Hollow Earth, understanding the misery that Kong is having for being the only of he kind, there's lots fun to have when he meet the little Kong, been ambushing by other like him n grab him hit em. It was laugh the two problems ve was Godzilla spends most like mention traveling, there some battles but nothing awesome. N human characters that find some lost tribe re related to the adopted daughter oh that's also wake Mothra, to get Godzilla under control, the clashes re main focus of the movie like Egypt one where Godzilla does a power bomb to Kong it looks spectacular on how the sand rises, then the Hollow fight little one throws some mean rock to Skar stogges that highlight, Love the double team is always favorite of mine, that is well known in Godzilla movies n here it doesn't disappoint, on how they throw the Skar king was something didn't expect of seeing.I would like to see the Shimo beast getting stug with Godzilla but it didn't went there.So to conclude i saw a kaiju documentary on YouTube that explains the history of this genre from the radioactive lizard to flying turtle to the shiny ultra something. That's is not going away anytime soon, there right look I did enjoy the movie for the must destruction they leave in Brazil n of course the massive power that this two titans ve, that made me reserve a copy of JL vs Godzilla vs Kong i mean is good if you into this, so here hoping Legendary making a follow up.",8

"A definition of ""Enjoyable movie, anti sleepy""","First of all, dont listen to critics if you want to feel comfortable with this film. Most of the people enjoyed this film & so do I ! The film is filled with fun action funny comedy, and its not even sleepy even my own grandma is not sleepy. <--- (real)The characters? Too much fun. Kong and Suko and Godzilla, Skar king, Shimo all of them are balanced and the character development for the humans are also GOOD.Minus? The film is NOT LONG ENOUGH and the villain in this movie sadly have a screentime that isn't enough but i can say its ""Okay"" for a villain screentime not short. But they also said the story isnt that deep but im not bothered with it.OVERALL ITS FUN NOT BORING FULL FIGHT BUT DONT BE TOO FOCUSED ON THE STORY,",9
Brilliant...eventually,"For the first 40 minutes I sat shaking my head because I was bored and fed up of the bad acting by most of the humans and the tedious comedy scenes, I honestly don't understand why there has to be comedy in every film.I like Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle they were both excellent, but that's about it, Bryan Tyree Henry and Dan Stevens were both the ""comedy"" element but they were both pointless, because this film didn't need comedy.... At all.The reason I gave this a 9 is because of the awesome monster fights, they were exciting and so well done, I love Godzilla, I have done since I was a kid so I'll never say anything bad about him, he was awesome, King was also brilliant and it was great to see Mothra again.I'm not sure what the ice monster was, I've never heard of it before, I wonder if it's already part of the monster verse or just made up for this film.Anyway great film, apart from the humans.",9
When Titans are the Stars!,"I just got done taking may family to the movies. My wife, Daughter and husband, and my 2 grand kids 14 and 8.All the adults like or loved the movie. My son in law, wife, and I liked it the most. My daughter and grandson said it was good and my granddaughter said it was too loud. :DMe I really liked how the Titans took center stage. It really felt like an old school Godzilla feature to me. The fight scenes were great. Some were pretty fast, but they had enough big fight scenes to really give Kaiju lovers excitement.I don't want to give any spoilers, but if you like Godzilla movies this ranks as one of the best Modern ones. Its a popcorn movie all the way. I will not say it's for everyone, but for me. I hope they make more like this.",8
Really fun but room for improvement,"A really fun sequel to Godzilla V Kong. There was so much action in this film and tons of fights, it made for a very entertaining and visually great film. I do wish they would've hurried up the story a bit more as it took most the film for Godzilla to come to Kong and I feel like Godzilla was a little underwhelming in this too but when he joined Kong he was badass. Kong was basically the main character of this film and he had more personality in this and made for an entertaining character as we explore this new realm and meet new characters. The Scar King was actually pretty cool, he was badass and brutal aswell as Shimo who was just awesome. The final fight scene was done pretty quick and I feel like it could've been better but it was very entertaining stuff. The lore was all really interesting like the Scar King lore and more stuff with how Monarch operates. There was some great visuals in this too even epic ones like Godzilla diving off a mountain into the ocean was so cool. The music was pretty great too. Overall it's a really entertaining movie I just wish there was more of it so that it could've been better. Super fun though and a great watch.",8
"Surprisingly And Actually Delivers A Solid, Entertaining, And Epic Of A Sequel","8.5/10
I mean you can't lie that everytime all of these monsters are on the screen it was just epic, and what fascinating me the most in this one is how good of a execution Adam Wingard made to these monsters characters that even the scene with only the monsters are very good and really working, the personality build works very well and that is the one aspects i appreciate the most, and while some of the flaws are still from the human aspects, they are not boring and that's the most important, i actually can say that i still like all the human characters, just some flaws execution, and some CGI and special effects could get a bit distracting, this is a Kong movie to me in terms of who supports who, just like Godzilla Vs Kong but i'm more on the Godzilla side on that one, in this one the team up, the rematch, and the final battle was pretty awesome, and while i do still like Godzilla Vs Kong more with the reason that it such an event at the time and somehow i'm more connected to the human more on that, the execution was better, and again i feel like they actually even cut the human part even more in this one, also the final battle between Godzilla Vs Kong was just uncompetetable, overall in what most people would think a cash grab and forced continuation story, and that might be the case but as long as it delivers, and now i see the result, Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire surprisingly and actually delivers a solid, entertaining, and epic of a sequel.",8
This movie looks and is AWESOME!!!!,"I went to the theaters the day it came out and it was awesome. The villains are very good, loved shimos design. The humour was great along with the story, designs, and human characters. The only downside was there was only 8 named kaiju and I wish there was more. Godzilla new design has grown on me a lot showing off his new shoulder spikes and tail. Kings glove was pretty awesome too but he barely had any updates. Skar king and shimo are also very cool. The idea of shimo being controlled by the skar king is awesome. The death of skar was also cool AF, being frozen and smashed to bits is one of the sickest death scenes ever.",10
One of the best monster movies ever!,"I've seen it twice and both times i absolutely loved it. This movie was amazing and is now one of my ultimate favorite movies...ever. I highly recommend to everybody to go and see this movie if you haven't already. Hope to see more of the Godzilla x Kong team in the future. Loved every second, it was fantastic. The villain was so creepy/scary, the visuals were amazing, my boy Godzilla was not playing around in this movie, Kong turned way up in this movie, it was awesome to see familiar faces and new ones. Not a second felt wasted or drawn out or unnecessary, and it was amazing start to finish.",10
"Not perfect, but still a great movie","King Kong and Godzilla are my most favorite movie monsters. Now the parts with them, little Kong, Mothra, the Scar King and Shimu were the best parts. I didn't care much for the parts with the human characters, except maybe those Iwi people who were deaf and could only communicate through sign language. Also, the really best part was the final battle between Godzilla, Kong and the Scar King and Shimu. Now I'm not gonna spoil anymore of this film, but I will tell you that this sequel in the monster-verse is worth the watch. Tons of action and awesome effects. Not perfect, but still a great movie. Eight out of ten.",8
Great Popcorn Movie with huge special effects,"See it on IMAX, that is my first recommendation. Get ready to completely suspend disbelief as you go on a wild an whacky journey into pure, wonderfully silly Mega-Monster romping! They even throw in some Titan lore, and you do get to see several of the greats beside Kong and Godzilla. Do not expect realism, that would be ridiculous. It's just a really fun mega-monster movie with wall to wall special effects and CGI. Kong is probably more endearing than ever, and they do a lovely treatment on Mothra as well. I loved these movies as a kid, and I am happy to keep supporting them. About 80% Action and only 20% drama fyi. Grab that popcorn and enjoy.",8
The best godzilla movie in the franchise,"In the colossal world of monster movies, Godzilla: The New Empire stands tall as a true titan of the genre. Adam Wingard delivers a masterpiece that not only honors the legacy of the iconic lizard king but propels it to new heights of greatness. A very fun and entertaining movie. The visual effects are nothing short of breathtaking, with Godzilla and his fellow kaiju rendered in stunning detail. The pacing is also excellent despite the long runtime. The story is as good as the creatures themselves weaving a tale of survival and sacrifice. The movies is best watched on the big screen in IMAX. A great blockbuster film. Overall 10/10.",10
Best Kong and Godzilla Movie!!!!,"This movie to me was on par with all the avenger movies. In fact, they took the boring fights and running typically Godzilla one-dimensional plot and they turned it into a brilliant story-fairy tale-adventure.The script is brilliant. It is finally a story and well thought out. Lots of emotion, lots of action and many twists. No longer it is me-kong... me godzilla...me fight and destroy u and buildings...arr...arr. No! It is now a re-watchable story with a great plot!Gorgeous camera work, no shaky cameras, beautiful pans of all the scenery. You can appreciate all the SFX and the world-building;A solid 10/10. I'll be rewatching it in a couple of year and I can't say that for most movies.",10
A Throwback to Showa-Era Action and Camp,"Watched Godzilla X Kong :The New Empire feautring Rebecca Hall(The Prestige) as Ilene Andrews,Dan Stevens(Legion) as Trapper, Brian Tyree Henry(Eternals, Spider-Man:Across The Spiderverse) as Bernie Hayes, Alex Ferns(Star Wars Andor) as Mikael, Kaylee Hottle as Jia(Godzilla Vs Kong) and Fala Chen(Shang Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings) as Iwi Queen.I had a blast glad tied it back to KOTM even more this time I didn't mind Godzilla usages when he came on screen it meant something plus he's already has 2 films and series dedicated to him also love Godzillas and Kongs dynamic Skar King was a great villain though nothing beats King Ghidorah they were right about Showa Era Esque action also Jia & Trapper were great for the Human characters.this film isnt Minus One Nor Should it be its A Throwback to Showa-Era Action and CampAmazing Score By Junkie XL(Mad Max Fury Road), Cinematography By Ben Seresin(The Mother) and Direction By Adam Wingard(The Guest). A Throwback to Showa-Era Action and Camp 8/10.",8
One of the best movies I ever seen (spoilers),It was a great movie and had TONS of action scenes they had some great scenes some funny scenes sad scenes but most Importantly the villain while the main villain was like a tennis ball it was kind of a weak villain while it was mainly kongs story i wanted more of Godzilla because he started the Monsterverse it also had about 1 minute fight scenes for some of them like Tiamat he didn't even last 40 seconds but the good part about this movie is the funny parts the fight scenes and how kong meets his family the final fight scene was amazing the Skar king Shimo and the great apes fighting kong was great I hope they do another movie.,8
Really loved it a lot,Look I get people are mad that it's very funny and all with a lot of things happening but like that's not what happened back in the 60s and 70s when they made Godzilla funny like I loved this movie a lot many of my friends did the human acting was ok and all but Godzilla and Kong had many great scenes and I really liked most of the lore to it. But yeah I get that people also hate it cause they want to compare it to Godzilla minus one as well but they ain't the same they different really the monster verse is very entertaining and fun and make many fun movies so don't care what anyone says 10/10.,10
Loved it!,I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly this movie brought me into it and kept me swept up in the mythical action sequences that were paired with some great cinematography and acting. I was really impressed with Godzilla x Kong and I felt that it was a thrilling and fun movie that fans of the Titan Monsters will appreciate. The introduction of the mini kong was particularly cute and it reminded me of seeing Diddy and Donkey Kong in action - as a tongue-in-cheek comedic relief and element of surprise thrown into an otherwise compelling story that I thoroughly appreciated. I think that it will be a fan favorite in this household.,10
Excited for the next one!,"No complaints here. Never a dull moment and CGI and live are equally tolerable. Story may not be as great as everyone would think, but it was still well written. A slight humor and not forced which is good if not better with this type of movie. Glad it's not directed by Gunn or Waititi!Loved that Mothra returned and introduced new titans both passive, ally(ies) and enemies alike. Good to see Jia all grown up (a little bit).I hope they keep making movies like this and never die down. The only thing that could stop this is negative reviews from critics who failed as an actor or never became one! Y'all need an actual job! Fracking losers! LMAO.",10
Godzilla & Kong team up in a Monsterverse Avengers Movie,"OK, I'm biased as I loved Godzilla vs Kong and loved the preview scenes so couldn't wait for this one and had Godzilla x Kong rated 10 stars before I even walked into the theater - but it fully earned that rating, it was such a fun movie to watch, I read a complaint that there was not enough time with Godzilla, it was Kong's story so naturally the focus was on him but it looked like time between Godzilla & Kong was evenly split to me, if anything the Humans took too much time away from both, as always the Humans were the weakest part of the movie and got in the way of the action, but at least they were somewhat interesting this time around (The Dr. Dolittle of the Monsterverse was pretty funny) loved the Monster Mash fight scenes (there was a certain Batman vs Superman aspect to Mothra being the Monster that both Godzilla and Kong liked - lol) - the Cairo fight was epic if to short and the big Rio finish (imagine sunning yourself on a Rio beach when the Monsterverse descends on you) was awesome but felt a bit rushed and I would have liked a final Godzilla/Kong scene to wrap things up, but those are minor quibbles as seeing the Big Boys join forces on the Big Screen was a blast and the film was so fast paced it felt much shorter than its 2 hour run time - the ending set up nice for a sequel and have to say I loved the recent Godzilla vs Kong vs The Justice League Comic and if that is where they go next it would be awesome.",10
godzilla y kong,"-Wow, I'm just as surprised as you are reading this right now, believe me. My expectations were kind of meh, me personally, Godzilla Vs Kong (GVK) was OKAY, nothing special, maybe about a 6/10So who won this time in Godzilla X Kong & what is this New Empire?... well legendary studios of course!After a victorious achievement for Toho... we all know what we've come for here at legendary studios, & the results are definitely not a minus one...-Wow, I'm just as surprised as you are reading this right now, believe me.

Best Showa Era Movie,"Godzilla X Kong is the best of the Showa ear movie of Godzilla. It's a fun ride with monster battles some characters development especially with Jia. Adds to the monsterverse lore of the monsters themselves it knows it's goofy and it doesn't shy away from it. Although this movie may not be recognized at the Oscars it's still a good flick. All in all this movie os dedicated to the older Godzilla fans as it has the goofy feel as the older movies, if your looking for a serious movie and drama In-depth character development than this movie is not for you but you love big monster this is your movie.",9
Immersive and beautiful,"Reading through the reviews, it's the same every time with these kinda films, from marvel to transformers, there's those people that will hate on everything they do, yet keep going to more films, disregard anyone who gave this under 6, they never saw it or just likes to be negative. It's so tedious the same arrogance and sabotage on giving big franchises awful scores.The film itself was great, went really quickly, the design and the effects were top draw, they had a great range of characters who weren't one dimensional, I enjoyed that a few side characters were more versatile here, the fight scenes were great. The little girl to be so good with no lines!!! Credit to her.Honestly I can't understand unless you hate these types of movies how you'd not like it.",10
Awesome!!! Worth your money and time,Starts off strong and ends with huge bang! The effects were crazy. The story was great. Soundtrack is freaking awesome! Great acting. Kong was off the chain. Godzilla crazy good. I didn't think I was going to like it but I was 100% wrong. I loved it!! Just wish I would have waited to see at Imax theater. Brother in-law was in charge of tickets. I haven't been to the movies in a very long the and I was not disappointed. I think I am done with watching at home. The theater was awesome. I could feel every punch Kong delivered and the effects on huge screen were incredible. This movie is reason I will be going back to the theaters from now on. Very glad I went to see it. You will love it if you are King Kong or Godzilla fan. It doesn't disappoint.,8
BIG KAIJU FIGHTS! YES!,"Short answer: awesome fights and story wasn't bad either loved the action and enjoyed the new titansLong answer: I love big kaijus fighting and it was a treat to see what I wanted. I loved watching Godzilla and kong fight, also loved Kong's development. The story wasn't a complete masterpiece with no errors but it was still great. The new characters were great too and it was a blast I was taken to another world which is exactly why we go to the movies not to always see a no error masterpiece but a movie to transport us to another world and entertain us. But the main thing this movie has is it's action, like it's the one of the best monster verse movies if not the best in my opinion. 🔥💯",8
One of the few amazing films left from cinema,"This is the only film I've put the effort into watching it in cinema ever since what felt like forever and i don't regret it. I really like shrek kong in the beginning. Him being the main focus on this one sells it for me (sorry godzilla). The humans story also packed neatly, not dwelled too much nor too little. I also like how they use underrated actors and not the over saturated ones, thank you it's not Chris Pratt again. On the other hand I don't really like how mothra became too much of a hacks plot device in this one, kinda wish they did more of her and shimo. Overall this is a really fun and amazing movie, I recommend watching it in cinema for the full experience.",9
A feast for the senses and so much Kaiju fun!,"My buddy, Kristian Harloff from the best entertainment podcast, The Big Thing said it best. If you're excited about this movie and you read or hear a review whose major point is ""In this movie, you don't care about the humans..."" disregard it and see it anyway. Those people are going into this movie with the wrong mindset and they don't really want to see a Kaiju aka giant monster movie. Of course the human story doesn't matter, it's not their story. I also have a counterpoint. I DID care about the humans. They are a great complement to the true stars of this flick. Godzilla, Kong and MOTHRA!! Godizilla Minus 1 was an anomaly. Not even the original 1954 flick had the human story that Minus 1. This is not a comparable flick. This movie is so much fun and I am loving this Monsterverse including the Kurt and Wyatt Russell led TV series, Monarch. It all started with Gareth Edwards Godzilla in 2014. I eagerly await Godzilla and Kong's next adventure.",8
Overall a good experience,"I've always been into these kinds of films, total 'guy movies' with fights and giant monsters. However, I find the movie to be too futuristic with this new stage of hollow earth. Scar king could have been fleshed out a bit more, don't know how, but I guess that's also why I'm not a film director. I do get surprised though by how they come up with new ideas that don't really have much significance, the film lacks of a ""classic"" storyline (when the end is reached, the film series is over). This movie was just about 'killing yet another titan that would threaten humanity.' I feel like they keep adding more and more with each film, so eventually, I could imagine the last film not really living up to expectations because they've simply made the universe too big and don't have the ""classic"" storyline.",8
"Fun Monster action, no more no less.","I guess Warner Bros is learning that people don't watch these movies for the human characters but the monsters instead. There are many monster fights and they are all very well done. Unfortunately they could be much longer, especially the final showdown.Kong is once again our main hero and he sure shows alot of emotion in this movie, which I really like. It makes him in fact more 3-dimensional than most human characters in this movie. Speaking about the human characters. I don't find the humans in the monsterverse movies as boring as most other people on the internet. They are all fine, though two of them are to much of comic relief characters, which modern movies unfortunately seem to add more and more due to Marvels popularity.Godzilla is the one that gets most monster fights despite having less screentime than Kong. Those fights are all good but come pretty short. I would have liked some more Godzilla action. Godzilla himself acts more of an anti hero like in the last monsterverse movie, which works pretty well.The main villain Scarking is entertaining but for sure the least intiminating monsterverse villainwithout his ""sidekick"".All in all its a most watch in theaters due to the action and visuals but don't expect this movie to have Minus One Storytelling.8.5/10 atomic breaths.",9
Best US Godzilla movie yet,"Finally the monsters take 80% of the screen time and that's a really enjoyable ride.Sure the plot is cheesy and full of holes but, let's face irt, these kind of movies are there for you to watch big monsters fight each other and tear down cities and, on that point, it sure delivers.The best thing is, the human plot takes a backseat this time around and we really focus on the titans. CGI is breathtaking at times and the action pretty re;lentless.Best popcorn movies of 2024 so far, I do recommend it eventho the plot and chartacters are pretty weak. That's a tton more fun than this Monarch show tho.",8
Kong and Godzilla rule the box office after 91 to 70 years!,King Kong was my favorite childhood movie after 19 years when I saw King Kong in theaters December 2005 during Christmas break with my dad sis and grandma. It blew me away. Godzilla was one of my second favorite movies. 1998 Godzilla was such a great movie directed by Roland emmerich . But Gareth Edwards Godzilla was by far the most remarkable films ever created. It was Godzillas 60th Anniversary and that was such a treat to see a new godizlla . Shin Godzilla is the best movie ever created. Godzilla had a head on his tail and that made him more powerful and he was gonna breed his own offsprings but then he froze . Godzilla vs Kong was such a remarkable hit . Kong skull island it made sense of where he came from and how Godzilla didn't know he was out there . But after they came face to face it was mine blowing . I hope they do the final chapter of the monster verse . And Godzilla faces the new monster destroyia and Godzilla sacrifices himself to save the world and kong dies in New York city as his final battle with the skull crawler .,10
Rushed Ending,"It is a very good movie but the ending seems a bit rushed. And also the titans were too much human impression; Kong's facial expressions is too much for a non human, almost like they are trying too hard to add humour to the movie which nearly destroyed a great piece of work. I feel like they haven't showed us enough about what happened at the end, very little details, those details if included would've given the movie a chance to get 10/10 rating. But aside from that everything about the movie is great.Haven't enjoyed a movie of this genre since the very first Jurassic park movie. I recommend watching it at night during the weekend.",8
FISTICUFFS TO END ALL FISTICUFFS...!,"The titans of fun are back in this 5th entry in the series. Smartly scaling back the human component, we focus on an impending force which has Kong curious in center Earth while back on terra firma, Godzilla is making quick work of any rogue titans rampaging around the globe. During a skirmish w/some jackal like creatures, Kong opens a fissure in the ground which leads him to an even lower strata of his world where a young & smaller ape greets him. In a failed attempt to jump Kong essentially, the young primate leads him back to his leader's stronghold where an ice breathing titan is at his beck & call which scientist present, Rebecca Hall, a veteranian, Dan Stevens, a paranoid blogger, Oscar nominee Brian Tyree & Hall's mute charge, Kaylee Hottle, all figure Godzilla must partner w/Kong to defeat this insistent enemy. Returning director, Adam Wingard, keeps the fights between the beasts front & center while all the explaining verbiage is left on the sidelines where it needs to be making this an endurance test for the paying audience on how loud & bright they want their mayhem to come across.",8
Perfect popcorn flick,"I had zero expectations going into this except I wanted to be entertained. I was, thoroughly. If you can just enjoy what Godzilla x Kong is trying to give you, you'll have a good time. You either know by now if these movies are for you or not, so understand this won't change your mind on the genre. It is outrageous, fictional fun that is meant to be enjoyed with popcorn, candy and friends. I loved that the movie is pretty much action from the start, doesn't really try to over explain anything and just let's you enjoy what it's presenting you. It's not a deep pool, but it is a lot of fun to swim in.",8
Don't listen to the nay sayers,"All I've got to say is if you expected it to be a one big action pack movie you will be absolutely entertained all the way through but if you're like the people that give it low reviews that expect it to be a dark more serious monster movie like minus one You'll be disappointed, and you shouldn't even be thinking that way in the first place. If you just look at the marketing of the movie you would know that's nothing like that at all and for the just under two hour period of the movie I think this was a pretty good one actually I think it's the best one for obvious reasons and there's a lot more monsters than human characters which is what we wanted from the start and you see a lot of people saying there's not enough human characters on screen that will give you an interesting enough story, they say because it's not humans they focusing on like they wanted it to be in the first place.",10

Reptiles X Mammals,"I am slightly relieved that Kong doesn't end up eaten by Godzilla. He did a great job at taking the barbaric beast. It was lovely to see Kong amongst his peers, although I kind of lost the plot on how he was reunited in with them when they were MIA in Kong Vs Godzilla. I must not have been paying attention but I am sure we were given the suggestion that they went extinct in the first prequal. I absolutely loved the humour, soundtracks were befitting. I didn't quit understand where Little Zilla came from. I am sure Godzilla and son is somewhere in the works. I expected a little more from Tiamat, she came to an anti climatic end. I would've expected to see more of her abilities as her reputation was not becoming of her end. Hopefully she left an egg somewhere. I absolutely loved Kongs sidekick despite the fact he was ginger, which really reflected his firey spirit. We really did come a long way from Kong habituating in the jungle to originating from inner earth, it's a big gap.",8
I wanted brainless entertainment and that's what got...I'm happy.,"Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire is more of the bombastic craziness you've come to expect from the MonsterVerse.At this point into the franchise you either accept what these films are, go with it and have fun or you don't. They're dumb fun, switch your brain off spectacles.Most people watch the MonsterVerse to see giant monsters beat each other up whilst destroying cites / landmarks with great CGI & cool visuals. The film delivers on all that. I mean we get Kong using a child ape as a weapon to smack around some adult apes and then Godzilla performing wresting moves on Kong.The human scenes do continue to be the least interesting & entertaining parts of these films, with the exception of Jia and her bond with Kong & connection to Hollow Earth. A big selling point of the film is Godzilla & Kong teaming up, but they spend most of the film apart and don't actually team up until the 3rd act. Also, just like in GVK, I felt they've underused Godzilla and not given him much to do, especially compared to Kong.Overall I had a damn fun time checking this out. It entertained me and put me in a good mood. When it comes to this particular franchise that's all I need.",8
Godzilla X Kong is an Entertaining Blast,"Godzilla X Kong is bombastic!WOW!!! Go to the movie for spectacular visual effects, loud background music and to just have a blast.The story seems illogical and doesn't make sense, but the story telling in the movie is good. The director has done a fantastic job in not making the movie boring. The movie belongs to Kong and shows his journey all along. Godzilla is very powerful; thanks to all the radiation he consumes from other titans. The battle scenes are epic with stunning visual effects. The storyline concerning humans is also nicely presented, but it becomes pale to those who have come only to watch monsters' fight.Coming to the 3D, it is fast and sometimes, gives a headache as lot of fast actions are there. I had watched in IMAX theatre, and I felt that the quality of 3D could have been better. However, the special effects are top-notch. The background music with visually stunning scenes begs you to watch this movie in the biggest screen possible.Some scenes like Godzilla running and jumping to ocean (almost like flying) feels unrealistic. The human suddenly developing a giant arm for Kong, Godzilla sleeping in the Colosseum without breaking it, to me it felt cheesy. But visually it was beautiful.If you have come to watch a movie to have an amazing time, without worrying much about logic, this movie will not disappoint you.",8
Great movie don't listen to the Haters,"I am not going to spoil this movie for you but I guarantee that you'll love it. They really captured both characters in full essence. The visual effects alone are quite stunning in this movie. We went to AMC Theaters in Morrow with the nice reclining seats. Comfort feel of being at home with all the grandeur of being at the movies something you just can't get at home. Dolby Sound is the way to go you not only get a better sound quality but you will get all the feels to boot. Our seats where actually rumbling and shaking, making you feel like you were there with the characters in the movie it was spectacular.",10
Action packed but strange.,"Although I'm not a massive Godzilla fan, my interests lie more on Kong's side. I mean ever since watching KING KONG 1933 my mind has been up its arse ever since, I just love it with a passion.The only thing that ruins this latest instalment is the boring human segments and the way the monsters are shown.They don't come across being 394 feet and 337 feet and more like human sized, does anybody get what I'm on about here.Maybe its the cartoony cgi or the fact the characters now have far too many human characteristics that might be the reason they don't feel like giant sized bastards and wouldnt stand out in the planet of the apes movies, well maybe Godzy would look odd but that irrelevant to what I am trying to say here.It's not a crap film but just just could of done with far less human interaction and better cgi.But hey I didn't make this film as well as no other reviewer here did so really we should just enjoy it for what it is and maybe not try to belittle others work and concentrate on the good things in life.",8
This Film is way better than Minus One,"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is a visually stunning, sensory extravaganza that presents action payoff after action payoff. The film is utterly breathless, especially in IMAX, and is a 1-hour-and-55-minute amusement park ride. The story is clearly made with MonsterVerse novices in mind, but those who are not familiar with the series may find it difficult to envision. Both titular alpha titans come with decades of built-in lore, and those who are first in line are superfans who have memorized every detail. The human characters experience shock and confusion from yet another ""electrical anomaly"" in a universe where seismic waves and electric currents have factored into Godzilla's appearances since time immemorial. This infantilizes the most passionate audience members and presents a missed opportunity for more imaginative writing. While going back to these basics keeps The New Empire aligned with the classic mythology, the characters should be recognizing these signals from the get-go. The story is a missed opportunity for more imaginative writing and may not appeal to those who are not familiar with the MonsterVerse series. The New Empire introduces the ""Godzilla above, Kong below"" dynamic, indicating a mutual understanding between the two monsters. Kong, the main monster, is portrayed as human and sensitive, showing signs of aging and vulnerability. His sense of mortality drives the plot for both monkeys and humans. Rebecca Hall's Dr. Ilene Andrews, who was the strong protagonist of Godzilla vs. Kong, becomes a mother-like figure softened by love for her adopted daughter Jia and an old college buddy. However, her opportunities to shine suffer under the heavy weight of the Titans, as Kong's emotions and those of the other apes he seeks out come across stronger than hers. This fragile peace between Kong and Godzilla is not long-lasting. The recent mocking of Godzilla vs Kong has led to a reluctance to watch the movie, as it has been criticized for its absurdity and the Warner Brothers cinematic universe's poor foundation. Gareth Edwards' 2014 Godzilla was a dull and serious reboot, while Michael Dougherty's 2018 sequel, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, was unwieldy and poorly executed. In between, Jordan Vogt-Roberts' 2017 Kong: Skull Island was more entertaining and surprisingly nasty, with a better understanding of the tone a b-movie should have. The films attempted to establish an interconnected world of city-crushing monsters controlled by Monarch, but the convoluted dot-connecting pushed us further away from the good stuff of watching giant creatures destroy things. The commercial failure of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, which barely covered its budget and marketing costs worldwide, made Warners question their extravagant MonsterVerse, especially after shooting Godzilla vs Kong before its predecessor's release. Godzilla vs Kong, a film directed by Adam Wingard, is set to release in the US on HBO Max and cinemas in the UK. The film, initially seen as a bloated and unwanted piece of boardroom product, has transformed into a scrappy contender, fighting its way from deep beneath sea level to the surface. The plot is a frantic way to justify why the two titans would come to blows, both of which were previously positioned as protectors of humanity. Their beef is down to a mysterious threat connected to Apex Industries, a company whose headquarters is attacked by a previously dormant Godzilla in the first act. His destructive reappearance leads to global concern that he may now be more foe than friend. Kong, living in a controlled tech simulation within Skull Island, is recruited to help by leading a group of humans on a deep dive to the core of the Earth. The details of the fight scenes are too silly to get into and also of lesser interest than the main question most readers will have: how are those fight scenes?While the misleadingly magnificent trailers for Godzilla: King of the Monsters teased a film of immersive action and sweeping, surreal beauty, the film itself offered confusing choreography, ugly editing, and an inability to turn a single stunning image into a sequence of note. Despite genre inexperience, director Wingard quickly grasps the mechanics of action far quicker and keeps us grounded while in the middle of chaos. The much-hyped battles deliver the giddy thrills we demand, but there's also a staggeringly well-built and extensive universe to explore. The journey to the core of the Earth is a film in itself, with visual touches borrowed from both Star Wars and Tron franchises.",9
Pretty good tho,"Human screen time is enough but we don't even need humans. This is a Kong movie, not a G x K movie because the movie gave Kong TOO MUCH SPOTLIGHT that Godzilla like a support character. Because of it, as a Godzilla fan, I have to accept that Godzilla screentime in this movie is too boring , beside with the G vs Kong . This isn't fair for him .Scar King is a little bad villian . It's too weak that it lose Kong . It also smaller than Kong tho . It uses too much power of Shimo that if there was no Shimo , It's just a loser . However , it still show it brutal to the monkeys by kill Suko mom or smth like thatRate : 9.1.",9
So bad I love it,"This movie is just like every other monster verse movie, junk food and trash writing, and that's why I love it. The point of the monster verse movies isn't to tell a compelling story about the magic of friendship or anything like that, the point is to through a mediocre cgi'ed gorilla and lizard kick ass.This movies writing is bad and so are the characters, that's also what makes these movies great. Even though the writing is bad, I love it and laugh at it. My mates and I could honestly not stop laughing during the movie, as it points out the stupid cliches and movie quote tropes that it has.Plot- 6/10
Characters- 3/10
Writing- 1/10
Stupidness- 10/10
unintended comedy- 9/10
Total- 8.",8
It's not minus one... and that's okay,"This film's purpose is to be entertaining, not to make the viewer shed a tear or contemplate the character's lore for weeks after watching. It's a big, dumb, monster mash and that's good. This is easily my favorite monsterverse project they've ever made because they just went all out. Skar king was a pleasant surprise as I didn't expect him to be so menacing and ruthless, and the design of Godzilla is one of my favorites ever.The main things that take it down a few notches for me though were the human characters - they were kind of annoying at times but they weren't in it too much. The best in a MV movie since 2014 - and how the sense of scale was lost in most scenes. Not many of the shots make the monsters look big, or imposing, and sometimes I couldn't tell what was happening due to it being so zoomed in. Last negative is that shimo wasn't very scary. I love her design, and it was very cool to see, but she didn't seem like that big a threat compared to ghidorah or even mechagodzilla.Best part of the movie? The supplex, hands down. Final fight was cool as well.Overall, it is a Kong movie with Godzilla as the op sidekick who does his own badass side quest. Super fun, and I think if you just let yourself have fun, you'll love it. My inner child was giggling the whole time.",8
It's so much better and even more exciting with the pink Godzilla.,"I think this Godzilla movie is where the script has improved a lot since the 2014 movie. The movie's script was on the bad side, but after Godzilla vs. Kong and this one, the script has improved a lot and got what we wanted the most, which is We wanted to go see a fun movie about monsters fighting each other, which was very fun to do, fulfilling all our needs. And the excitement of the monsters fighting in the light and seeing their full form was thanks to the production team. The cgi that was made came out quite realistic. But I want the storytelling in the movie to be better because this is too stuffed.",8
So much fun. A true blockbuster of action.,"Godzilla x Kong: The New EmpireThe fifth installment of the fun MonsterVerse, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, is a fun, action packed adventure of the usual monster vs monster craziness. Before I get started here, please turn your brains off and be ready for lots of color, noise and zappity zap zap.The film is a direct sequel to Godzilla vs Kong from 2021. With the Hollow Earth theory finally being proven, Kong has been bouncing around in there, still trying to find more of his kind. This has been going on since the Skull Island movie. The Iwi tribe is still decimated, with the one little girl still featured in the movie. I love that Dan Stevens is in the new movie being quite slapstick and it's great to see the Beast from the live action Beauty and the Beast film, and Matthew from Downton Abbey, being Trapper.Godzilla is doing his usual thing as well, but all of a sudden a new signal is detected. It causes him to go absorb a bunch of energy. Meanwhile Kong discovers cracks in his new world, and he finds more of his kind, but they aren't quite as ""friendly"".I'll stop there without spoiling, but one can guess that there is mayhem. One thing I will say is that the leader of the remaining Kong-like creatures is totally underwhelming. I was expecting much more from a fearsome creature, but he's so not scary. He only has control of an actual fearsome creature.Back to the aforementioned mayhem, it's actually fun. I mean it. I had a great time watching all the setup, the fights, and more fights, and the resolution of said fights. It was just... FUN. There are no deep, moving scenes, not much character development, so my usual essay on a movie won't be very exciting, But just under two hours of fun deserves smiles and satisfaction.It's a monster movie. It's fun (yes I've said that). I recommend it for those who have seen the other four movies, and I recommend it for those that haven't. Have fun, folks. I did.",8
People Just Don't Get It,"Look, I never post reviews. I am a simple guy who just goes likes to watch movies. However, I feel like I need to say something about this one. We all know how films are now a days. Critics hate everything that comes out unless it tells to most captivating story that Shakespeare himself couldn't have written and audiences generally like things the critics don't like. Most of my friends and I agree that a movie now is more than likely good when the general critic score is low. Which brings me to this film.This is a movie about a colossal radioactive lizard that can breathe atomic radiation teaming up with a giant axe wielding gorilla to fight a lengthy orangutan that yields a giant whip spine and controls a massive ice dragon that have been living in a hollowed out sub terrain of earth.How can anyone in their right mind go into this expecting it to be the next Gone With the Wind or Casablanca?! This is a movie you watch just to have giant monsters throw hands and have a good time. And that's exactly what this film does!I will admit, I am a kaiju movie fan. I own every Godzilla and Kong film on DVD (yes even the anime). And for the record, I would not even place it in my top 10 Godzilla films. But bias aside, this film did exactly what it claimed it would do. In this film, Godzilla and Kong team up to fight a newly discovered clan of Kongs. That is quite literally the title and is exactly what happened. Now is it a flawless film? Not even remotely close. But the point I want to make is that it did exactly what it set out to do. It was never meant to be groundbreaking or invent a new style of cinema. That is my biggest reason for leaving this review. Not every movie has to be the next cinematic masterpiece and both critics and people alike need to understand that. Not every film needs to be the best movie ever. Not every film has to be made for everyone to enjoy. Not every film needs to appeal to everyone. If every film is perfect, how can you tell which ones truly shine?Anyways, that's my review/rant. If you like watching giant monsters fight, watch this movie. If not, don't go see it. And if you don't like those movies but choose to watch it, don't leave a review. Imagine hating the taste of fish, going to a sushi place, eating their sushi, and leaving a bad review saying the fish was bad. Sounds dumb because it is.",9
Action packed and entertaining,"The plot of the movie is pretty stright forward,yet quite meaningful . The movie has emotions,action, comedy and everything and watching it in 4d makes much more sense as you can feel the every punch and action. Loved the fight sequences but Godzilla was shown for very less time however kongs ark was completed. Next time more of Godzilla please.Loved the sequence were Godzilla and kong run side by side ...my favourite of all.Humen character were important and Jias ark also got completed and Mathras also.New dentist doctor and old characters were also fun but. I am glad this time the focus was more on monsters .Cant wait for the next movie.",10
the Hollow Earth design is beautiful and the monster fights are impactful.,Sometimes you just need to turn your brain off and just go and enjoy some ridiculousness.The film got pretty bad reviews from critics because of the wacky cheesy human storyline. I was sort of feeling similar but it grew on me because the science fiction elements of this film are really kind of profound. Most of it takes place in the center of the Earth that is actually hollow and is teaming with monsters and there's all kinds of creative creatures and also native humans that live in this realm; Hollow EarthBasically centers around four characters the travel where they find King Kong living in this underworld and they summoned Godzilla to come down to the subterranean level to fight an evil creature I want to take over the world ! I mean I've been following king con for many years starting with the first film of 1933 when was the first king Kong released.I've always liked Japanese kaiju films. Anyway there's lots of kind of eye rolling cheesy human comedic dialogue which is a little bit out of place but the film really brought it's A game with science fiction and intense monster Mayham and actually the characters and comic relief kind of grew on me ! Bottom line 'Godzilla x Kong the New Empire' is a great science fiction creature feature ! The Hollow Earth design is beautiful and the monster fights are impactful. 7.5/10.,8
Laughing All The Way,"I came out of the cinema having viewed Gorilla x Kong: The New Empire, with my jaw aching having laughed so much at the sheer insanity that had assaulted my eyeballs for the past 2 hours.On the way home my wife and I were discussing how much fun the brainstorm sessions for that movie must have been (and how many illicit substances had to have been consumed)From frame 1 the movie is nuts but everyone involved plays it with such sincerity it still lands. Mark Hamill once said that no matter how ridiculous the dialogue you have to perform it like you believe it, and the cast here definitely live that ethos.And by the time Godzilla, Kong and a plethora of god knows whats embark on a massive ruckus in zero gravity, you will believe a giant monkey can fly.Such dumb fun.",8
Kong and Zilla!!,"I have been patiently waiting for this film for a while and it certainly lived up to my expectations. The human and monster roles combined well together, and the progression of the story worked almost perfectly. Godzilla's evolved form was amazing. The journey through the hollow earth was an incredible experience. Scar King and Shimo were both awesome antagonists and how she was freed from Skar King and killed him was a perfect ending. I loved the advanced technology used in many things in the movie. Kong and his interactions with the other primates worked perfectly including his meeting the baby Kong. I'd overall say it was a slight improvement over GvK. I look forward to where the monsterverse goes next, especially exploring more of the hollow earth or discovering new titans. It would have been great if the film was maybe 20 minutes longer or contained more classic characters from the franchise.",9
BOOYAH,Monkeys are awesome lizards are cool but when you make them big and put them in one movie? Golly gee you got me hooked. Big butterfly was dope indeed. The monkeys were very reminiscent of a dream I had once. I was in a jungle and I had many animal friends. One was much like the large villain of this movie but he was a king. Wait the villain was a king too. Nvm on that last part. There was also a big snake that hypnotized me. Like the song by Biggie. There was also a bear in my dream. He was pretty cool. I think my dream was just the jungle book. Yk what this movie is like the jungle book with Godzilla. That's pretty cool.,9
A fan action pack movie,"I seen this movie twice already I enjoy it the only parts it's letting me down is Shimo acting like an over sized dog with no character like Godzilla and Kong has. Not get me wrong I love the monstersver as a whole. It's a great movie. If I watch a monstersver movie it's possible a mix of Godzilla king of the monsters and Godzilla vs Kong fan, a little serious and world building. I prefer. The Monsterver over the MCU right now on fun and interesting movies long side, my other favorite franchise. Overall I enjoyed the Toho and legendary Godzilla movie but it's also fun watching two different characters of the same monster and Kong he had character growth from kong skull island to GXK.",9
Mass of Godzilla & Kong,"Very great effort by the whole movie team.. I don't know why these movies are not getting more credits than some other movies like Marvels,etc.. This movie team is doing whatever best to the screen eventhough they are not recognised better.. So sad to see it..Very neat Presentation...linked with Ancient world.. varios new things introduced in this movie.. very nice experience to see this in 3D Theater...given importance to Godzilla and Kong.. Shows the real power of Godzilla and Kong.. This movie keeps us eager to see the next scenes.. Everything well explained... Better than Godzilla vs Kong Movie..We like it very much... Our Children Likes it on a top of other movies..Thank u Movie Team..",9
Better than expected,"For a long time, my favorite monsterverse movie was the first one from 2014, KOTM was good but I never liked how overdramatic it was, Godzilla vs Kong (2021) on the other hand was GREAT with some interesting dynamics, and I loved Jia. Now before Godzilla x Kong New Empire was released I wasn't as excited as in old times for a new monsterverse film but I thought it had potential. I decided to watch it in cinema along with an amigo (friend) of mine, we saw it yesterday and we both liked it. It was a blast.First off, people say that the human characters in the monsterverse are bland, but for me personally, in this film (the main ones) were actually good. Three of the cast from Godzilla vs Kong (2021) are back in this film, like Bernie (the comic relief of the film) and I enjoyed them. I liked how they helped Kong in the last 3rd.Kong himself in this film was like Kratos from God of War. He was also along with that little Kong and it reminded me like the God of War Norse saga with Kratos and his son Atreus and it was great to see. Godzilla in the film was kinda hardly in the film because he was busy in protecting the surface world, while most of the film was in Hollow Earth where Kong was.In the film, the characters in Hollow Earth also manage to find Jia's original family and race. Now I think that Jia is the best human character of the monsterverse because of how much she cares about Kong and that she can communicate with him sign language.And man, Mothra's return was quite a surprise and joy to watch. After 5 years, Mothra is back and better than ever. I love the scene where Jia meets Mothra in front of the others, and I love how Jia and Mothra work together to help Godzilla and Kong to defeat the evil Kong. The scene where Godzilla and Kong are meeting Mothra with Jia putted a big smile on my face.The last third is now my favorite last third of any monsterverse film. And the ending was good. If I consider this to be the last monsterverse film then it's really not bad for a conclusion.My favorite monsterverse film.And, Mothra is best kaiju AND the best waifu.",9
They Did the Monster Mash,"Godzilla X Kong : The New Empire may sound like erotic fan fiction written by a Kaiju obsessive but its actually the 5th instalment in a decade spanning (how time flies) franchise. 2014's Godzilla finally brought the legendary lizard to Hollywood in a way that wasn't a complete embarrassment but struggled to marry the disparate parts of family drama and giant monster smackdown. Skull Island was a fun mystery island adventure. King of the Monsters went for epic, end of the world monster stakes and Godzilla vs Kong leaned into the silliness of it all. This film takes the ridiculousness of its predecessor and runs with it. And runs and runs.The plot, such as it is, involves a villainous giant ape named The Skar King imprisoned in the Hollow Earth attempting to conquer the surface world. Don't worry if that sounds like a bit of an underwhelming opponent for Big G, the nefarious simian has an ace up his sleeve. There are plenty of other big monsters for our titular duo to throw hands with and an undiscovered civilisation for the human characters to interact with. In terms of story its up there with the most batshit of the Toho movies but where those films just let the audience accept the wacky, Godzilla X Kong spends a little too long trying to justify itself.More than any other of the Monsterverse entries the titular monsters really are the main characters of the film, or more specifically King Kong is. While the pair are both basically superheroes here, Godzilla is the powerful wildcard to Kong's leading man. Its the natural decision given the ease with which human characteristics can be applied to a big ape and director Adam Wingard leans hard on this angle. Whether he's wincing with tooth ache or swaggering through the jungle with his chest puffed out like a multi-storey chad, Kong is, for all intents and purposes, a giant, really strong human being. Likewise, Skar King smirks and laughs his way through his screen time and scenes with him, Kong and any other apes play out like wordless human interactions.With the giants able to convey the movie's emotions it doesn't leave the human cast with much to do beside take on the role of comedy relief. The always likeable Brian Tyree Henry returns as monster podcaster Bernie and he is joined by Dan Stevens, proving once again he is one of Hollywoods most underrated stars as he brings the most laughs playing a zany adventurer/kaiju vet. There's also a fun turn from Alex Ferns, most known in the UK for his role as abusive Eastenders husband Trevor some twenty odd years ago. The ""serious"" acting is left to Rebecca Hall, returning as Kong expert Dr Ilene Andrews. This means that while everyone else is horsing around she's stuck delivering exposition and making sure we know she really cares about her adopted daughter. Hall is up to the task and sells it all gamely but there's no escaping the fact it feels like she is in a completely different film.Realistically, any time a person is on screen they're just filling time until the next monster fight. The beast on beast violence comes thick and fast and while a couple of the encounters are disappointingly short or happen mainly off screen, the ones that deliver really deliver. The sense of scale the earlier movies had is diminished by the hallow earth setting and light on their feet monsters but in its place is some insanely innovative superhero fighting. The final 4-way showdown begins in hollow earth zero gravity before exploding onto the surface world as the massive combatants unleash fists, teeth, whips, axes, power gloves and deadly breath rays on each other in a crowd pleasing smackdown that pays homage to the classics while taking the spectacle to a whole other level.Godzilla X Kong plays to the bleachers with more or less every scene designed to either make you laugh or marvel at the action and while it isn't high art, it is, in its own way very innovative. Keep them coming please.8 rotten titan canines removed out of 10.",8
Awesome experience,"I loved the way that the fights had been focused on.Very good fights and I'm waiting for the next battles.Everyone at cinema was vibrating with the battles, and enjoying the scenes.The last movies was focused much on human history instead monsters. They improved a lot this time.Next movies I really hope that the production of the movie continues focusing on the monster battles.That's what we are going to the cinema, see big monsters fighting with much blood and huge screams.Please do not follow the especialized criticism, they don't know anything about fighting big monsters hahahah.",10
the best movie of the saga,"""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is finally the movie everyone was waiting to see. After the disappointment I felt in ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" I got my eyes back with healthy and hard fights. Finally they understood that in these films the majority of the duration must be occupied by the titans, that is THE PROTAGONISTS. They finally figured it out, even if there are some nice mistakes. As in the entire Monsterverse saga the special effects are great but in this movie I noticed a huge improvement. The photography, the setting and the direction are beautiful, as well as the many emotions present. The action level is incredible and exciting, with every punch being dropped by the characters my smile was printed on my face. The new titans in there are beautiful, and they really got me going. Also finally after the (in my opinion) failure of the film that inaugurated this Monsterverse, ""Godzilla"", here you see the true power of the titan with all its explosiveness. Now to the mistakes: the plot initially seemed as simple as I wanted and good entertainment, but then as always they went to ruin with the inclusion of mythology at random, horrible, senseless and poorly explained. Also another thing that I didn't like are the actors, sometimes the situation had become a bit embarrassing, excluding Brian Tyree Henry who always makes so much smile. One thing that I liked is the comedy, many scenes have led me to smile so much. If they have to go on (as I think they do) with the saga, I hope they will do it with this level or maybe improving. So far, ""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" is for me the best movie in the saga..
Rating: 8.1/10.",8
Godzilla x Kong the best monster movie,"This movie contains tons and tons and tons of action. The CGI in the movie is incredible for an only 135 million budget. The comedy in this movie is really good. Even if it's sometimes hard to make you laugh at a movie this one might get you in one scene Kong find a baby monkey, but the baby monkey attacks him and so do some other giant apes but Kong grabs the monkey by his legs and hits the other apes with the baby monkey, and throws him around, which in my opinion is really, really funny. The movie doesn't quite earn the 10 out of 10, but it definitely is my favorite movie of the year. Great movie.",9
An Entertaining Action Movie!,"Very Minor SpoilersThis is a really fun action spectacle film to watch with friends and family. The CGI for Godzilla and Kong looks beautiful. Scar King and the Frost Lizard have really colorful and interesting designs.The human story seems to get better with every new Monsterverse movie, and this is no exception. The relationship between Jia and Dr. Andrews is compelling. Brian Tyree Henry and Dan Stevens are hilarious and provide some great comic relief.The music is nice to listen to, even if it doesn't always fit the scene.Its biggest weakness is that it doesn't do anything particularly new, just puts tropes into a different context. The movie is very entertaining.",8
What cinema is supposed to be.,"Wow. I.. WOW. This movie was great, it was a blast and I was extremely hyped during the entire movie. The humans were.. ehh. Very mediocre acting, but I found Trapper quite hilarious and entertaining, even if he was a bit odd and had some... NPC-esque dialogue sometimes. Bernie is just.. okay. He had some great moments, especially when the pilot guy got eaten by a tree. A LITERAL TREE. It was hilarious, and genuinely made me flinch from how loud the sound effects were in that moment, as well as the random suddenness of it. Ilene, was a pretty alright character, her writing was alright. She had great moments too, I know, I just forgot. Now, Jia and the Iwi, was a pretty good arc of the movie, even though we didn't really need it, especially with how short the movie is. I know this would be weird, but I wished the movie was 3 hours long. It's long, yes, but it would flesh out the backstory and lord behind the titans, and more titan action too. Maybe have some better writing for the part where Kong gets his robotic fist. Project Powerhouse should have clearly been explained in the epilogue of the movie, heck, even the novelization, but no. So, overall the human part and overall writing was okay and all over the place, which is expected, it's not Minus One. It's supposed to be based off the Showa Era of Toho's Gojira, but this is NOT at all close to the insanity of the Showa era, but still extremely fun. I was at the edge of my seat and was screaming ""DAMN!"" every titan action scene. Great visuals, mid writing, and extremely good action. I recommend this movie A LOT for people who enjoy random lore and action being thrown all around the place (in a proper way though).And Godzilla was extremely brutal here.. My guy legit obliterated Scylla, and used her own leg to stab her in the face while he performs the Kiss of Death. Also to Tiamat, damn.. That was like.. 15 seconds of screen time for her? Crazy. It did make sense, read the comic ""Godzilla: Dominion"" for it to make more sense, and also, her home was the most powerful source of natural radiation at the time, plus Tiamat is a Destroyer-class, even more sense. Godzilla was throwing hands, damn. I also loved how he just wakes up, beats the crap out of everyone, and goes back to sleep at the end. Amazing. About his design, it is amazing. I love Millenium Goji's design, which is probably pretty controversial, but yes, I do. And seeing the pink dorsal plates and breath... it was so good, and a lot more visually interesting than regular old blue, which I still like. I do wish the fight in Rio was set in nighttime, for a great lightshow. He also had very little screen time, which I think is fine because all his appearances were amazing. And also, the fact he turns into Thermozilla (but by his own, and way weaker), and just spams Atomic Breath all over Skar King was great. And Wingard, I'M WAITING FOR THE GODZILLA X KONG SEQUEL WITH G-MAN AS THE MC AND NOT KONG!Now, about Kong. He was such a good main character, had great development and everything, his relationship with Suko was exactly like Kratos and Atreus.. All his fights were great, and a lot of the things I had to say for Goji applies to Kong as well, he was great with a great design. His only flaw is the Infinity Gauntlet thing, which was out of place, but cool, I still like it. And the way he just punched the yapping monkey straight in the damn face was hilarious, had me spitting out my drink everytime I saw it on YT, and of course in the theaters. For the other characters, however..Skar King. What a great, and short-lived villain. He was amazing, menacing, and I think was the only MV villain with personality. His list of crimes is absolutely insane, and I get why he has a whiplash. Of course he does, he's a slave master with a different fur color from the rest of the great apes. God, he is amazing.His design was badass, he was slim and had a huge wingspan, (arms) and his blue eyes were menacing. The way he laughed at Kong's silver tooth and then got karma at the end was hilarious. I wish the movie was longer, JUST FOR THIS GUY!! I love him, and his design. Absolute top-tier MV villain so far. And the way he was so scared and leaping around Rio, while Goji spammed his ass was damn hilarious. Also, this guy legit has a whole army of Baby Kongs just like Suko, which explains the one ape holding their baby titan, which was orange. Just like Suko and Skar.About Shimo. She looks amazing, you could tell the pain and agony from her roars and resisting as she was chained up by Skar King and mind- controlled. It's crazy how tall she is, and how huge and long her body is. Wish we got more of her, and the end with Kong riding her and petting her under her chin and comforting her, she was just waiting to be freed from Skar King and Kong helped her with that. But.. Godzilla literally just went back to sleep.Great movie.10/10, only some minor flaws but I just wanted to see dumb fun.As an ACTUAL MV fan who doesn't just base every Godzilla movie off Minus One's greatness, and ranks them low I feel pretty offended by people who don't know ANYTHING about Godzilla on YT, and those critics. Don't listen to them, if you like a dark and gritty movie, go for G-14 and G-1. If you like dumb fun and action, watch G:KOTM, GvK, GxK, Kong: SI, and the Showa Era.Goodnight, or morning, or afternoon. Thanks! (This is my first movie review)",10
A Lot of Fun,"If you are looking for intellectual stimulation then you are looking at the wrong movie. However if you want get special effect, excellent CGI and something that is entertaining and fun then this is the movie for you. Continuing the reboot where Godzilla and Kong are cast as Titans from an ancient past they end up eventually teaming up to beat an old foe. It certainly is a big screen movie as that is the best way to appreciate the special effects. While it could work as a stand alone movie it would be better to have seen the previous movie 'Godzilla Versus Kong' so that much of the context of the movie makes more sense. Overall though it was a lot of fun.",8
A whole universe,"I really liked this movie, a continuation of the one made during the pandemic, and much more than the first, it entertained me, it went by quickly, it has very good animation and special effects, it makes me want to go see Hollow Earth. In this film in its opening scenes we see Kong sad for being alone, with a terrible tooth pain, on the other hand Godzilla who protects the planet from multiple catastrophes, his favorite place to sleep being the Roman coliseum, and on the other hand we see to Ilene trying to help Jia have a normal life, however Jia feels like she is not part of this world. On Earth, a help signal begins to be detected from some undiscovered site in Hollow Earth, which is also detected by Godzilla (who tries to reach it and destroys the world a little in its path), there we discover 2 new worlds that will change the lives of Kong and Jia, and the other humans, these worlds open the way to an entire multiverse (called monsterverse). Kong really will always be my favorite of the 2, as I feel like he has a more sensitive side and that it's not all destruction but also helping, in the end we see that he found a new, non-lonely home. Just as Jia manages to discover her life goal, however always at Ilene's side (this character is a true inclusion). They will almost certainly make a sequel, since it has a very good box office. What strikes me most about these films is how with so few dialogues they can say so much, which shows us that language is not just verbal, it is something more universal. The world of the Iwi is fascinating, I hope they manage to expand it further.",9
Roarrrrrr,"Boy,Boy This Movie Is Amazing
Not Surprising About The Box Office Success I Mean Gahdamn It Deserves Every Cent Of It.And Good News Too, Legendary CEO Just Confirmed That The Future Of The Monster Verse Is Looking Good.Meaning More Monster Verse Movies Are Up For GrabsBlue, pink,red Whatever Just Keep 'em Coming(Godzilla)

Just The Way I Like It.Counted Every Minute Until It's Release And I Wasn't Disappointed
I Can Proudly Suggest This Movie To Whoever
Best Movie Of The 2020's Ever.",10
Expectation,"Hopefully any that appear in the future will have their different entrance soundtracks.I really like the aboriginal Japanese music when Godzilla appears.The soundtrack for King Kong's appearance should be matched with the music of the indigenous people of South America.It is also hoped that future films will feature more of the ancient Titans featured in the earlier films.And I hope to learn more about the grudges and grudges that existed among the Titans hundreds of millions of years ago.I also hope that the plots of future movies will explore more issues of environmental protection, natural changes, and human beings in the natural world.",8
Best of the Monsterverse yet.,"Woooo. This one is a doozie. So, I love this movie. But that's pretty much granted since I'm already a monster fan. However, I think this movie does way more than just good enough, and I'd wager that most people would be able to enjoy it pretty fine. I think there's really only 3 significant points of criticism, which do hurt the movie but I don't think any of them ruin it.These are:
1-Human drama is, once again, lackluster in most parts, which could be a stark contrast against Godzilla Minus One (which, though I haven't gotten the opportunity to watch it yet, I hear has some pretty good drama). But I'd say it's still better in this area than Godzilla vs Kong, which isn't a high bar, but it's the closest film to this one, so it's still an improvement. Jia and Andrews' relationship is the least awful and at moments it's even good. I find Trapper to be charismatic enough.2-The character of Bernie Hayes particularly draws the human scenes down, and so does all the jargon and nonsense sci-fi (or more accurately sci-fantasy) talk that comes with him. Strangely, I only found this ridiculous sci-fantasy aspect of the film disturbing only when he tried to explain it. I guess that's kinda what they were going for? But it was still not great. In other areas, when this movie does something ridiculous, it always leads to something so awesome that you're perfectly willing to get on board with it.3-There's a little bit too much screaming. Yeah, I'm a Godzilla fan and a monster fan and I still think so. I usually even love the roaring in these movies, but there really is so much roaring that it ends up becoming somewhat desensitizing.Besides these points, the film does pretty much perfectly everything that you could expect it to do. So why do some people continue to keep looking down on it? I have no idea. But I think their expectations are just not appropriate. We already had Godzilla vs Kong and right down from the title to all the trailers It was pretty obvious that this one would be more of the same. In fact, I'm not sure if it could possibly be more obvious what this movie's appeal is. Then, why do critics come into this movie expecting... A clever plotline? And more outrageously, maybe even political and social commentary as ""true godzilla"" films have done? Yeah, I'm aware that just because a movie has lots of monster action and spectacle that does not mean the movie can't play for people who are... more concerned with intellectual aspects. But it still stands that this movie was not going to even aim to have that. Why expect it? Why hold it to that standard? I have no idea. I just know that if the next Monsterverse movie is once again made by Adam Wingard and is advertised similarly to this film, you won't like it if you have expectations of a film like Interstellar or The Martian or even Shin Godzilla. So please. Just don't see it? Unless you just enjoy seeing movies you think are bad...?",
Blockbuster entertainment,"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire brings an epic clash of titans to the screen, boasting jaw-dropping visuals and adrenaline-pumping battles. The film's intense action, paired with impressive special effects, creates a cinematic experience that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats. While the storyline may lean towards predictability, the sheer spectacle of witnessing these iconic monsters go head-to-head is undeniable. It's a must-watch for fans of the franchise and those seeking blockbuster entertainment. Whether you're rooting for Godzilla or Kong, this film delivers an exhilarating ride that will satisfy your craving for epic showdowns.",
An absolute Blast for your newborns,"This has to be one of the most inspid and zany film I've laid my eyes upon. This has got to be a effing joke right?Both the main characters are wasted and felt like underutilised.The human cast was mostly garbage especially Bernie. He was obnoxious in the previous movie and remains the same in this one. Instead Dan stevens could have been give more screen time.The CGi is very poor and rough in some scenes and it's glaringly obvious.The most repulsive thing about it is the monsters don't move or fight like monsters rather inflated balloons. No weight, no impact, no earthquake... Nothing.Also the fight scenes were extremely short and uninteresting. Why else would someone would want to watch a movie of big monsters if they don't fight for a considerable amount of time?Well I guess if you let a low budget garbage tier scholcky horror movie director handle your tentpole blockbuster franchise this outcome isn't all that surprising.But hey if I point out the flaws instead of gobbling down nonsense then I am public enemy number 1 right?",
BIG LONELY MONKE X ATOMIC LIZARD VS RED MONKE AND ICY LIZARD,"(NO MAJOR SPOILERS, JUST WHAT YOU SHOULD BE EXPECTING)This was epic. Nothing like what Christopher Nolan or some avatar stuff and i am all in for that! This movie scratched the most sensitive part of my brain in a great way. The CGI is done amazingly well and i never thought I'd see Kong smirk, but i did.Its good to watch an easy movie like this which is just action, action and action. The soundtrack is amazing as usual. The hollow Earth shots were amazing.I really want to appreciate the director's and the team's imaginations who created all the unique creatures which had their own looks and styles.Kong was the main focus and Godzilla felt more like a side character, but in my opinion Godzilla stole the show whenever he appeared.In the end, watch it loud, big and with a crowd. It's worth watching if you are into getting entertained by watching movies which are larger than life.",
Just no,"I have a lot of patience for movies like this, I love a mindless Kaiju flick... but this was messy hot garbage. I couldn't finish it and that was after an hour and a half. It is mind boggling to me that visually most of the film looked like a trailer for a PlayStation game circa 2008 with a budget of 135 million. Utter madness and inexcusable. Where did the money go? Not on the cast, not on the incredibly sloppy script. I like Dan Stevens but he's not that expensive, and wasn't at his best. If you really want to watch a mopey ginger ape derp around for two hours with useless background humans who never seem to understand the plot themselves, go for it I guess. Lame.",
"A good, fun and bloated movie","I'm honestly surprised this movie clocked in at only 1 hour and 55 minutes, it felt like 2.5 hours watching it. This movie suffers from the current trend of having every conversation take place in a new setting, the green screen paradox if you will. Everything was, you liked that, well here is twice that, mostly w/o explanation - One Hollow Earth, how about Hollow, Hollow Earth? Or let's spend a few minutes showing off this cool camouflage that we won't use, but it looks coolEach Kaiju battle needed to take place in a new city because? How many Pyramids are there, or were there?Scar King was super cool, but why were they mining(?) the earth. Again, it just looks sort of cool and gives you a chance to see Scar be Scar but, what were they doing? No explanation. That being said you understood the Shimou/Scarr relationship.Casting wise, Trapper was played by (not) Bradley Cooper and the Pilot was (not) Jack Black, Ilene tried to channel Kristen Wig, etc. Etc. Felt like Jumanji at timesIn the end, its a Godzilla Kong buddy movie, fishts were fun ans Scar was legit opponent.Next movie we'll discover Jia's twin sister or she'll be cloned?Worth a matinee ticket.",
Brilliant Monsterverse Movie With Insane and Unexpected Plot Twists.,"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire delivers an outstanding Kaiju Battle and An epic adventure to the hollow earth.For the first time, this is the monsterverse film that uses a plot twists.The story is all about two distinctive plot points, one for kong and one for godzilla. Kong focuses on the hollow earth while Godzilla taking advantage on the surface of the earth. Jia's vision gives a glimpse of a hidden threat within the hollow earth. Monarch Team of Dr. Irene and Kong along with Trapper (Dan Stevens) searches for it in the hollow earth.The adventure continues as they explore the hollow earth. They witness one of their outposts was destroyed by none other than Skar King which has a mark of a handprint. The glimpse of mothra in stone wall gives me goosebumps. Dr. Irene thought that Jia was the last of Iwi Tribe. The Iwi tribe gives them a background history about the kaiju war of Skar King and Shimo. I really like the fact that Godzilla is the one who imprisoned them.The movie has different fights and it was all epic with gorgeous VFX. Godzilla Fights Scylla and Tiamat. Kong Fights DrownViper and Other related apes. The Fight Scene of Skar King and Kong in the ape lair with lava was goosebumps. The Evolution and Power Radiation of Godzilla in this film is super awesome the way how he absorbs energy the more powerful he becomes.When the two level up to their power levels, Skar King and Shimo along with other ape army seeks for the blue portal that exists through the hollow earth. Godzilla Fights Kong Egypt, Mothra returns through rebirth and diffuses the fight. Then the trio go to the hollow earth portal and fight in a zero gravity.The Climax is full of kaiju mayhem and good ending. The Plot Twist of this film is Shimo who was controlled by Skar King is not a true villain she was just suffered by skar king's command and she got revenge by freezing the cruel kaiju.Overall it was worth to watch and it was so fun, perfect kaiju movie. 10/10.",
