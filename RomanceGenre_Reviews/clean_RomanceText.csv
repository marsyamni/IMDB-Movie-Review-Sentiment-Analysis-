"as a  year old black dude i actually liked this show i honestly thought it was going to be a full on comedy but it actually had a lot of dramatic themes i wont lie when i watched the first two episodes i was very very confused as to why there were alot of black royals i thought for a second that this was true but if memories served me right it wasnt but then i began to understand that this is all fiction and a madeup fantasy on what if life was like this
and i have to admit i kinda liked it some people dont like the film because of it being politically incorrect but there are hundreds and hundreds of period dramas that are more accurate than this so why dont those people just go and watch those i think people just want to complain about something because human beings are never satisfied even some of the greatest period dramas that are pretty historically accurate has its fair share of haters i didnt take it seriously i just turned my brain off and enjoyed the fantasy"
if youre going to be historically inaccurate in a period romance for the sake of politically correct diversity  fine you can be forgiven for thatif you want to argue that what youre writing is fiction so youre entitled to write whatever you want  fine its true you canbutif you do if you proceed to go where angels fear to tread then you had better make damn sure the fiction youre writing is amazingunfortunately this bridgerton adaptation by shondaland is anything but it has all the amazing of beige wall paper in a beige room with beige furniture you just get slapped in the face with all the disappointing beigeshondaland has completely rewritten the best parts of the duke and i and turned it into a generic shadow of its former glory all that remains of the original story are bare bonesjust focusing purely on the story  the shows writing is uninspiringly generic with tired old storylines introducedwhyif it aint broken why fix itthe original story is amazing it needed nothing no fixing and instead shondaland broke itpretty is all well and good on camera but its not enough to make a great show a great show needs more where is the humour where the sparkling dialogue where the personalitymuscles beauty and gratuitous sex do not chemistry create personality is sexy originality is sexy humour is sexy sexy things the book has in spades things this show has not been able to reproducebut the worst atrocity shondaland has committedthe characters they lack characterthey have been recreated as barely there shadows of what they are in the books almost all of themanthony unrecognisable his treatment of daphne his surly immature moodiness and his wanting to run off with an opera singer not anthony anthony always put his family first in the books because he thinks hes going to die young like his father did he would never have forced his sister to marry anyone anthony was charming confident and kinddaphne in the books she was never a diamond of the first water daphne had been out three seasons already she was a very likeable down to earth easy to get along with dark haired girl  not a clueless insipid vain blonde her friends were the wallflowers all the gentlemen felt comfortable with hersimon in the show simon is a bland generic hero all muscles no brain no real conversation no humour simons famous stutter makes no appearance whatsoever except as a child simon in the books is reserved but passionate super smart longing for family he is thoughtful in my opinion this actor had no emotional range he was wooden he actually made me yawnsimon and daphne together in the show are also uninspired lacking real chemistry in the books they sparked they were funny they made you love them as a couplecolin in the books colin has a way of seeing into people he is probably the sharpest and most insightful of all the bridgertons colin in the show is a clueless puppy and his hair is terribleviolet where was violets sparkle her moxie in the books she is admired and adored by all her children violet has a sly sense of humour especially when it comes to match making she outwitted her children she knew what she was about she is a respected leader in society she made things happen violet is not the worried lipbiting unsure mother the show has given uslady danbury in the books lady d is sassy opinionated and scathing she says things to throw people off balance shes feared in general shes a menace with her cane the shows lady d is too refined too tactful too nice lady d did not openly play match maker with violetlady whistledown she is witty  never truly mean or cruel which turns out to be penelopes saving grace in the end we loved reading lady whistledowns humorous observations in the book the ton eventually see it as a right of passage in society to be mentioned by her but in the show they paint her petty cruel and hatedbridgerton family the family in the books is loud boisterous irreverent loving and fun they joke tease talk play and are fiercely loyal to each other they are all friends which makes them differ from the usual ton families in the show that family makes very little appearance the family of the show is for at least  out of the  episodes shallow vain fraught disjointed uncommunicative distant and to be honest a bit annoying this is not the bridgerton family of the booksin short many of the read the books once a year for years fans will like me be very disappointed with this series some adaptation is always expected  but an almost complete rewritemake no mistake about it shondaland has rewritten dismantled or removed the majority of the best parts of the duke and i for this showlets hope they do better with season two
this is not a quality jennifer ehlecolin firth pride and prejudice type series or downton abbey this show is an exaggeration of those kinds of tales and it is pure fantasy using the back drop of victorian english high society do not take it seriously and enjoy it for what it is it really highlights the absurdity of that time period as well i love the pride and prejudice series i mentioned above and to me this movie was like a guilty pleasure version of that kind of genre costumes are beautiful and they threw in some modern music played classically so really this show is not taking itself seriously as a period piece and is clearly just having fun have fun with it and enjoy the eye candy
let me just start that i am a fan of the books so i am watching this as i did when i watched all the live actions of pride and prejudice with eyes finally getting my wish of seeing my fave books come to life and i was not disappointed is it a masterpiece not at all is it accurate to the books not so much but they did get the heart of it theres a lot of issue i find with it but somehow i still find myself watching it because i love the genreto note if you are into the accurate retelling of history then im telling you right now skip this this isnt about the accurate retelling of history so if the diversity and wokeness the designs of their costumes the way they acted takes you away from the story because of inaccuracy then you will have a bad time this isnt a documentary this isnt a biography this isnt a true storynow first of the books star different siblings so each season will focus on different bridgerton with splice inserts of side stories s is more steamy and shoves a more lustful play on their romance its a fake love turned real love trope s is a slow burn and might be boring for some as it is less steamy its an enemies to lovers tropenow if youre into the book series do give this a try of course it wouldnt be  accurate but i did feel that it was very true in how romance book genre goes its like a whimsical romance glazed over or whatever term something like those hallmark christmas romance movies but with more mature scenes modern music made classical they really brought to life the family dynamic of the bridgertons i love how they interact with one another as a familyfinally if youre just looking for a pride and prejudice or historical setting romance show then do give this a try you might just like it
i read a lot of negative reviews especially about the characters that do not correspond to the era to be honest i think you shouldnt be too heavy on that its fiction and it just looks good it is a shame that the first episode is the least fun this would almost make you stop watching fortunately i looked further which i certainly do not regret it seems nice and i am looking forward to season 
claudia jessie played eloise with extreme class hope she continues to stun the stage in her future acting career
wondering how the overall rating was  when all the reviews i see are below  waisted an hour watching this awful drivel enough said
i am well aware of quinns bridgerton series but people are not focusing enough on things such as directing plot acting etc who cares if there werent black aristocrats this point keeps dragging and its honestly quite pointless quinn herself expected a very inclusive cast and a reinterpretation of the series stop wasting your energy in worrying about pc culture have some imaginationnow the plot is predictable for a novel series like this i chose to watch it with my mother and it was enjoyable like an afternoon conversation with friends nothing deep really lack of subtlety but that doesnt have to be a bad thing people often forget who are watching series and films forgetting that some may not understand the undertones of a message bridgertons lack of subtlety is beneficial for them for my mother who doesnt understand english aristocracy because of our background she loved the seriesit is a very colorful setting wonderful clothes and scenery there is a lot of individuality represented through that some characters certainly felt reinterpreted from the original material for example i hadnt imagined anyone with particularly loud personalities mainly in presentation the series provides this admittedly daphne was an absolute bore many times i was not passionate about thompson so basically some characters were louder some were more tame when compared to the original at times i welcomed the change but not every timeanyway i look forward to the progress of this series i also look forward to people relaxing a bit and trying to understand that media enjoyment is different for others literature majors may scurry away from the predictable and superficial but for example someone whose main language isnt english and has always lived in a lowmiddle class neighborhood may feel welcomed into a different culture and may start a learning opportunity its not about absolute accuracy its about captivating our attention at first sometimesoh and also i dont think the subtitles in spanish are the best there are words that change tone when translated i listened as i read the subtitles i had to retranslate a few times so my mother
usually i find myself disappointed by second seasons of shows especially when the first is so good and as such did not have the highest of hopes heading into season  having recently completed it i can confidently say that its better than season one what about it made it better i cannot say though i am a sucker for forbidden romance and the removal of those awful sideburns made anthony x hotter the second season is a must watch with a thrilling slow burn and an incising story i cannot wait to see how this show plays out and stand witness to each bridgerton siblings season and the pages of gossip it will bring
here are my thoughts i have to note that i had reservations about this when i first saw the casting of simon and other poc actors as a black women i didnt know if it was pandering to my ethnic group or if it was for genuine inclusivity and after seeing simon on screen i must say that he is perfect i literally cant picture him otherwise and ive been picturing him for over a decade i also have to say the same for lady d i was surprisingly pleased with the marina character btw shes not new to the series just early she will fit in like a puzzle im enjoying how flushed out anthony is i admit he was a little d for the first book since he wasnt a main character so i appreciate that tv allows him more dimension and build up the rest of the siblings are excellent too the seeds of their characters are coming through the visuals directing and music reminds me of a true historical romance book this doesnt feel like a made for tv show i love how they managed to make the colors so beautiful and vibrant unlike other historical romance moviesshows that have everything accurately bleakthis series was my very first introduction to the romance genre of books when i was a little girl and i could not have asked for a better pilot episode the characters the chemistry the intrigue the intensity this list goes on and on is exactly how i pictured it and how i felt when i first read this series years agoto all those that worked on this series  everyone from the actors to the crew your artistic talent has not just made beautiful period piece show no your artistic talent has magically translated all the beautiful things i love about historical romance books and the writing of arguably the most famous hr author of modern times perfectly to the screen and to that i thank you from the bottom of my heart
warning spoilersi love the show i do but this was a bit of a letdownthey led us in a direction they didnt follow through withi dont think i was the only one under the impression lord debling would be head over heeels for pen it was disappointing to not see her get that adoration i just dont understand the thinking thereour girls glowup deserved more this too was a letdown at least one lord should have been giving colin a run for his moneyi did not like at all whorey boy colinwe should have watched them innocently fumble through the blossom of young love colin is not a rake it was kind of grossi did enjoy the introduction of francesca and the sweet nature they gave her it will pay dividends in the future is they dont screw it up like the fake rakei thought the fetherington girls were hilarious these first  they had some great lines and mrs f never disappointsi was really hoping either she or mrs b would be given a true blue love interest that would tease to knock our socks off they are both amazing actresses there are so many possibilities thereone more thing why on earth was colin celebrated the hero when debling literally saved pens life shes not a worthy enough treasure to leave the ton swooning at her rescuesome of the little side stories they are building just took up what could have been more colin and pen timeit was sorely lacking we had no big build up like the last two coupleswe all know the importance of forplay before the big scene and they stole that from us thats what im most dissatisfied abouti will continue to watch of course like everyone else and hope for more meet and potatoes but im afraid it will be more along the lines of kippers and mash
"eloise and lady danbury are by far my favorites but i liked it all overall quite different than the book but keeping essential plots and the essence
i do love the diverse casting"
"knowing nothing about the books or what to expect from the show i gotta admit that the diversity threw me in the beginning by the second episode i became colorblind and grew completely enchanted by it all that i didnt want it to end
although i loved it to be quite frank in a way it made me sad all the diversity well it made me see how the world could have been and needs to be
i eagerly await the second season"
march  season  is better the acting is so much better and the storyline as well the actor who plays anthony jonathan bailey he deserves bigger onscreen roles is an outstanding actor skip season  only watch season  this season has the right balance of drama laughter character development and build up season  was too much sx season  is good and not too much sx season  is worth max a  because of the bad acting season  is worth a  the chemistry that anthony and kate had in season  was amazing 😍 i didnt feel that with daphne  simon something was off without the intimacy that was scriptedcoached they looked like friendsthe actor that plays anthony carries his role well hes through and through anthony bridgerton and a hunk he has no sideburns in season  so much better  jonathan bailey deserves to be on the big screens now such a diverse actor that can take on any role hes very good with his face at expressing emotioncant wait to see anthony  kate in the upcoming seasons helping the other bridgerton siblings they confirmed that they will staydecember  phoebe dynevor daphne deserves more recognition she carried season  and it was mostly shown through her gaze the female gaze no wonder most women are having the hots for simon page is such a bad actor who is overrated and who looks too feminine now hes leaving the show what an ungrateful actor  in the voice of lady whistledown rumour has it that page is closeted has a beard and is not speaking his truthon a positive note i loved the diversity in the show truly amazing how they not only chose white characters to be represented as the rich in society but a diversity of people with different skin colours just like it is nowadaysanyone who critiques this period piece needs to do some research this show was made by a producer that is renowned to cast a diverse cast this tv show is fiction and a new period piece on its own its a modern makeover of the regency period drama and therefore more relatable also stop bullying the fact that a variety of people with different skin colours are represented in the show those people lack imagination
the costumes settings music are all beautiful but weve seen them before this season lacks the substance and intrigue that led so many to bingewatch the first a gaping hole is left with the resolution of simon and daphnes romance the love triangle between anthony kate and edwina feels forced with none of the actors particularly charismatic the heightened focus on eloise is detrimental with the actress eyerolls overreaction and unrealistic conduct reminiscent of anna chlumsky as vivian in inventing anna the other subplots are so redundant that they could have been crafted from film left on the editing floor in season  and werent enthralling on the first goround eg penelopes unrequited infatuation with colinmy rating of  is the average of a  for season  and a  for season 
i first read the books years ago and this adaption has done it justice perfectly cast the people obsessed with the diversity should know that this isnt a factual historical show but a version of georgian history that lives in the minds of all of us who love this type of thing and really need to get over it they also didnt play string quartet versions of bad guys or thank u next back in the early s basically its what ive dreamed of and waited foradore that theyve kept the main storylines but complement them with lines that add rather than subtract to the main linethank you shondaland
last season was fun fun fun with episode  all sex but thats another storythis season its full of older men vying to marry girls who have barely turned also this season im on episode  its all watery colors music and weak story nothing is really fun except for queen charlotte of course and penelope shes still a pipwheres the vibrance and verb and fun its goneanother season  where it seems that all the good writers have been dumped and replaced by ersatz staff
i loved season one watched it twice in a row i loved it so much thought they did a great job and actually improved on the book season two unfortunately did not kate and anthonys story is by far the best of the novels  the main reason being because it is funny i was looking forward to season two the most because of this and while i dont mind the overall massive rewrite and plot changes they added the writers didnt include any of the funny bits that make this book enjoyable and endearing and what a missed opportunity for character growth on the practically nonexistent library storm scene the show on its own is very well done and the acting is excellent i just hate when screen writers of book adaptations try to beef up the drama and in so doing remove all the goodness that made romance readers fall in love with the story in the first place
fun for those who enjoy the frothy visual thrust light story and modern casual take on costume drama its a trashy soap opera in a dream version of regency i do like the diversity in casting and experimentation in costume casting is strong however i cant seem to appreciate this production as much as i wanted i find the direction and delivery of lines tends to self conscious loud stagey and over the top also the soundtrack is the same thing again and again pizzicato strings not creative boring that flattens depth of emotion or drama otherwise a heady trip with lots of short scenes whipping from one character to another its good just not totally my cuppa a pleasant pretty distraction
the fact that most of the low reviews are for the historical inaccuracy it is so beyond laughable to compare this show to a historically accurate drama would the equivalent of saying that the lord of the rings is a documentary  one can not fathom the ineptitude of you withering minds of course your comatose racism has been jolted awake in your zealous defence of history and accuracy ha i say to you ha history for the most is made of fantastical manipulations by hose who concurred and won the wars but i digress since that is besides the point the point is this is fantasy  it is a genre google it
i enjoyed the first season i loved the second season even more third season was kind of boring it go so boring i just read while it was running in the backgroundi give season one a  season two a  and season three like a  and i dont think the rest of the seaon will change my mind the way things are goingthe only thing that kept me interested was the delightfully subdued interactions between francesca and john i really enjoyed how their romance was so much different than the others and not just a repeat of the same i could see the chemistry in their interactions and how their love languages were so different to those around them really refreshingas for the main story between colin and pen boring it was like bad fan fiction it was like there was no character development i felt no chemistry between the actors it was like they were just going through the motions to follow out a set outcome and then they are just having sex in a carriage which would be scandalous for such a young womani dont know what will happen in the rest of the season but i seriously dont know how colin could get over the utter betrayal of pen being lw it would be fan fiction bad writing to try and get out of that if pen gets found out for being a total lifedestroying gossip who makes money of other peoples suffering and she gets a happy ending i really dont know how it works out in the books but this pushes my suspension of disbelief too far
season  was greatseason  is as follows i love you i hate you you love me you hate me we cant be together we must be together we love each other but cant be together lets get married lets not get married its your fault i love you no joke  episodes of that lol
is it entertaining yes do i expect from fantasy to give me accurate descriptions of the world no it is fantasy dear viewer i am actually disappointed at the reviews since i am quite convinced people genuinely lack an understanding of the word fantasy it is scary out there i expected something light and lovely and with the exception of some scenes it was highly entertaining some viewers will deceive you into thinking you must bring reality into fantasy since when is it revolutionary no but it is a piece of heaven and hard work and it shows
"ever since hearing this was going to be made into a series i have been anxiously awaiting it this series has gone beyond my expectations i love the costumes the pageantry and above all the cast each character is very well represented by the actoractress portraying them i love the addition of a diverse cast it in no way detracts from the story and makes it a beautiful representation of todays society
i was nervous at first that the move to the big screen would not carry over the beauty of the story but i am happy to say that i am in no way disappointed this is a great series and i highly recommend it to everyone loved the books or just loved a great romance"
season  was exciting brilliantly written and its acting was very well executed season  lacks the drama that was captivated in season  season  did not completely win me over the plot was poor and it dragged out two characters love for each other without drama or sparkle while it is nice to expand other characters in the plot i was expecting so much more i only hope the writers will redeem themselves in future seasons
"facing a christmas day at home alone this splendid release was perfection
im halfway through and im in love with simon the very handsome darcyesque duke and the lovely daphne and the jo march frustrated eloise it is gorgeous to look at it is witty and warm and faithful to the romantic  or even erotic  literature it is based on the hand touch between simon and daphne is far more sensual than anything written or portrayed in fifty shades just luscious "
unfortunately i did not like season  as much as i loved season  i found it boring and the story line wasnt great either i hope they will change this on season 
i am writing this review after having watched the series followed by reading the book the viscount who loved me this season has offended many ardent book fans and i can see why the kate sheffield of the book and the kate sharma of the series are two entirely different people the book was written primarily for female audience therefore kate sheffield appears to be similar to readerfavourite elizabeth bennet a witty girl next door with some severe insecurities and she has her feet swept away by the deveilish playboy of the ton ie anthony bridgerton even though he is shown to have physically attracted to her he always remains in control of the situation in a way guiding kate to a whirlwind of challenges and then confusing her feelingsthe series however was clear about its narrative character ie bridgerton hence kate sharma was written for the male audience it takes a lot more than intelligence to impress a man men adore bravery independence free spirit and a great deal of selflessness the charismatic kate sharma hence knows how to ride a horse goes on hunting remains undeterred by anthonys or any mans advances acts completely selfless to the point that she is willing to walk away after leaving her family with sheffield money she therefore makes anthony crazy as he finds absolutely no control over her she pushes him to his extremes when they speak its not just a witty banter its a display of their strong character arcs kate sharma is far more of a tough cookie than in the books this is why its anthony who feels swept away by the woman he tries his best to get rid of his desire for her but she continues to make it harder by doing  well nothing yeah its weird while anthony takes pride in confusing a woman in order to seduce her he is maddened that he is unable to do that to kate sharma he is unable to break her to the point until he finally breaks and admits that he loves her he is forced to do so by his own feelings as he grows into acknowledging that what he feels for kate is far more than desirethe  stars that i have deducted is for the almost dragging subplots of eloise and penelope even if i forgive penelope storyline eloise perhaps became way more onedimensional in the nd season that is my opinionnudity in this season was toned down to almost pg level because the content was stronger afterall its about a man growing out of his fear for true love and settling down with his muse the target male audience perhaps appreciates less such scenes and more of the actual adrenaline rush
"you can rely on netflix to splash the cash when it comes to a series of this kind and bridgerton doesnt disappoint with beautiful houses lavish parties and exquisite clothes i found myself suppressing a laugh at some of the mens hairstyles which made them look like s teddy boys which i am sure was not intended
its a handsome series  the bath settings are thoughtfully and artfully reproduced and the plot is better than average with a whole string of bridgerton siblings needed to be married off everybody seems to happily live with what seems like the double standards of the era and julie andrews lady whistledown is a plot masterstroke
i am really enjoying it even if it seems to veer between mrs gaskell jane austen and jilly cooper it is very good entertainment and i am looking forward to a second season"
"i never read the books so i cant compare i had no idea what this show was all about but i definitely heard the controversy with having poc in iti really cant imagine a woman alive seeing that unbelievably handsome man who played simon and not falling in love with himthe show was sappy and soap operaish but entertaining nonethelessi laughed i cried i fell in lovethere are definitely faults to this show with many characters but its charming and i enjoyed it anywaydaphn was a bit too kiera knightly for my tastes but she was cuteanthony was one of my least favorite characters as he was joyless and just boringeloise was charming and very jo marchish which i likedsimon was so handsome and mr darcyish i couldnt help but love himi wondered if dan humphries would make an appearance as lady whistledown lmaoim glad they revealed her in the end rather than make us wait if there even is a second seasonid like to see penelope get a happy ending
also im curious who inherited the featherington home if they told us i missed iti hope will the fighter was not hurt due to the featherington betoverall i was entertained which is the point i believe i will definitely tune in for a second seasonsometimes you just have to put reality out of your mind and take things for what they are its just fiction dont take it too seriously"
"i absolutely loved it
its classic and romantic and enchanting love the cast
its perfect for everyone who loves the old classics"
this is the rd season of bridgertons and im tired new shiny costumes elaborate sets pretty ppl soothing music thats about it for this show the only book i liked from the series was book  and that was unnecessarily butchered in the name of drama in season i am not much for historical accuracy as i dont have vast knowledge on british history but i do care for a bit of logic a bit of beautiful performances and a bit of beautiful making but this show has already exhausted all of their resources and at this point everything looks like it was a chore to be donei am glad nicola aka penelope got her story for season  but boy was it felt so tiring to watch her going to a ball to just end up crying every single time the writers were just going in a cycle of dress up  ball cry  outing  dress up  ball  cry  outing i think  episodes should have been enough to wrap this whole thing upand dont get me started on luke aka colin i have never felt such second hand embarrassment for any lead like i felt for him the wooden performance with one facial expression just shows getting physically attractive can not save an underwhelming performance especially beside jonathan and the other luke who tend to steal the scene anytime they are in it just like claudia in theory the makers are telling u colin is now a suave sexy charming fella but on screen he came across confused little boy reading dialogues from the teleprompter and delivering them without much convictioni dont know why i keep torturing myself by watching these shows this cant be even passed as a time pass the makers have budgets why not invest in good writers and good storytelling even the good actors seemed like they were in the show to play dress up only and delivered half hearted performances my expectations for season  is wayyyyyyyy below 
the sets the costumes and the cast make this regency romance sparkle
ok so its not inline with history so what just give it a try my guess the poor reviews are from those who just watched one episode and sadly have zero imagination
take my word for it and just dont bother with this awful show incredibly bad is the verdict tried to like it but failed couldnt even get through the first episode ugh
i really enjoyed season one despite some repetitive sex scenes but season two was a slog eventually i started to ask myself how many more episodes to go there was much to like except for the boring love story that dragged on and on only to end up in a few minutes at the very end when rather suddenly all was well and good in the world whatever i wont watch this again and ive watched season one several times
such a fun and joyful experience to watch love the casting truly some of the dreamiest actors around
ive watched season  a month or two ago just before season  and from curiosity ive decided even to read the books in my opinion the worst books ever and i was astonished how all those actors and producers and writers could pull up such a piece from such shallow and lusty story i mean the book and above all that that actor with a stunning performance  with all my respects to all the cast and crew to bridgerton  you did an amazing job and bring joy and delight in our lives with season  but mr regéjean page just made the entire season so attractive and magnetic  he just stole the show from the first rideseason  i personally vote   for the amazing play of mr jonathan bailey but even he couldnt pull the whole thing and somehow the whole piece was looking like a patchwork even though in my personal opinion i know there are a lot of fans here of the books  the second book is even worse than the first one and could maybe make the writers job a bit hardermy admirations to all the crew  the costumes the light scenography soundfor both seasons was that good
its a great series not supposed to be the books but a different version inspired by them i like the diverse cast and the amazing costumes ive been a julia quinn fan since she started writing and i think this series does the bridgerton books proud
wow 😮 jonathan bailey and ashley simone kantony had amazing chemistry i only watched season  as i love slow burn romance recommend it to anyone that does too
as much as i enjoyed season  there wasnt enough of anthony and kates story i get that the stories of the other characters need to be fleshed out some but theres a whole part of the story in the book that relates to the time after theyre married that is juicy and got completely ignored the actors have great chemistry it would have been nice to see more of it
they bring in indian element in the nd season however research was half baked sharma is a north indian last name also the ladies refer to their dead father as appa no one but no one says appa from maharashtra onwards the writers and researchers seem to have gotten that confused i believe to get that wrong in todays day and age makes me give it  stars lessapart from that i have yet to find something that i dont like in there
my girlfriend watches this in my house and its absolutely monotonous to witness i used to complain about how bad married at first sight was when he watched it but after finding out this exists i dont even mind her watching the alternative
another shonda rhimes hit loved itfor those low ratings dont listen if you read the comments they all have the same theme divers not sure what divers have to do with the show butoh welli enjoyed the diverse cast 
a refreshing take on historical drama the humour is inspired the costumes are divine and the cast all played their parts perfectly i was hooked from beginning to end definitely recommend
not only is it an amazingly good series but it is a beautiful storyline some incredible characters that have you crying  laughing no spoilers here brilliant acting from all and great cinematography  musicplease watch a history documentary it isnt but it does have lots of spice
you were thinking to yourself id like to see season  of bridgerton with the exact same story but with two different leads and less sex then season  is for you
i binged the entire season right after it dropped like jqs wellwritten books i couldnt put it down
this second series had much promise and expectation following on from the first series i must say though that i found it somewhat lacking in some areas i felt the love triangle was very good and the tension between anthony and kate was believable i found the eloise character extremely annoying in the second series the way she treated her friend penelope was awful and ransacking her bedroom was not what you would do to a friend the queen was splendid as was lady danbury again i was also disappointed with colin bridgerton in his horrid treatment of penelope i do think penelope should have divulged her secret to eloise which would have prevented all the shenanigans of eloise i hope the third series improves
full marks to the cast and crew to bring our beloved characters to life from the page though there are some major diversions from the books the stories of all main characters remain essentially the same it does give us readers something different to look forward to some surprisesabsolutely loved the cast they are inch perfect acting is stellar and i had no trouble imagining them to be exactly who they portray thanks for bringing the bridgertons to life all of you looking forward to season  already
i loved the season  and rewatched it multiple times coz why the hell not  the chemistry  the heat  the intrigue and the story line was done to the perfection  but  season  lost the charm it was a fun watch nonethless but still the storyline with kate and anthony had so many loop holes that i cant believe how writers spew that nonsense for  episodes kate is the most undecisive character ever to exist  she keeps on manipulating her sister for marrying anthony while at the same time provoking anthony like what the hell is this behaviour girl decide something first  anothy had a traumatic teenage life which leads him into becoming a responsible head of the estate who thinks if he married for love he will suffer for the rest of his life like his mother  which is quite understandable yet anthony keeps on making mistakes the first one is choosing the wrong sister to marry and the second one is leading on kate simultaneously with his sexy soft spoken whispered dialogues the story arc of kate and anthony was a huge mess to begin with  it started off quite dreamy but with the introduction of kates intro in the scenerio it was a huge let down though i was glad they ended it properly miss kate sharma keep on mentioning im going to india for like millions of times in each episode which was so annoying  she is portrayed to be so strong willed yet she cant decide whether to let her sister get married to a man she likes or to speak up for herself  this totally ruined the show for me tbh despite kate and anthonys doomed love story  the lady whistledown and the featheringtons had quite an interesting and eventful season  the character development especially of collins and lady featherington was quite remarkable  i would also like to mention the amazing soundtrack of this season  the classical rendition of harry styles sign of times made me jump off the couch with excitement  the music score was truly exceptional 
"i havent read the book didnt even know there was one so i had no expectations of this show
i dont understand the many giving it low rating at all
its a fantasy show i dont need it to be accurate i need it to be entertaining and it absolutely was
great costumes humorous storyline the chemistry and mystery i was enthralled cant wait for more"
bridgerton is a romantic fantasy that some will find a bit of fun and good for escapism including me the leads of season  had chemistry and overall the ensemble puts in a good performance the sets and costumes are amazing so the  is for season  aloneunfortunately the leads in season  have no chemistry and their limited acting skills esp of the male are glaringly bad at times i skipped parts because the cringe factor was too much the sideline stories are okay but thats itunfortunately the actors chosen for the bridgerton family are not lead actor material so it is difficult to have each season focus on one and make any sort of real substance theyre fine as supporting characters only its left up to the other actors to really hold it together and that doesnt work in season 
please be accurate to the era at least if youre going to have a period drama ill never get back that time people raved about the series but i really didnt see the appeal
i wish people would look beyond colour its a factious period drama so what if black people are dukes ladies etc
i read all the books when they came out years ago i reread all of them before season  dropped the amount of hate this show has gotten in these reviews really confuses meit doesnt follow the book at all  duh  its an adaptation of a book  things have to change for adaptations for various reasons  and most of the changes i understood why they made them creates more drama and distinct charactersits not accurate to british regency era  duh  its a fictional romance novel written by an american and its not supposed to be based on fact what about the trailer made you think so they had pop music playing during a formal dance sceneits like these people havent ever seen greys anatomy gossip girl the bachelor etc  its not supposed to be based in reality  its a popcorn movie mindless entertainmentalso i have noticed that the most helpful reviews are those that are lower ratings and those with positive reviews are marked as not helpful  not suspicious at allcant wait to see my review get marked down as well i throughly enjoyed my binge watch  this series is not perfect by any means  sometimes the dialogue dragged the main character  daphne  isnt as developed as she couldve been etc  but the costumessets were great the drama was there i was entertained and will probably rewatch soon
wash rinse repeat same stuff over and over even the wisteria stays the same never any rain do americans not know about our climate pretty sure i have never seen anybody here in little puffed sleeves surrounded by daffodils there is no depth to anything but then how could there be when the characters just swan around in their finery ball to soirée drinking tea and gossiping what is the point to any of it
everything i loved about season  the passion the story the chemistry between the lead characters was lacking in season  the best plot lines in season  were for the supporting characters and not anthony and kate it was really much ado about nothing in the end i struggled to finish the last  episodes im hoping season  will be more exciting because this got a bit boring
im not familiar with the bridgerton source novels but this is a racy entertaining and often funny update of the austen and bronte novels every teenage girl reads that are considered classic literature and have little pretense to historical significance i loved the casting of all the major characters and the diversity of the whole cast it is not life as it was but as i wish it were it is lovely to watch and a great diversion with no motive but to entertain which it does relax and enjoy it for what it is ive never watched a hallmark movie romance and dont intend to but i feel confident the story performances and beautiful production values are on another level entirely
wrong choice of protagonists especially kate and edwina i tried hard to feel a connection with kate sharma but even the unfunny anthony performed better i would have liked to have seen the duke this season as well the characters face of debauchery victimhood or anger still made it difficult so the charisma element was something that was missing for the connection with the characters
"i really dont understand all the negative reviews for this series but i respect everyones opinion i am not a big fan of historical shows i probably would have never watched this had it not been recommended by a friend and what a pleasant surprise this series has been i enjoyed every second of it this series has nothing to do with history it is a fiction story simply set in the past lovely settings amazing wardrobe lovely cast smart and engaging story line
if you are looking for a romantic series set in an alternative past simply based on fiction then you will enjoy this if you are serious about history and how it should be portrayed meaning strictly keep to the facts then steer away from this show it is not a historical series
on a personal level i am looking forward to a season "
loved first series but series  my word so boring the characters are dull and im on episode  such a shame as i love the idea have the writers changed the characters dont seem to have any real story to get their teeth into so its not the actors faulti hope it improves soon
i have read all the books and i enjoyed it i was very excited about this tv show when i saw the trailers i was a little bit disappointed because the actors where not like i imagined them in book but after i started watching i really enjoyed it yes there are some differences in plot new faces like ms thompson but its cool i would say that maybe has more vivid plot that book itself yes ofc it would be nice to follow the basic plot but its just fine for me diversity is fine too its all part of our creativity and imagination
is there any straight black man who watches or is interested in this and not cause their girlfriend made them or is it just me because this only ever comes up in conversation when i talk about it with girls anyway i thought season one was decent maybe a ish and the mystery of who lady whistledown was really kept me intrigued and must say i was disappointed when we find out who it was but it didnt take away much from the season as it wasnt one of the main story arcs really its also funny how blindsided we were on the raunchy scenes the first  episodes or so were something you could watch with a kid next to you but once the sex starts its almost ceaseless when it rains it pours situation i was really surprised when they announced regéjean page wasnt going to feature in the following season he made most of the headlines in season  i havent watched season  yet because ive seen mixed reviews and a lot of people saying its not as good
this is the tv equivalent of delicious cake topped with swirls of frosting sweet and fluffy and beautiful to look at this isnt historically accurate and isnt trying to be it is as meaningful as any of the myriad of superhero shows out there which somehow elicit far less vitriol than this hmmm wonder why if youre looking for meaning or history this aint it if youre looking for an absolute visual treat of pretty people and prettier costumes and a bodice ripper brought to life then this is a winner enjoy it for what it is escapist fun or move on
when you see ratings of just s and s you realize that we are discussing a controversial showits actually worth watching if you like period romance movies is it historically accurate slightlybut who cares take it for what it is you can still enjoy itthe costumes are really superb and actors are good the show its a  im only giving it a  to balance all the extreme haters reviews here 
" daphne over acting made me cringe in the last scene where it starts to rain and she is enjoying the weather her facial expression completely inappropriate i mean who even does that
 simons dull  monotonous acting throughout the film just bogged me
 eloises cringeworthy facial expressions when she is nervous and overacting in every scene irritated me all throughout
 penelopes fast faced dialogue delivery left me confused all the time
 i understand period dramas follow certain dress code for casts but here i felt all the young womens cast was running out of breath due to their corset or maybe illfitting clothes
 obviously pop songs converted into classical music was also cringe worthy however there were exceptions when they played shostakovich
i would still prefer watching pride  prejudice hundred times rather than this"
"the show slaps if youre looking for escapism who isnt and if you stick with it by episode  youll be invested  everyone whos mad about good diversity and representation can shut up and go watch game of thrones 😌💅
also the costuming and makeup isnt that bad historically speaking and i havent seen brastraps once for this i give it  more stars"
so season one was steamy and tense season two was just tension that was overly abused like it was a cycle that never ended until the very end whoever plays edwina she is a great theatrical actress but on screen everything is very theater and overly emphasized like the dog could have died and she would have smiled through it its just over the top emotions with her very theateri certainly would recommend season  but season two was meh
"wonderful entertaining and an asthetic accomplishmenteven the music is exciting theres also a lot of good humour im not sure what people are complaining about the acting is superb the costumes are amazing and the story is interesting people really need to stop giving silly reviews as a way of protesting perceived political correctedness or feminism
watch and judge fairly this wasnt ever meant to be a documentary stop being ridiculous"
"i wanted to like this i really did i watched  and half episodes trying to convince myself it was working but nothing is really grabbing me i got used to dark skinned nobility easily enough but everything else  the story the dialogue the characters its just not engaging my heart in any way there is no depth anywhere actors are fine some of them are really good but they are given nothing to work with
i want to care but i find nothing to care about here"
so people are talking this very seriously for a stylized quasi historical romance here are the main criticisms and my counter historically inaccurate is it inaccurate yup based on the fabric alone hot pink not really a regency colour did i care nope the show clearly went out of its way to be stylized if that bumps you so be it but i dont believe it ever claimed to be accurate it reminds me of marie antoinette or the great in terms of intentionally bringing in modern elements look usually historical inaccuracies bother me i have a  minute rant about the mulan remake but this just didnt because it was so clearly going for a look diversity get over it oh no every character isnt white seriously people need to give their heads a shake see point  and if people are that prejudiced might i recommend every other regency show ever i am rolling my eyes skyward at the  it needs to be all white casting crew changes from the book on this i cant comment i havent read it but i enjoyed the story well enough though i have seen an equal number of they changed so much and it was so faithful reviews so i hardly know what to think no humor humor is subjective i found a great deal in the show but everyone has a different sense of humor i enjoyed many of the characters and their relationships and found that the show wasnt overly serious there were many moments that had me chucklingi enjoyed this show exactly what i was looking for in the moment it was a suitably entertaining confection light fluffy and delightful and not at all deathly serious
i didnt like the second season as much i think they made a grave error on releasing who lady whistledown really is this isnt the only issue i had the two sisters from india were beautiful but lacking in their acting abilities i couldnt buy in to either characters believability one so naïve and the other so obstinate the entire story is also very tiring it seems to go on forever back and forth and so on and so forth between the sisters and the elder bridgerton i just wanted it to be overlol i do rate it at a  though because most all of the acting from all other characters was great i love the outfits and the jewelry i could go on and on about the jewelry
it was like they took pride  prejudice cinderella jane eyre and little women rolled them together and squeezed all the character developed and drama out of it on top of that they used modern music with period correct musicians it added a new level of cringe when i heard itwhere did all the good writers go
im so disappointed in the  star reviews the creators have put a spin on a period piece never once did i sit there in disgust that it wasnt historically accurate i applauded it the diversity was a breath of fresh air it was easy to understand what was going on and the costumes were amazing do the people who give one star reviews do this to fiction movies my only complaint is that there is not enough episodes
netflix is doing great job by letting us escape the reality and live in an amazing world even if is imaginaryso watch if youre missing romance and imagination in your life a totally great serie with lovely costumes speech and metaphors
cant understand the entertainment value americans get out of bad scriptwriting for shows that take place in europe this is on par with emily in paris complete crap and forgettable
as many people have mentioned previously this series is an adaption of julia quinns steamy romance series as a long time fan of her work i was not amused by the direction this series went in i have read the entire series multiple times the books were lighthearted funny and rarely accurate to the historical time period themselves as such the historical inaccuracies in the netflix show amused me rather than irritating me the partially black cast may not have fit with the time period but then again neither did quinns original characterizations most of whom treated women with the respect they rarely had back then this is a work of fiction as reinforced by the random snippets of taylor swift and ariana grande the thing that did irritate me was the direction they went with many of the characters i loved in the books everyone that provided comedic relief in the books suddenly became mean awful or unnecessarily dramatic all of the comedy was replaced with drama simon and daphne were the only characters in this season somewhat accurate to their characters in the books due to the changes im not sure if season  will be able to redeem some of the characters enough for me to like them againsummary do not watch expecting a historical accuracy or quinns or lighthearted comedy steamy do not watch with anyone you wouldnt watch got with watch with the reminder that this is from the same person that gave us greys anatomy overall decent way to kill time in 
this was definitely a show you could binge in one day and enjoy every moment of it
"i dont believe the show ever professed to be more than a dramedy thats simply set in a different time
shondaland has never been known for its stunning accuracy in the settings and methods of what is happening in the background if the viewer is hoping for a historical documentary they may wish to watch something elseif the viewer is looking to get caught up in a love story some scandal some mystery and have a few laughs this is an excellent option it is easy to love the characters that youre intended to and hate the ones youre intended to to have your heart softened to feel joy and sympathy and even a little jealousy here and there so check your intentions before consuming"
i absolutely loved this series and i can not wait for more i understand the comments about it not being historically accurate but with that said its a fictional tale i personally like the diversity they decided to add i binge watched the entire show in a couple of days and it held my attention from start to finish
it seems many people agree that this season was less sexually intense than the first season after having watched both i conclude that against what is politically correct in this world today when one is attracted to a certain sex it does come across on screen and we are not buying it when you have to play that you are attracted to a sex you are not attracted to as a woman we know when men are not attracted to us and for that reason this came across to me with this actor i did not have any attraction to him sexually or yearn for their coupling and when i googled and found out that he was gay i discerned thats why there is a sense of maleness that a hetero man exudes that a homosexual man does not and a woman cannot be swept away by someone acting as if that is where the season falls short
this is such a good the soundtrack and the story is amazing
to be clear i watched the whole thing over  days and never once quit and turned off my tv mid episode that being said the story is atrocious none of the characters are likeable or have any depth whatsoever which is fine cuz theyre pretty the real problem is that nothing happens the end of the story is obvious from the opening scene and yet they draw out the inevitable hookup until the penultimate episode not to maintain tension but because there clearly wasnt anything else to fill the time which is odd because there are enough additional characters but somehow their stories also go nowhere still gets  stars because you can turn this on sit down and your brain will slowly unwind towards sleep
what is the point of this show in  it has nothing to offer except for being a awful version of a jane austin novel the writing is poor the script awful and acting stunted im black british and found it too cringey to watch
i absolutely loved this series once i got it straight in my head that it is not another downton abbey other than the fact that it states it is set in  nothing about this show is historically accurate there is not even a nod to propriety or history but dont be disappointed by that enjoy it for what it is a wonderful fictional show the costumes in the first two episodes are wonderfully flamboyant and entirely over the top as are the sets and scenery you get a full data dump in the first episode so be ready to absorb the characters in all their impropriety after that most of the costumes are toned down almost to the point of being boring there is romance and intrigue happening all around you so keep a sharp eye if you blink youll miss too much the story line and acting was delicious i loved every character and am ready to binge watch it again if youre looking for a very good synopsis of each episode check it out on vulture
beautifully written exceptional cast and excellent setting i look forward to seeing season 
"the intrigue of bridgerton comes from its tangled ecosystem of friends frenemies suitors and voyeurs the most exciting moments often come not from scenes of bombast but in the whispers that shape the season there are men in this story all of whom are interesting and often deeply alluring but this is a show most concerned with the plight and passions of women it does not feel the need to force highconcept drama or unnecessarily soapy details into their lives to make them interesting there are romps in the meadows kisses in the rain and meddling mothers at teatime and it is all executed with such delicate flair that bridgerton makes the usual fresh again this is not just a show that takes its own concept seriously its one that respects the romance genre as a whole and i cannot tell you how much of a relief it is to see that especially given how widely ignored or derided romance novels are by the cultural mainstream van dusen has enough trust in both his source material and the very concept of a regency romance saga the show gives every character in this vast ensemble room to breathe and the attention their unique plights deserve
creator van dusen makes bridgertons many twists and turns satisfying to the end even when theyre predictable and the young cast of mostly unknowns brings zip and depth of feeling to material that could otherwise feel slight theres a charming wink to it all  this is a show that knows exactly what it is and wears its corset proudly"
ive put off watching this as the trailer was enough to stop me now the hype has died down i had a rainy afternoon in lockdown to waste some time it was so bad the casting is ridiculous for this era the acting is stilted and has  century phrases thrown into the dialogue i have not read the books but from other reviews there is nothing to resemble them they definitely owe their success to the ennui of the pandemic
this show was so easy to binge and fun to watch i am glad i didnt pay attention to the bad reviews
i didnt even know there was a series of books until i started reading the reviews and i do sympathize with those who are not happy with the adaptation for me it was fun i like the characters and to be honest it was refreshing to see a diverse cast on the screen yes the costumes are gaudy and ott but this isnt a documentary and was never meant to be i disagree about the chemistry of the  main actors and find it very believable might want to look up queen charlottes ancestry before throwing any more criticisms around about her appearance on the show was very interesting
"i really love this show the cast is so talent has very love in this work thank you for all dedication of all cast❤
i need season  👐"
this fun piece of nonsense gives us fancy costumes spatting lovers gossip and mystery as it follows a spicy romance and various other romances nomances and romancesgonebadwhile i really enjoyed this series i was getting a bit sick of it towards the end of the season but that may not have been the series fault my girlfriend insisted on watching  episodes per night and bridgerton is really a show i would have liked to space out a little still its fun and worth checking out
i glanced at some of the reviews and dismissed mostfirst the casting was overall well done the skin pigmentation is inconsequential as the actors embody the characters personalities focus on such things perpetuates identities linked to shades of skin rather than the content of ones character particularly impressive were pages simon and dynevor as daphne they encapsulated the endearing romance and brought those characters to life my only disappointment was that page was not given the opportunity to bring forth further the anguish of the childhood strugglespeech impediment that sustained his fear of fatherhood and anger towards his father this would have further developed his screen character his portrayal of the dukes character was honest and honorablebut most of all believable page actually surpassed any expectations i had for the casting of this characterlady danbury andoh should also be given the opportunity for character development as her role within the novels is both a seamstress of matchmaking but along with that a wit unrivaled by other characters within the novel her banter displays her exceptional intelligence and insightanticipation for the next stories beautifully develops with the weaving of the characters throughoutfinally the direction of the series seems to build in accordance with the book series with few exceptions i look forward to season  and i appreciate netflix in its ability to seek out new opportunities for varied audiences
"this should not be classified as a historic drama nor is it a historic romance this is pure romance novel set in a environment somewhat inspired by victorian britain
seen in that light it is entertaining  although formulaic and predictable it makes the victorian era much more racy and racially diverse than it was so dont look for historic accuracy but if you come for a love story between two beautiful young actors that both do the material justice then you might enjoy it
the main story is classic romance novel  two young people use each other to get out of their respective problems and unintended romance ensues  but it is well acted and the two lead actors have great chemistry
the modernized sensibilities of bridgerton gives us a raunchier and funnier world than is typical for period dramas but it has less depth than most such shows possess this is to downton abbey what teen vampire novels are to bram stokers dracula if that offends you then dont watch it"
the fact that this drama need a lot of adult scenes to boost the views said it all shallow stories and plot nothing like it was supposed to be in the timeline of the storythere i said it
i am a huge fan of the books and loved season  the chemistry between daphne and simon is off the charts i love the differences from the novel the diverse cast contemporary music etc will watch over and over
i love the culture costumes and casti enjoy the storyline and believe the show will continue to do greatcheck your racism at the door stop trying to make everything black and white  judge the show on the acting and true storyline
what on earth why who how much im almost speechless at this utter dross its actually frightening that netflix can embarrass so many capable actors with such low brow nonsense and worse still that netflix viewers find this braindead rubbish even mildly entertaining everything about this production is just horrific
"its a one time watch acting is decent
the narrator sounds like gossip girl"
after reading some reviews i expected some terrible woke badly written and asinine story but after watching it i found this series quite delightful interesting and engaginggranted i have never read the books but i enjoyed pretty much all characters and story lines and the acting was quite goodi hope there will be more
terrible and boring storyline with one dimensional characters even the female characters with some agency are bland and unlikeable could hardly get through the first episode which didnt matter because it was highly predictablefurthermore what is with weird diverse casting i applaud the show for casting black actors but why only the fairest were the producers like we want diversity but not too much if thats the direction you want to take a show then why no asian or disabled charactersits just another awful show from netflix that adds nothing of value
im in love bridgerton is perfect seeing my favorite characters come to life was amazing looking forward to the second season
bit far fetched but glorious in its costumes and settings
coming from a womans point of view this show is very captivating to a little girl who is trying to find herself in a mans world this show gives hope to us women whom are stuck in a life that we seem trapped it is a brilliant well put together and i hope the director is ready to put out an amazing scandalous second season
season  was a solid  i dont know what was going on with the nd season but it felt very b rated for quality i still enjoyed it but there were some big differences in strength for this season that dare i say made it a bit boring i absolutely loved the new characters kate edwina and mary i thought they were all beautiful and fantastic editions however unfortunately the majority of the acting kate and the viscount had to be with facial expression he was absolutely amazing made you catch your breath the actress for kate had a harder time relaying desperate emotion though she frowned between her eyes a lotwhat was with the directing they made them say you vex me way too many times when the i love yous came out it was bland and casual  not like the climactic moments of the st season the green screens were awful which was a huge surprise but biggest disappointment was every single episode they had them rub faces then no we mustnt rub faces then wretch herself away over and over and a hugely overused amount of times that she happened to be caught alone by him it wasnt about the lack of sex it was the directing and the writing that wasnt very good even the things edwina was saying to kate when she was mad didnt make sense their whole argument  or hers rather  seemed forced and didnt match upif the next season is made with more effort and they pay better attention to camera angles im sure it will be back to fantastic again nd season however didnt feel like anyone in charge threw themselves into it
i was open to everything with jane austen a lot of money has been invested in the equipment and advertising but i find the actors without fire just a beautiful face is not enough to make the attraction believable the erotic scenes only served to attract attention but the chemistry between the actors is not rightthe weak acting performances ultimately caused the series to bore me despite a lot of tailwind the result is not bad but not as outstanding as it should be with the effort that all sides have made i did not recommend this series
imdb editors should edit out the politically motivated reviews is the series worth  star no definitely not does it compete with downtown abbey no its one of the most escapism driven drama enjoy it
i enjoyed this show a lot it gave me an opportunity to escape from reality for a while and to imagine a slightly different past i dont understand what is so wrong with that oh and im not a millennial despite so many people on here claiming with disdain that the show will only appeal to millennials ok boomers go back to watching your duck dynasty then and let others have bridgerton
if youre thinking of watching this show just find anything else literally anything else this is pure woke programming out of netflix once againits extremely boring the dialogue is terrible the lead actors are untalented i cant believe they made more then one season the reviews above four stars all seem unreliable
ive rated this series overall a  because of so many positive attributes its clear that many have put in lots of hard work to put this series into productioni can even look past that every dress has an empire waist because that is the most flattering and how every female character in this show is more than likely trying to secure a husband it would just be nice to see a tad bit of variety in this space otherwise so much of the plot is ridiculousi absolutely loved season  but i found season  a little more of a struggle the actors did their job and the numerous others but it just didnt have the tit package for me despite that ive stuck with it and yet somehow it just doesnt quite fit i cant put my finger on it exactly because everyone involved does a super job season  continues along those lines but ultimately i find there are so many reasons to continue watching this series and i especially love period dramasi am glad this show exists albeit some flaws
"i am extremely dissappointed with the reviews ive read
first and most importantly this a fantasy story set in london around  they want you to feel what it was to live in those times the command of the english language is extraordinary i teach english and spanish and will recommend for my students and yes for many it might sound ridiculous but if you know byron you will understand the use of modern music is just a methaphore who cares
black people in those times of course is not true but as i said before is a fantasy story
open your mind to the colours settings and the feel of london a place that it was my city for many years and is very close to my heart"
this tv series wanna be included in that new trend of denying history to make the new generations of kidults or snowflakes happy cos the true version of acts would be too harsh for their madeofglass psychethe series shows england in the verge of the georgian era in which black people are a part of the gentry what obviously is a historical untruth its one of the leftist new trend of history revision and we can see here a practical application of that peculiar mindsetit might be hard to accept but unfortunately that time wasnt a period of blessed tolerance diversity and inclusiveness instead of being a snowflake  kidult who is unable to accept the harsh historical reality it would be better to learn sth from previous eras to avoid such situations in our future what would also be in line with a wellknown latin saying  historia magistra vitaenevertheless to be honest and fair about that movie story i must say that its plot can be pleasing many people who do like all period drama moviesit contains at least in season one a mystery which is developed slowly but still gives fun of watching the series
"this show is brilliant im really shocked how many bad reviews there are i dont think people understand that its not supposed to be historically accurate in any way its pure escapism which is exactly whats needed right now brilliant cast brilliant costumes the dialogue is great witty and funny and i love the modern music reimagined in string
if you have an open mind and half an imagination youll love this"
thats pretty much itif you liked gossip girl if you like period pieces and you like a woke version of alternative history where people of colour and alternative sexuality are held in high regard and afforded all the rights and privileges they did not have in real history this is most definitely the show for you and you will love itotherwise its a meh show that only just tops mediocrity because of all the secondary qualities like costumes score locations and such being excellent while the primary qualities of directing script and acting are very mediocre indeedi for one will be giving season  a miss and only watched season  because of covid
i cannot tell you how much i actually love this show its my new all time favorite every episode had me hooked it is truly worth it the watch and please ignore the first reviews who knows what they were watching it wasnt bridgerton thats for surethe charactersactors were absolute perfection especially loved eloise
bridgerton season  on netflix was a bit hard to watch the bridgerton family had set up either eldest to marry the jewel lady crowned by the queen the storyline look a turn for the worst dragging most of the time unlike the first season that was more appealing this season the families spent more time trying to get the sharmas to marry the wrong girl love did not come into play till the very end of the season lord bridgerton played the gentleman card every time he got close to the right sharma he loved i mean come on already we all knew they were going to end up together i would not recommend this season but the music beauty and the surrounding were one of a kind hopefully next season will be better
i think american producers should stop making shows set in a european time or place its an insult to the whole continent anyone with a pinch of knowledge on english history or literature will find this show ridiculous the dialogoues are overwritten yet shallow characters annoying costumes are weird for the era like everyone wears corsets but the dresses show no waistline im no expert on historical dressing but im almost entirely sure that none of the costumes are even close to their time this is a very soapy and very wrong take on a period where title and wealth was everything and rigid rules determined the life of upper class i wouldnt be aginst pretend history if it was funny or entertaining not just putting different races and sex scenes in the show this era was nowhere near how they depict it but for this much distortion its boring and shallow it really is like a teen or american version of downton abbey
love love loved this programme i havent read the books so have nothing except the tv version to judge and i found after the first couple of episodes i was hooked i really cared about the characters and their different trials and tribulations particularly the mystery behind lady whistledowns identity loved simon and daphne and their story loved the costumes the colours the sheer escapism in these grim times i dont get all the haters and snobs calling it trash i just found it a delight from start to finish and i cant wait for the next season
i absolutely loved bridgerton the costumes were gorgeous and colorful i enjoyed how they took modern songs and arranged them to sound like classical pieces if you watch period pieces you will recognize some of the beautiful locations that were used the acting was well done and the storyline was interesting for me it ticked all of the boxes that make a period piece enjoyable it was like a cross between a spicedup jane austen and gossip girl enjoy it for its entertainment value not its historical accuracy its not meant to be a documentary i became so immersed in the story that the actors could have been purple and i wouldnt have noticed i am eagerly awaiting season  i highly recommend bridgerton
shondaland ruined historical romance in this adaptation of julia quinns bridgerton with  long episodes of wokenessjulia quinns bridgerton book series could be adapted with one movie for each brother and sister but its never enough for shondaland it needs to have all political agenda in it a simple love story in shonda rhimess hands can turn into something politicalshonda rhimes must stay away from any book adaptation and create her own original story with her own original characters
"dont expect historical accuracy just roll with it as a fantasy regency world and youll be entertainedim someone who can be irritated by the too obvious in your face wokeness and political correctness but in this case it didnt bother me at all yes there are people of colour playing it it does it matter to the story noits mainly a show about romance there if you dont want to watch something like it just dont but do not leave sour comments just because you dont like to see coloured people in a regency show or without having seen the whole thing and btw in the theater coloured people have also been playing white roles and that has been accepted as normalokay i could write a whole essay about the issue above but ill now give a review about the show itself the showmakers dont claim to have made a historical accurate show it is good they have done that because it really is modern maybe a tad too modern for my taste but oh well they wanted to reach a wide enough audience
as a fan of the bridgerton books i am happy with how they adapted the books its not entirely the same and it shouldnt betheres not enough story in the books to carry a tvshowyou can tell a lot of work and care has gone into production design the show looks greati show was lighthearted with some heavy elements and for me the balance of this was just rightthe main romance is executed well enough as you can expect from this genrethe acting itself is good the actors did as well as they couldve donejonathan bailey playing anthony bridgerton is maybe for me the most outstanding role as he seems to have a more complex personality a surprise to me was ruby barker playing marina thompson she could acted her funny and heavy moments out with ease and nicola coughlan as penelope featherington was also an eyecatcher for me her portrayal was spot onhowever some elements of the show couldve been fleshed out a bit better i suppose but these kind of shows are almost always lacking a bit of depththe show is great at what it tries to be so just enjoy it as it is a solid  from me i wouldve given it a "
"never read the book but i do love a good historical drama i havent seen anything good lately in this genre so i am probably one of the last people to see this in fact the last few i saw were so boooooorrrrriiiiinnnngi do not like modern twists on historical dramas but i love this one
i love the mixing in poc awesome made me watch beyond the first episode because this was finally interesting then you really got me with  regéjean page wow where has he been hidingi have been wondering for years who was gonna replace denzel bradd pitt and antonio banderas for the upcoming generations and now i know regéjean page
i am now looking for everything he is in i have to see all his work he is amazing not just a beautifully virile handsome man but a star this guy is a star and i cannot wait to see what he is going to do nextthis entire series was well cast amazing sets hair costume well written well done i cannot sing its praises enough and i cannot sing the praises of regéjean page enough every scene he was in riveted me once i saw him i binged watched the show and even watched a few scenes repeatedly you know the ones ladiesa star is born and his name is regéjean page"
"browsing netflix my husband told me that this seems to be the lemonade series that i am occasionally interested in so i watched it and then read the book and watched it again with that in mindall in all i liked to series a lot more than the book itself
the creators did an exceptional job with the series i love an original idea in books films and series when i feel that someone actually put the work into creating something creative and unique and in my mind bridgerton has  great original ideas
first is the involvement of afroamerican aristocracy i understand that in our pc world it might be too much for some people but for me it shows me that someone was actually thinking about a message that this show would broadcast and backed it up with a theory that for me is really creative and makes a differencesecond original idea is the whole combination of regencyera and modern world it was a catchy atmosphere i didnt mind the modern colorscale music and ambiance at all it was a really unique setting which altogether created a bright colorful sort of dreamy atmosphere that was consistent throughout the  episodes i loved iti became a fan of both the lead actor and actress as well
after watching it first i was in instant awe of phoebe dynevor she did a really good job with daphnes role she was beautiful on screen the character seemed innocent but had a genuine curiosity and intelligence i felt all her feelings instantly daphnes character was a bit more witty and funny in the book i missed it a bit from the show
i had to watch it the second time to appreciate regéjean page of course he was sexy and fit well into the character at first as well but i really didnt get the depths of simons character at first the second time i was paying more attention on his expressions and realized some less in the face scenes where i started to get it for example the concert scene when he realizes that daphne is not expecting a child and it was visible in his expression that he secretly wanted it wanted to stay with his wife and now he has no other choice than leavehowever i really wished for a bit more character development in both daphnes and simons role showing more of how daphne becomes a mature duchess knowing what she wants having values and supporting and leading the community for example i really liked how she stood up for the featheringtons after the pregnancy scandal same goes for simon here the character development was even less tangible i didnt see the struggle and the process of how he went from not wanting to get married and have child to actually being married and having a child at the endthe ending felt rushed for me i absolutely did not get the solution you stay we do this together and nothing else matters this didnt make sense for me i could use a bit more insight or an additional  min showing the doubt in simon or showcasing how he is dealing with this obviously big decision specifically here i liked to books ending more there after simon commits himself to have a child there is an extra scene where he is having second thoughts and explains daphne that he is afraid that his child will have the same difficulties with speakingfor me some of the story lines seem to be unnecessary or unnecessarily long therefore the hour long episodes were not justified in some cases or could be used to elaborate more on fewer characters life"
i love it i see so many reviews complaining that this adaptation isnt true to the books and some references to issues of race complaining of political correctnesswhilst i am a lover of literature and deeply love many books im mostly happy with this adaptation that said i am very hard on adaptations of my favorite book jane eyre so ill own my hypocrisy herei love the casting there is real chemistry between the actors and the characters are entirely believable i love the racial diversity if we are going to be historically accurate regarding race only whites can play these characters ever i find that disturbing why shouldnt we have different races playing these beloved characters this is an adaptation im white of british heritage born in  america and have watched with my heart breaking whilst racial issues continue to roil i dont like seeing black actors only get roles as servants slaves or sharecroppers  downtrodden and poor  in historical piecesmy only complaint and this may be simply my age is that theres more sex than i care to see the kissing foley sounds in film is like chalk screeching on a chalkboard to me so i skipped ahead during those scenes i am not bothered by interracial sex scenes  just didnt care for the duration of those scenes in the same way i wouldnt like it if all players were white its just not my thingi love the writing the casting the energy the chemistry the directing the costumes the cinematography  all of it love it its a brilliant adaptation  and adaptation not a perfect replicationits wonderful
season was stunning and the depth of emotions were like a painting season  however couldnt match the previous season the story wasnt weaved properly in season  and the scenes for the viscount and miss sharma were cringeworthy
we have all seen movies or tv shows that are based on our favorite booksseries some have been horrible flowers in the attic montana sky or any other of the nora roberts books harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban the hunger games i could go on but you get my point as i watch bridgerton i am enjoying the similarities and differences from the book series i think the diverse cast makes the show all the more interesting the actors and actresses do a great job of telling the story daphne and simon have great chemistry the whole cast is wonderful true fans of julia quinn and shondaland will appreciate the great performances looking forward to additional seasons
season one season two themes history regency period costume drama romance anonymous gossip british society feminism fake dating enemiestolovers courtship marriage reputation duty  familytop three characters  penelope featherington  eloise bridgerton and  daphne bridgerton
the first season was rather a soft porn movie but the second one with cheesy lines and in places forced and false chemistry is beyond bad i would have got over the total historical inaccuracies it is in the end a fantasy and that somehow should justify it all the diversity that is being forced on our throats just to show to everybody that she cares about the all the human typologies thing which would have never existed in the very conservative england of the th century centuries of racism wiped out just by a  royal marriage really the cheesy music made old madonna again really but i could not get over about how silly and shallow the second season was how its plot is simply insulting our intelligencewhere to start the queen is rather a brothel madame who takes pleasure in who is getting together with whom is more interested in reading gossip than in actually being the head of a country laughs like a commoner and what a heck is with those ridiculous wigs in  regency era was famous for its elegance and if shonda wanted with any price to show in the series the morals of the time and the fashion she should have done a better jobthen the main characters anthony is a bully who doesnt know exactly what he wants from life or imagines he knows uses everybody with the scope of fulfilling his own goals and we have to consider him charming and lovable right or to feel any kind of pity for him because he had a trauma in his youth seeing his father killed by  a bee kate is a stuck up girl whose dedication for the whinny little sister borders the ridicule and then she risks being ruined by having sex with the lovable anthony in the gardens where anyone could have walked on them and it goes onthe rest of the characters i would not bother even though i liked penelope and violet bridgertoni never understood this need the american film makers have to take destroy everything european imagining that somehow this will bring them success disney has been trying that for years killing all the wonderful children stories quite successfully then were the countless american versions of successful european stories torchwood forbrydelsen and so one and now comes madame shonda and believes that by doing this series could reiterate the succes she had with greys anatomy 🙁she should have stuck to doctors and nowadays era the historical movies are not for her not even in the romance department
"i love the books and i understand the tv can be different but please there are so many interesting interactions between c more intrestint characters than mondrich family no one care for them really eveeyone judt past forwards their scenes it doesnt add anything to the main stories that is judt netflix being inclusive or whatin general i love all the bridgerton siblings stories specially collins and francesca ypu could had more minutes even for benedict or anthonys
also seeing collin so much as a night guy snd likes the ladys of the nights was a bit disgusting more than once unnecessary i would say"
i enjoyed every moment of this lovely series it is pure escapism it is beautifully casted sexy and fun i hope there will be more of it in the future it is wonderful to see beautiful actors of color given the oppurtunity to show their stuff in a period piece like this i loved it
just look at the actual written reviews and its   or  out of yet another show with a paid campaign by the time you read this i am sure this score will drop
just seen season  the fashion is so boring the dresses are all the same just different fabrics for a period drama i prefer the mens clothing its seems to be more interesting than the women
i see people crying here that th century london was as white as white could be and they have given rating  without watching more than one episode written clearly in their review thus actually they are unfit to review this  but as racism is filled in their mind they are saying let the history be accurate when the story is based on novel not historyi liked the story and beautiful cast and by the way i have seen half the season
the music and the harmony between the two leads makes this such a pleasure to watch entire cast has been selected in scrutiny  the two leads are not really brilliant actors but together they are brilliant in the  burning for you scene watching the two of them was like watching a tennis game in acting i am afraid these two they have set the standards too high chemistry wise  and i suspect rest of the series will measure up to this the ball scenes were lovely  every detail carefully thought i also enjoyed the sense of humour throughout the script the music complements and enhances the mood throughout the series in such a great way that it deserves an emmy curious why only rege jean page was nominated for best lead though why not phoebe dynevor please consider a spin off series on the duke and duchess with same leads
ive only gotten to episode  but it has so effectively pulled me in i had to pause to review it reminds me of what an injustice it is that there are no physical markers of heartbreak  no bruises or scars  to keep a record of our agony when we love and lose its poignant and painful and artfully acted and positioned to elicit this sort of mournful relatable feelingmore broadly i highly recommend it for its fantastic costumes decor colour and cinematographylighting just absolutely brilliant i love the diversity of characters perspectives and internal voices surfacing with consistency but still there is evolution just a remarkable showps if you are looking for a new netflix boyfriend regéjean page will do the job admirably hes dashing in such a striking way i audibly said wow on more than one occasion
i have really enjoyed this show so far giving seasons  and  maybe a  yes the show is a little bit cheesy and historically inaccurate but it had its own spark and quirkiness that i think would be lost if it was historically accurate the characters were mostly likable and the tension and passion in the first  seasons are why i liked watching this third season is different i can barely remember episode one even though i just watched it the acting felt so forced and awkward and i was just bored colins character does not come across as sultry mysterious and charming to me and it is very clear thats what the writers wanted him to come across as penelope is just awkward all around i understand that she is supposed to be kind of awkward as she was an outcast but shes still coming across as desperate andor awkward in the romantic scenes i sense no tension romance or connection between her character and colin its just so cringy also why even add the story line about the mondrichs there is almost no development into their story and its just pointless every time they come on screen and make an obvious observation about their life in high society and then go away i have struggled to finish watching but as i conclude episode  i dont even want to watch the rest maybe they should have released all the episodes at once so i would have compulsorily watched the rest because i have a feeling im not the only one that currently plans on not watching when they release more
i was a bit wary of this show given the poor reviews but i absolutely loved it its obviously not a show that requires much thinking but its entertaining if you can get past the inaccuracies of the show its not meant to accurately reflect the regency period its more just for show the characters are likeable and easy to watch and there is enough drama to keep you watching its the tv equivalent to a trashy romance novel but with bright visuals and a slightly more elaborate script definitely give it a go if youre after something entertaining as opposed to intellectual to watch
no worse than the average romcom and in fact better than most so its not historically accurate because there is a diverse cast i dont recall a preface that it was based on a true story nor is that the greatest travesty ever just chill out the pride and prejudice type plot is interesting simon is fine as hell the show gets a  just for his looks alone great costumes okay acting and a wonderful diversion during some of americas darkest days i couldnt ask for more
i was actually looking forward to this show as the trailers looked promising that promise was not fulfilled i found the story choppy the characters cardboard cutouts and some of the acting very bad no passion and no life i always saw the actors and never the characters i was never allowed to lose myself in the story and feel anything for the charactersso much lost potential
halfway through i already fell in love with this show the characters are beautifully chosen and i like their acting the story is light but yet entertainingi havent read the books so cant say anything about accuracy but most of this downrating reviews cant barely hide their racismin this show i feel that it doesnt matter which colour we are and its a nice thought that history had gone the way its told herewell done shonda and haters gonna hate 
all the people complaining about the unrealistic casting and historical inaccuracies failed to understand that this is a fictional story a fictional place and is not supposed to be historically accurate its not based on any real people it was exactly as it was supposed to be it was a show with beautiful costumes part period piece part fairy tale an insight about how women were treated and what was expected of them it also showed some going their own way i thought it was a lovely show it was fun and didnt take itself too seriouslyif you want jane austin and a historical accuracy there are plenty of those around bridgerton never claimed to be that so its not fair to compare them
"no just no this is not good in two spheres first of all story is totally stupid i mean reaaaaly stupid but thats not the true reason why we are here right
i red argument that because showrunners said it goona be this wierd just before we are not allowed anymore criticised that wt
if they proclaimed its gonna be laim and boring we will not to be allowed say its boring and lame thats not an argument thats alibismnobody reasonable dont wanna see this and nobody wanna see white bushmens hunting zebra with spears both would beis rude offensive and unsuitably"
i read all the books and the writing for this series was very well done the acting was on point t and well done i cant wait for season 
one gets used to the diversity of the cast but i am waiting for mel gibson to be cast as martin luther kingmaybe it will grow on me but so far pretty lamebeautiful wardrobe and scenery
i quite like this show due to the diverse nature of it it provides a glimpse into a parallel historyi thought season  was okay but felt it lacked chemistry between the love interest however season  is wonderful give it a watch
the cinematography is excellent the actors are brilliant butthis is not historical fiction it is a spoof on high english societynot my cup of tea
"watch it for what it is pure entertainment this is not a history show why judge it as such i loved it so much that when it came to the end i rewatched immediately i love each of the characters and cant wait for more
people are so fickle im not in to horror therefore i wouldnt watch half an episode and rate it poorly id simply go watch what i enjoy and leave it to the horror fans to give a genuine rating"
the show itself is quite boring however i really like the colourful cast  at first its strange since its a period drama bet strangenesses goes away quickly and then i am seeing just actors not their colourwe shouldnt be surprised if we see a black royal maybe its not historically accurate but we shouldnt be thinking that royal could never be black this opens our minds  the history could have been differentif we always portray royalty as whites servants as blacks  it would stay so for longer in our heads and in reality
this is white trash meets jane austen applying american social decay to the english genre is just pure torture on the screen perhaps that is the idea to make fun of the english regency era with such absurd and obvious american mannerisms and ideas some might actually find that entertaining
i loved the series from julia quinn shonda rhimes reimagined characters beautiful and realistic settings makes for an extremely entertaining series thank you netflix for this christmas present and thanks for the diversity excellent acting allaround looking forward to season 
i enjoyed this series downton it isnt but still watchable other reviewers have commented on casting but this is not historical fact  it is a story a fiction that happens to be set in the early  th century as such characters can be whomever the author chooses im looking forward to the next series
still wondering what the story wasthis period drama should be listed under comedy for turn of the characters and their destinies
when you see a man with a sixpack and a finely combed lady then you know dont take it too seriously the problem is the show takes itself seriously from costume to acting it looks like a copy of downton abbey unfortunately a bit like tv films but a little better in the end
season two was interesting however it dragged seven episodes between the love pair it was annoying to watch the constant back and forth i almost became uninterested by episode six the love pair started to feel redundant however i felt the need to finish the story after finishing i only wished there was more depth in other love stories with other characters as well season two was a tad disappointing
i knew this was going to be different when a classical piece played at the ball in ep  was familiar then i recognised it as thank you next by ariana grande inspiredthe costumes are amazing colourful and sumptuous i read an interview where the costume designer praised the directors wish to give them free reign over the vision for the clothes and it paid off brilliantlythe extremely diverse racial makeup of the cast is also innovative for a drama set in this periodit is no pride and prejudice but im enjoying it
i usually dont like romance movies or tv but i really fell in love with bridgerton and all the romantic drama that came with it what a marvelous storyline actors and costumes there are so many twists and turns in the plot that i was never bored not even for a second well done a must watch i can hardly wait for season  please hurry
let me start by saying this is so not my kind of show and i randomly started watching season  just as the new season is about to begin i binged the first season bridgerton is a modern day view of women saying this is how we are treated and feel but taking the issues happening in the s and shoving in the early s in a time that actually treated women horribly and created humor and fun and slowly showing you how little women have progressed in over  years the show mixes teen dramedy mean girls harry potter vibes with gossip columnist narration by julie andrews with cinderella predictable storylines love sex and nudity and then writes about modern day issues but flops it into the s victorian high society visuals that shouldnt work at all but boarders on brilliant what ties it all together is outstanding casting colorful costumes and the race blind high society isshues and a script that finds clever ways to make fun of everything for example while high society people are waltzing across the floor to a beautiful orchestral number the song sounded familiar it was madonnas material girl
"bridgeton is at the same time historically inaccurate and accurate as my title shows but only if you place it in our universe it is a reimagined th century england or should i say even better it is as an alternative history of our universe bridgeton represents what could have been if black and asian people were part of high society it is shonda rhimes production and you ought to expect good drama great acting great music brightness from the getgo the costumes and smart writing some will say is woke and politically correct and if i followed those reviews i wouldnt have watched this delight it has woke elements but surprisingly is very subtle not out there and in your face if you pass through the historical inaccuracies you will realize how everything matches from the actors to the acting to the overall story
now what i meant by my title is this it is historically inaccurate in the representation of minorities as part of high society somewhat the liberties of some characters in public which would have never happened in regency era the portrayal of the queen as a dweller in narcotics etc but it is accurate in the shapes of the costumes with a fantasy feel of it the way they talked the balls the events everything else the creator of this show presents what our world could have looked if racism didnt exist if all women and men were equal and society see them based on their standing rather than their color its a perfect world but also there are some imperfections in this world that reflect ours i dont wanna dwell in the story but it is a mustwatch once you pass through the historical inaccuracy and take this either as a reimagining of our world or simply the alternative universe to ours  and you will enjoy it and you will ask for more i mean its shonda rhimes and shonda doesnt create garbage i am against everything that feels forced with hidden agendas like most of the moves and tv shows these days but trusts me this is not that kind of show this is a show that entertains you as all shows must be it provides an escape from the real world if only for a moment and you will definitely enjoy it"
bridgerton season  was a lot less cringe than season  ladies if you like regency slow burn romance do check it out 😁 season  is much better than season 
bridgerton is a reimagining of regency london and it deals with a young aristocratic woman looking for love and a financially adequate husband in her aristocratic circle i was fooled by the trailer and yesterday i gave it a shotunfortunately i couldnt go through the first episode even as a reimagining of th century london it is frivolous caricatural and foolish the plot is shallow and the acting unbearably overplayed since it doesnt have much to say sex scenes are scattered here and there together with ridiculous dresses vests hairstyles and wigs dialogues seem to have been written under the influence of alcoholthe queen looks and behaves like a fishwife and as such receives her guests lying back in her throne in an overcrowded narrow room which makes me wonder if anybody in the production has ever visited a royal palaceeven the opening credits are horrendous and badly madedo yourself a favor and skip it
amazing show its really captivating from beginning to end ive been waiting for a good show to watch through all this madness in the world right now
bridgerton is the perfect show when you want to escape life and indulge in some drama the girls that get it get itthe backgrounds costumes hair and makeup and coloring are so aesthetically pleasing it makes me forget that i would be disgusted living in this time period where pads were actual diapers though im easily swayed by the classical renditions of pop hits that are sprinkled throughout the episodes two hot young people in a fiery lovehate romance ballroom dancing to a violin instrumental of ariana grandes thank u next more of that please i saw someone elses review that said this is gossip girl meets jane austen and i think thats the perfect way to describe it fun meaningless drama involving the rich
if you watch thus youll get migraine for free just make it stop
as someone who isnt majorly into history and whos proffered genre definitely is not this bridgerton is rather difficult for me to review as i truthfully know nothing about the source material behind this show with that being said i do happen to know a thing or two about the art of filmmaking and definitely appreciate the show for those technical aspects the cinematography set dressing and costume designs all looks great the shows writing is also not bad as it manages to carry out many different stories happening between many different characters at once without missing a beat speaking from the mindset of someone who knows little to nothing about this genre of filmmaking i found bridgerton to be a decent period show
visually gorgeous and historically inaccurate it is wonderful escapist nonsense
julia quinn created a dream worthy charming duke in the book the chemistry between daphne and the duke should be palpable he is supposed to be dashing with blue eyes i cant buy into this there just isnt anything brooding about him zero chemistry zero not off to a good start with this one
to my review i just wanted to add that i wish i had a wisteria that bloomed for as long as the one on the bridgerton house 😀
"no amazing plot a very common ancient film on love line copying the style of pride and prejudice and gone with the wind
acting costume and set up is all above standard it is just like a mini pride and prejudice if you are not a highly demanding audience it is still worth watching"
this show is not meant to be historically accurate it is more like a victorian era set in an alternate earth where diversity is part of the norm and i absolutely adored it it is witty funny and lighthearted though still landing a dramatic punch absolutely worth a binge watch and for people saying that it is not historically accurate i say shame on you for lacking the strength to imagine a different history isnt it difficult to live with that rigid dogmatic mindset of yours
the americanized version  soap opera of british  viscounts dukes and the line starts terribly it almost is unwatchable but i continued to watch it discounting all the horrible reviews and trying to figure out why it is currently rated so highly a  by the th episode i was hooked the acting improved the gaudy display lessened and it became very likable im not a soap opera fan though i must admit in college i got hooked on general hospital because of a girlfriend obsessed with it this is much better and the story gets better as it goes along of course its nothing new but in this covid period when i have literally watched so many movies even the movies i google under good flicks that i may not have seen i found the later part of seasons one very watchable and im actually hoping theres a second season give it a try and reserve your comments until youve finished the first season one things clear all the  ratings come from those who turned it off during or after the first couple episodes worth the watch its certainly not the avengers lol nor is it near a sense and sensibility but its watchable so ease up you british boresits not like your royal hierarchy hasnt actually been laughable many times in history this only shows it to be so
the miscast cast which is already common on netflix makes this show almost a parody of so unreal lol and to make matters worse it has bad acting and bad plot lines that are just plain silly and lack any depth dont waste your time watching this nonsense that has nothing british and even less jane austen
i have read some of the books that this series is loosely created from the whole show is during the regency period with the large difference of rather than being historically correct adds a twist of having queen charlotte being a woman of color and the regent than being german and prince george being the regent i respect how the writers despite the historical anachronism show that there was true love between george iii and queen charlotte if anyone likes romance novels based on the regency period this show is for you
if the actors are people of color or white totally dont care they are people and they act goodit historical not so right but they never said is truei like the actors and the story
adore the series binged on the whole  episodes and hoping there is a season  ive heard there is some fantastic acting can see why it is no  pretty much all over the world just finished season  and whilst yes i enjoyed the previous  seasons this one couldnt take my eyes off the screen i think i have a soft spot for eloise but fantastic ensemble
watch it for what it is a fantasy with beautiful cinematography gorgeous interiors and sexy adult castthats it  period its not the history channel
delightful n delicious  binge watch if at all possible  plan to watch it again n again  should come with a warning label  the duke is hot has a great behind wonderful eyes n expressive face n body  yep defgonna watch n rewatch  n probably a few scenes rewind n repeat great period details loved the blended cast great series that should have wonderful future seasons
i found it hard to believe that the events were taking place in the th centuries i felt that the costumes were very fancy to that age and i felt the acting is more modern i dont know of this was intentional however the production is quite good even though we have seen that storyline before a noble lady looking for a prestigious match when she falls in love with a handsome and rich duke of hastings he has complexes due to a firm father so shes the hero whos going to change me for the betteri really loved the idea that the queen charlotte is black and that many black actors are nobles this was really nice taking into account the history of slavery and racismin the end its fun to watch
i thought it was fabulous just what i needed to delve in to a fantasy romance with wonderful views of times past regardless of race or accuracy of events it was a chance to escape cnn  fox news as wel as these troubling times
as long as you realize that its fine i thought it would be more witty more sparkling like the new emma movie which was quite quirky i kept expecting it to have more of a contemporary spin but its predictable tosh and heroine looks insipid not sure why she called an incomparable when she is so timidnice sets lovely dresses shame about the plot
i dont normally like this type of show  on a whim i decided to watch the first episode to see what it was like i was hooked this show is not based on actual history  and shouldnt be taken so seriously beautiful gowns lots of gossip and at times very touching ill admit to tearing up more than once please ignore the negative reviews and just watch  episode and judge for yourself its not going to be everyones cup of tea but it was certainly mine
"my review   bridgerton 
mr rating as lady whistledown would write dear reader this reviewer is always willing to reevaluate a previous first impression if circumstances present themselvesmy first impression and it was only a brief look at the netflix hit series bridgerton did not entice me to explore furtherhowever when i read that dame julie andrews had the key spoken but unseen role of narrator lady whistledown a regency society gossip columnist i wanted to explore it again and im so glad i did julie andrews voice is perfect much deeper and commanding than  years ago when she was so wonderful in another regal role as queen clarisse renaldi in the princess diaries she narrates the series and becomes a vital characters so necessary  although sight unseen the two key romantic characters in season  regé jean page as simon basset the duke of hastings and phoebe dynevor as daphne bridgerton are both beautiful and handsome in appearance and their intriguing tale and on again off again courtship and pretend court romance really got me interestedmore a comedy of manners than a comedy of errors bridgerton has a true originality about and doesnt pretend to be historically accurate or try to compete or compare with jane austens period novels  its a world of the privileged few and totally indulged it occurred to me that this this foreign world of upper class immorality is caught in a beautiful snowglobe that blocks out the everyday mundane events of the real world but still swirls around with drama and intriguethe characters are all interesting we have the dowager viscountess violet bridgerton mother of eight children four boys and  very flowery daughters daphne hyacinth eloise and francesca  what happened to daisy
theres also a mysterious cousin and disgraced ward marina thompson ruby barker  whos dragged kicking and screaming to the filthy streets of london by portia baroness featherington to witness what her life will become if she doesnt marry in haste to the first eligible bachelor who asks her whether old ugly or with an infirmity he just requires a pulsetheres some delightful moments in bridgerton i especially loved the regency speed dating  scenes where daphne bridgerton the jewel of the season  ordained by queen charlotte regally and disdainfully played by golda rosheuvel is called on by every eligible bachelor at court and presented with floral extravaganzas and protestations of affectionmy two favourite characters are the dashingly handsome regéjean page as simon bassett duke of hastings one of londons most eligible bachelors who famously refuses to marry also his mentor lady danbury played superbly by adjoa andoh  the duke is determined not to marry for ancestral reasons and plots with daphne to secure his bachelordom and her a suitable marriagethe colour blind  casting when i first watched a brief episode of bridgeton months ago took me a while to adjust toi thought it seemed a little ridiculous but ive done a full  degree turn about as the series is pure fantasy and a very colourful fantasy at that i now think the colour blind casting adds so much to this series and like linmanuel mirandas hamilton  i found myself totally ignoring the fact after a while there is no reason i could see why the characters should come from a certain ethic group even queen charlotte who is based on mad king georges spouse seems perfectly cast in golda rosheuval who was born in guyanai read each episode of bridgerton cost  million to produce and you can see why in each lavish episode  the sets by production designer willhughesjones set designer gina cromwell and its four costume designers john glaser john norster ellen mirojnick and sophie canale are truly stunning the artificial flowers alone must have cost a kings ransom i havent seen as many since the sets on desperate housewives especially the wisteria
im pleased to see the popularity of the first season of bridgerton has seen the series commissioned for a further  series  the producers certainly have a wealth of story lines to work on as the series is based on the  books by julia quinnperhaps i hope dear readerwe may even see lady thistledown  make an appearance hopefully in the form of dame julie andrews the second series is currently being filmed and will feature some of the fabulous locations of series one including bath york and chatham the grounds of wilton house were used for hyde park and the grounds of somerley were used for hampstead heath the rangers house in greenwich southeast london was used for the bridgerton house exterior and halton house at raf halton in buckinghamshire for the interior talk is the next series will further the storyline of lord anthony bridgerton the youngest son played by jonathan baileythe series music score is also very effective and appropriate written by john debney who co wrote the greatest showman  and the jungle book i thoroughly enjoyed the entire first series of this bawdy irreverent regency romp its more like henry fieldings eighteenth century tom jonesthan jane austens pride and prejudice  and its a truly original concept in many waysan update from lady whistledown dear readers while all eyes turn to lord anthony bridgertons quest to find a viscountess we bid adieu to regéjean page who so triumphantly played the duke of hastings the message beganwell miss simons presence onscreen but he will always be a part of the bridgerton family it continued daphne will remain a devoted wife and sister helping her brother navigate the upcoming social season and what it has to offer  more intrigue and romance than my readers may be able to bear"
i watched season   season  but to be honest i quit watching now after first episode of season  something drastically changed in season  yes backdrops and costumes are beautiful but the acting it quite literally is lacking when theyre speaking it doesnt even seem like theyre in the time period just reading lines trying to be in an older era and when the one couple were in bed it couldve been any show you were watching come one dont modernize it if its supposed to be in a totally different time i was quite bored through the whole thing get some people that can actually act for the time period your show is portraying certainly dont need to see anymore i just didnt care to even watch the whole episode let alone the rest of the season i have better things to do with my time thank you
i enjoyed it a lot the acting and everything good to find a good show during this year
season  was okay but season  was amazingthe chemistry between the two leads was truly palpable not only that the story was nice and loved the backstories great acting and the costumes are lovely
"i did not have the pleasure of meeting the related queen bee in words
although the series is not void of lovely sentences with true literary valueon the contrary i very much appreciate the opportunity of hearing those words thoughts dialogue and the mastery of the narrator
love scenes were normal  as i usually in many cases facing abnormal fabricated behavior fast forward them these passed as those real life has presented me considering the epoch so it is a positive experience of good takes dialogues art
stories as this are the fabric of a type of literature that transcends genres
beeing able to bring it to screen and take an old experienced viewer and critic to its happy tears falling slowly off his cheek more than the sad little tears that real man also drop was an unexpected pleasure
drama adversity naiveté social constraints love and pain ilusion and delusion what more to that stuff that dreams are made of
i see clearly a good thing to say about bridgeton
congratulations for bring us an object of that world called good cinema ou tv in an age where we see the intersection of them both
congratulations for not spending my time with monetization and infantile attempts to shock and held the tent of a circus as many unfortunate do
good ensemble
say different i have my delusions filled already with some absurd criticism i was presented here in imdb here and there
you are wrong this is good work art"
i knew as soon as i came to the user reviews it was gonna be a lot of hate we all know the reason why not going to go into that but its all fantasy ffs
this show is not meant to be a history lesson but someones alternate version initially as a history lover i was putoff by the historical inaccuracies of this show however as a very loose interpretation of the books that ive read its actually very good in its own rightthe show is extremely wellcast production quality is beautiful and ive come to really enjoy it the historical inaccuracies actually make for additional subject matter that i find extremely tasteful and fresh enjoy it for what its worth art
the first  episodes were exciting and engaging for what they are visually vibrant and engaging the second half of the season is another story so uninspired and just boring the last episode i skipped much of the dialogue and the twist at the end girl bye
this show is amazing if youve read the books then you understand the importance of this show absolutely wonderful im so thrilled with all the episodes
goodness me this is the most startling recreation of regency england since elizabeth bennett and mr darcy found zombies on their lawns a few years ago bodices are more spectacularly ripped than we usually see in jane austen adaptations although the fundamental challenge of finding a rich titled husband for your cosseted and corseted daughters is still at the heart of the story this is a georgian downton abbey quite a bit raunchier and quite a lot more downmarketwhat sets bridgerton apart is its colourblind casting simon lord hastings our dashing hero and boy is he dashing is played by a black actor regéjean page as are many of queen charlottes queens courtiers and even the queen herself golda rosheuval it takes a bit of getting used to  i kept thinking very unpc unblm that we were in louisiana and oh happy thought the slaves had taken over the plantation but the casting is the key ingredient that gives bridgerton its big dollop of freshness phoebe dynevors daphne bridgerton whose onoff relationship with lord hastings is at the core of the drama gives a feisty modernist performance but she rather pales if i may use that word in comparison with some of the other debutantesthe simondaphne romance gets too much screentime as does miss thompsons unmarried pregnancy and the mystery identity of gossipmonger lady whistledown voiced by julie andrews who alas does not appear onscreen bridgerton plays out as a period soap which is what jane austens intricate social comedies tend to be reduced to for viewing audiences mad king george is barely glimpsed and the prince regent not at all the one gay couple at court seem to have fallen foul of censorship or more likely the cuttingroom shears lets hope this is redressed in series twoseries two a decade from now well be in series ten this is pure tosh lavishly costumed and backgrounded and it will run and run
i dont get the bad reviews at all my fiancé and i absolutely loved bridgerton and cannot wait for the nd series imagining being back in the s hasnt ever looked so good
im okay with watching this film just for the fun but jane austen is an artist and her usage of words and ability illustrate people and their world they live in is comparable to a skilled painter and his brush strokes
its supposed to be based on the book its so loosely based that its a completely different story they didnt even get the big scenes from the book right i lost it once he proposed to edwina which never would have happened with the characters from the bookin addition kate is a terrible actress and her accent slips quite a bit while i can appreciate an easter egg here and there way too much of this show was about the other characters this was supposed to be about kate and anthonyi loved this book its my favorite in the series this season is entirely disappointing and i cant believe they got it so wrong
"i loved it ive read the whole series and i can understand why they made more plots one book doesnt have material to  episodes
and its ok
i loved everything the costumes the music the chemistry between the duke and daphne
loved the relationship between eloise and benedict which was another surprise lovely actor
loved the featherington plot line and the marina thing cause i didnt feel a attachment for her in the books and now i can
love the queen and lady danburry specially her been simons tutorabout anthony he is lost and the whole siena thing makes so much better for the start of the plot for the next season and how he loving kate will be unexpectedfor me it was perfect"
"is it historically accurate no is it ok to change history to suit this time absolutely
i dont get the absolute ignorance in all the comments color of the skin doesnt matter the costumes and sceneries are beautiful the dialogues funny the story engaging thats it"
this unique series from netflix is absolutely brilliant so how is it only  in the ratings it doesnt fit with the show being number  globally and in the top  in other placesthis first season is excellent and now looking forward to the second cant wait to see how the characters developthe soundtrack alone is amazing and perfectly chosen for certain scenes allowing for perfect emotion the actors are so so good and the storylines have you consumed costumes are gorgeous and delicateonly good things to say for this epic show
the first season was very true to the novel season two has the same characters but the storyline is completely different some of that is good some very disappointing
season  cant come soon enough for me and love julie andrews as the narrator
as a fan of the british costume drama i must admit i approached the series with some trepidationthe central conceit is that bridgerton exists in an alternative history english regency period where race is no longer a barrier to rank marriage and social advancement ones position in society completely determined your role and in what caste you were able to marry and this particular genre generally relies on the strict boundaries of a stratified society to create the dramatic tension in a period classic like pride and prejudice the division of rank between the bennetts and darcey and bingley fuels this tension and is one of the main barriers the lead protagonists must overcome the idea that darcey would marry so below his rank was untenable the idea that he would marry someone who wasnt european is not in the realms of possibilityso when the creators of bridgerton removed the race barrier from this imaginary world they removed much of the social constraint that makes these period pieces so compelling  one has to wonder why as an aside why the queen didnt wave her wand and remove sexism and class prejudice as well but hey its their fantasy one character whos entire purpose was to incessantly voice the lack of female empowerment seems rather hollow in the pampered environment of mayfair and when its intercut with the queen who appears to have complete control of the kingdom with a mad kingthis lessening of dramatic tension proved a difficulty for me in the central story of season one  with rank and race no longer a tangible barrier the obstacles to simon and daphnes happiness started to feel contrived and eventually you just wished that they would get over themselveshappily for me in season  the show was much more successful in portraying the dramatic tensions of the lead protagonists courtship the barriers of duty and sisterly obligation were believable and i thought the show was artful in its presentation of the slow burn and unbearable frisson between the leads like all good romantic leads they start off hating each other but the gradual transformation was artful and believable due to the two leads palpable chemistryin drama its critical because of its obvious contrivance that the viewer has to suspend their disbelief  unlike in season one season  one could put that aside and just enjoy the ride
so refreshing to see the heart of a story embraced
depsite what other people think of the show i actually do enjoy it and im not the biggest fan of oldtimey shows i know it might not be  accurate but i dont mind i love the costumes and the music the visuals are pleasing too i like the story and find that its paced well the actors are good at bringing the characters alive
"not  percent true to quinns novels but books to screen never are something i prepared myself before watchinga wonderful series even if hadnt read the books before would have still enjoyed love the twist with morden music in classic form the sets and costumes are exquisite
the cast are amazing and well castedas for those saying its not historically correct its not meant to be hate to tell you this but this isnt real this isnt based on real life it isnt a true story and never once claimed to be
dont let your racism show and enjoy the show and the actors for their amazing work and not judge the colour of someones skin  your only embarrassing yourselfonly wish the characters especially the bridgerton family members were more like their orginal novel selves there is a reason quinn fans love the bridgerton family so much writers please dont change thatcan not wait for series "
they nailed the chemistry and the slow burn i enjoyed season  so much more great performances from simone and jonathan i didnt read the book so the changes didnt bother me
i truly loved watching the first season and cannot wait for more i was stunned when i watched the extra drama that was enter into the story but it didnt make me not want to watch the series or dampen my anticipation to watch the next season for anthonys story i am definitely looking forward to watching benedicts and colins story most of all
hello netflix um please hurry up with the next season this is a fabulous show makes me want to move to england and get my own duke its riveting draws you into the story and you just cant get enough
stop trying to make bridgerton happen so cringeworthy and so technically amiss you treat your viewing public like imbeciles when you attempt to make history relatable stick with facts and historywhy do you think downton abbey was such a hit the delight is in the details
in season  at the wedding reception of lord bridgerton  lady edwina ice sculptures were seen as the show is set in the th century  s they seemed out of place a quick google search said that ice sculptures werent invented until the late th century in france this was a glaring mistake
an absolutely wonderful show brilliant cast gorgeous visuals amazing soundtrack very compelling
i think all of us who watched the two seasons thought that the director is a fool but okay it is not a historical drama there are full of inaccuracies or to be honest it is all set in another imaginary world which reminds london during regency era in some points but that is exactly the mistake of the directionthey should have inferred that it is another world or maybe they should have named the city with another nameif we overcome these problems the stories are good and so is the acting the st love story is a copy of pride and prejudice but in a more modern way so that the teens will like it while i guess they would find boring the original one the nd story has an interesting characters development which i really liked a loti think i will see season  too
i absolutely love this show i felt like it was a th century gossip girl with drama fit for that era the casting was amazing and i loved the integration of poc characters seeing that representation on the screen especially in a period piece that normally wouldnt have that was beautiful i found it extremely entertaining must watchthis series is meant to be a fun period piece not historically accurate so if youre looking for something along those lines then this show is not for youi really hope theres a season 
was this amazing  no was it we had as what people plate reviewing def not think a mix of gossip girl and revenge and put it in the  costumes the fact that a creative choice in casting was made should not be met with so much anger and hate this is not a historical piece and to give it more than they is obscene its soap in rather elaborate costume watch it to be entertained  as the storyline is pretty weak and obvious but still enjoyable
"first off the inaccuracy in this show doesnt come from black aristocrats as so many people have been complaining about clearly these people are uneducated idiots with no comprehension of english history particularly in the late th and early th century who have also never watched the film belle based off the true story of dido elizabeth belle a mixedrace british heiress born into slavery taken back to england by her father and raised by an earl so the idea of black aristocrats is not so ridiculous as these ignorant foolish critics complain about it being not all black people were slaves in england maybe try looking at black communities that existed during elizabeth is reign who were ordinary people and not slaves to correct your clearly illinformed assumptions  particularly the bbcs article entitled britains first black community in elizabethan london
now that thats cleared up i will say that this is historical fictionromance and as always allowances can be made for historical inaccuracy because the history part is often less important in these sorts of stories than the romance and im certainly not watching this for historical accuracy  if i wanted that id watch something on the smithsonian channel
i dont normally go in for romance but i have to say that even the rather outlandish plot the hideous fashion that the featheringtons favour and the slightly overdramatic nature of the entire thing hasnt put me off or dulled my enjoyment of this series it is entertaining and an escape from the dull rather bleak reality were all living through at the moment and so in that way it provides the perfect kind of escapism something completely unlike real life where true love wins despite all of the troubles along the way and the bad guys have their downfall im thinking particularly of daphnes first suitorproposal she throws a particularly good punch so well done daphne gossip girl set in a historical though fairly inaccurate setting and thoroughly enjoyable"
the romance novel is a guilty pleasure reading one is like eating a bag of potato chips with a pint of ice cream you should have a better book but nahso goes it with this series the costumes settings and people are beautiful the plot is cobbled together from austin and shakespeare and days of our lives the characters are the same plucky heroine and cranky duke types that attend every bodice ripper acting is mediocre the peasants in this show appear to have figured out baths two hundred years before indoor plumbing the dirt roads are perfectly graded the streets are free of horse frisbeesi have to admit i binged the whole show as much as i complain about this kind of presentation it does take me away from current events i need to step out of the real world into this fantasy i looked it up there are nine novels in this series not sure i ant to hang out with these bridgertons for that long
season  of bridgerton was wonderful but season  is a huge disappointment season  followed the book but changed aspects to improve the overall story the show does not follow the book at all for season two instead it is just a slow frustrating story lacking the romance we all desired book two is my favorite from the bridgerton series but the second season felt like a chore to get through i feel like the kate from the books didnt even make it into the show hopefully they can redeem themselves although i have lost all excitement for seasons to come
i am thoroughly entertained and thrilled by this shows revolutionary vision
"if you read the books and want everything the same im sorry but even the best movies can be like the books of they are based for
so with that in mind you need to watch this series really its a piece of an art from shonda and chris its complety difference of everything we saw until now about them and they were so faithful with our fellings about the this incredible family and characters since simon is describe like a different man so i think the actor was awesome the actress who plays daph is marvelous both are all the crew are and since im historian i can assure you guys the black people was  and is of course but at the time was a very important part of society since queen charlotte is describe as an almost black woman then i think thats not a problem and the actors are amazing the serie is amazing is almost like as the book but we can meet better the characters of the next books witch is good for a show lets be open mind guys lets enjoy this beautiful series lets support the show and everyone julia quinn too she is so happy so i really believe they maked a incredible show and i hope we have more seasons"
i have no problem with colourblind casting in this kind of production but it annoys me that in the uk there is twice the population of south asians as there is of black citizens and yet this is never represented to the worldblack talent always pushes out asian talent in colourblind casting for international audiences and this is a deliberate manipulationand why is there not even one single east asian actor in the extended cast shameful
actually i hated it when i turned it first on i didnt want to watch it because i was expecting poetic jane austen historical period drama and not an americanised politically or whatsover correct u call it now days show yes i am reffering to the fact that there is a very diverse cast in a english th century setting but yes there is a but i gave it a chance and surprisingly its entertainig you just need to accept it as it is a fantasy story for adults more or less a pretty naive gossip girl version so if youre not a historian but a teenager or a housewife in your s and up who enjoyed the grey shades you will enjoy this easy story with a lot of unneccessary sex scenes starting episode  nice costumes and nice filming locations so enjoy or dont
i have not read the books and not normally one who loves period drama but with a family who all do i found this one of the best period dramas around loved all those casted
i want to give this a higher rating i really do i love period pieces and it was nice to see pocs not treated as subhuman i dont care that its not  historically accurate im watching it for the love story not a history lessonone of the major problems i have is how many sex scenes they were there were normally at least one per episode and it wasnt necessary i want to watch a drama not pornis it the absolute best drama in the world no is it enjoyable yes
"this show is so far the best adaptation from this gender i can see how some people is going to be unhappy over all the changes but in my point of view all changes came from help it
i love how they gave us something we was asking but also some details we did not know we wanted as any adaptation
im also deeply happy that they kept all the important moments but changed the lines
regé is perfect for simon role phobe was able to make daph even better then the original character
even this small detail about anthony falling in love and having a broken heart over his affair with siena which we do not see in the books at all was a good thing from the place i stand
its a drama show and thats precisely what shondaland gave us i cant wait for more"
"episode  season two edwina slams
the door on her wedding gown train  that scene should have been redone  also this series is nothing more than a soap a opera set in the s sometimes a yawn fest "
"fabulous acting and a very compelling love story
cant wait for season "
found silly but quite erotic some good acting from some of the characters should be mentioned 
"this show has great production values but thats about it it looks great the plot is a joke the casting is a joke and totally unrealistic for the time period tons of minorities to be politically correct but sorry thats not the way it was in  england lol
the characters are totally uninteresting i usually enjoy british stuff but this is super weak i cant believe this many people watched this show this show honestly encapsulates the dumbing down of society"
simply wonderful well acted and delightful in its visual design
as a huge fan of the books i had low expectations but this series is great the costumes the regency day to day life i love the characters and the diversity they arent trying to wash away history its a dream reality of escapism stop making this roots or color purple its a period high production romance and its amazing and enjoyable witty and emotional and entertaining eloise is my favorite and im interested in seeing her character explored
i loved every minute of this ive never read the books i had no expectations whatsoever and i couldnt care less if it isnt historically correct its jane austen meets gossip girl its romance drama and schemes if you want a documentary go watch something else this is great entertainment just as it was supposed to be merry christmas
thats it nuff said but apparently i need to write more to publish so i will say againthis is quite literally  shades in a different era with even more drama i finished the first season but really dont care what happens to any of the charters well i lied eloise that chick is hilarious
beautiful costumes setting and story no i havent read the book the review is about the show if you enjoy time period pieces with a twist and romance youll love this show just watch it
this is a pride and prejudice style romp around regency london in the style of gossip girl or the oc with a hint of wes anderson and a smattering of baz luhrmanperfectly watchable and entertaining fairly fast paced colourful and fun it is not high art or history but not is it meant to be things like the colourblind casting to me added to the energy and  hell  why notif you want an accurate costume drama this is possibly not for you but give it a whirl if you want a bit of fancydress fun and intrigue have a crack
i have to admit that there are differences from the book series but i am ok with that as any one how has watched a movie or series based off a book knows it is never the same that being said i enjoy most of the changes that they have made i think that they add to the story i am looking forward to see what happens with the rest of the series
"i thought it was entertaining and not terrible but nothing special
it would be nice if people realised that just about nothing in this show is historically accurate not the costumes not the hair not the jewellery not the music not the dancing not the way people speak to each other etc etcmaybe just the houses they live in so to say you have a problem with the diverse cast because its not historically accurate is just plain stupid
i personally found the chaotic and unruly mixing of completely modern and historically inspired styles to be annoying and distracting but the diversity of the cast members had nothing to do with that and i thought the actors were all doing a pretty good job
anyway if youre looking for a somewhat accurate historical drama just go watch something else theres plenty of good stuff out there"
"this time i must make an exception i havent read the books and only watched to spend a little quality time with my wife many reviews talk about historical accuracy and lousy this or that first let me add to the complaint
the story takes place in  many of the hairstyles and clothing styles came into being in the late th and early st centuries people are smoking taylormade cigarettes the first very unreliable machine was made in the s a reliable machine was invented in the s dont even get me started on the cigarettes having filters it must be noted very few complained when denzel washington was don pedro in much ado about nothing or a hamlet that appeared to be during ww let me also mention benedict cumberbatchs sherlock
now this is shondalands interpretation of classic literature nothing more the acting is very capable the sets and costumes are quite eyecatching im a bit of a purist and prefer my classics left in their natural habitat but my wife and i quite enjoyed this i also liked sherlock kick back with a cocktail and enjoy"
i havent read the books that the show is based off of but i really enjoyed this series if you are glued to the screen when drama and love is underway you will enjoy it i believe it was a good choice to have this show set in the s i know other reviewers are saying it didnt add anything but i felt like i was in another world while watching i believe the innocence of the characters especially the females wouldnt of worked in this day of age the chemistry between the two main love interests daphne and simon is wonderful and shows no restraints beware of the frequent sex scenes the situations of integrity and titles really fit with the time as well the pain passion and tension between the characters was portrayed beautifully and added a lot of depth and emotion to the scenes i also enjoyed the modern songs turned classical it added a nice touch along with the integration of color among the actors obviously this wouldnt of been common in that time but i believe they all fit the role perfectly and i couldnt imagine other actors playing the parts
"this show is the absolute definition of a perfect show in my opinion it has everything you need and are looking for in a tv show it has the drama the romance the tension the anger the humour and much more i believe as well that any person of any age would enjoy this show as much as i have
yours sincerely
lady whistledown"
wow im not one to normally write reviews however this series really caught me off guard despite the elegant wardrobe and setting this is far from your normal period drama i might be in a minority however your regular pp and little women havent held my attention half as much as this has reading other reviews i dont mind the inaccuracies as frankly this series brought someone new to the genre and was a whole lot more entertaining because of it so to those who relate give this a watch maybe you will surprise yourself
the production and wardrobe steals the show while the actors shine in their own way yes it plays like a romance book corny over the top at times but quite enjoyable
i have only watched  episodes so far and so maybe it isnt fair to judge until i have seen the whole season but so far im kind of meh on the show i do really like the characters of penelope and eloise but i just find the leads kind of boring and the drama of the show feels like something out of a teen girl fanfici dont know its not the worst show in the world i could probably finish off the season just fine but at the same time it just hasnt really captivated me if youre looking for a period piece show that has modern flair to it the great is a helluva lot better
i loved the campiness and the tongue in cheek soundtrack i also liked the gossip girl twist
central parts of this filmed fantasy arent far from old fact back in the day king george iii of england married sophia charlotte von mecklenburgstreleitz a mulatto of the portuguese aristocratic bloodline who in fact actually looks like one of the female characters they had  brown babies which ran all through the prominent houses of that centurythe scenes are slick the intrigue compelling  the minds of man are nodoubt the same now as always game as it is played on an upperclass level of privilege and prestige a good watch
personally i really liked this show loads of people saying its not historically accurate and theyre just trying to be pc etc but who watches period dramas for a history lesson queen charlotte was actually the first black queen in the s wife of king george iii i just thought it was an easy watch and a good drama which is what it is i didnt watch it expecting to learn history
this show is suppose to defy tradition and demonstrates that period drama are not limited in scope or audience this show isnt meant to be real history but more lavish sexier and funnier than the standard period dramaso if you can break away from what we know about real time during this time and open minded that you might find the show good
what if race never mattered or in context of the show celebrated cultural diversity this is essentially what bridgerton is it is not wiping or rewriting history instead using our observations of modern society and transplanting into another era just watch this for the snappy dialogue great characters and classical interpretation of modern music
average easy going nice watch some of the characters were unnecessary and some were great
pure escapism ive read the books so was looking forward to this virtually stunning
"great acting beautiful storyline
dephne is so innocent yet so powerful and the dreamy duke who was just perfect honestly their chemistry is why i think this show is great
but my fav is eloise claudia make this character so lovable"
painful and cringeworthy theres not much to say about this its just a swing and a miss the great did an awesome job of seamlessly integrating a diverse cast in a story which would traditionally be super white this attempt was clunky and thats not the worst of it the writing is iffy and the romantic elements are downright uncomfortable i could go on but this review isnt worth your time any more than the show is hard pass
it was entertaining if youre looking for an epic historically accurate piece then this isnt it and it doesnt pretend to be its just a modern love story with a victorian era backdrop it succeeds at being that i think the leads did well and had solid chemistry although surprisingly the best couple to me was anthony and sienna i enjoyed their scenes most of all everything between them was so intense their passion overshadowed the leads a bit for me those actors really delivered
unlike all these other reviewers who hide behind some other reason to hate on this show i found it refreshing this show has a lot more substance than the other typically woke dramas that are out there
difficult to know where to start with this one clearly historical accuracy was not one of the goals in terms of the varied ethnicities of the cast but the production team had no intention of producing a factual replica of regancy england dallas and dynasty in the s featured mostly anglosaxon casts as did many soaps doctor who and james bond were always older white males until recently either productions strives for accuracy or they can modernises the soap opera format using the best actors for the part it seems that some people are finding it uncomfortable to watch but that is there problem not the production teamsto the series then clearly some liberties have been taken with the source material but it is difficult to tell the same story as a book especially when set in this period the dresses and suits worn by the cast are wonderfully colourful and the sets are fantastic it is a fantasy soap opera so theres an element of camp but it helps move the story on the pace is good only slowing down for back stories when the narration keeps the viewer interested the speech is modernised but it doesnt detract from the plot the who done it element keeps you guessing with several red herrings not worthy of agetha christie but i kept watching neverthelessto summerise suspend your disbelief for  hours and it will be a lot of fun judge it by the standards of bbcs pride and predujice colin  jennifer and it doesnt quite get there but no period drama quite beats pp does it
"i loved it its a beautiful romantic historical fiction featuring a lot of scandalous behavior secrets lies and of course good old fashioned romancesimon regéjean page and daphne phoebe dynevor have a chemistry that i had yet to see on the big or small screen  one that mirrors real life romances the dislike on both accounts is obvious watching it grow to love was beautiful and stunningbridgerton isnt about the accurate retelling of history its just a show that has taken freely a specific era of history period dramas have often and rightfully been criticized for lacking in the diversity of its cast and bridgerton is evidence that a racially diverse cast can not only work but add to the beauty and appeal of a costume drama another important contemporary touch is all of the soft sex scenes female pleasure focused sex scenes actually interwoven with its contemporary sensibilities and sneaky feminism is a comfort with portraying female pleasure that is widely missing from pop cultureso if you prefer accuracy over diversity and wokeness this show isnt for youspoiler
i would have give it a  but the th episode where daphne assaulted her husband made me really uncomfortable"
for those enjoy costume drama this series wont disappoint but neither will it i suspect be long remembered the writing lacks the confidence and humour of british shows in this genre while the costumes and sets are as beautiful and sumptuous as weve come to expect some of the other production decisions like the cgi cityscapes and one particular horse riding sequence are jarringly unconvincing the acting is fine only sometimes hampered by clunky dialogue which flips wildly between stylised regency and modern englishits entertaining escapist fluff and passes the time pleasantly enough but im fairly sure i will have forgotten all about it by next week
"the actors the dialogue the architecture the art the colors the costumes everything transfers you to another beautiful world you almost feel enchanted its just so beautiful
 a must watch"
ok so season  was a solid  for me when i heard page was not returning true to the books i didnt think id tune in to season  while season  had plenty lets say seduction and passionate scenes season  toned it down somewhat that was ok i was instantly smitten with the viscount and kates relationship i flew through episodes  with  climaxing see what i did there however the final episode  disappointed a little you cannot beat the wit costumes and modern day music played by the orchestra my fave is eloise the queen and lady danbury
i loved the first series and then read the books unfortunately i think this has tainted my view of this series i keep making comparisons and i dont think i like some of the changes made from the book especially to the edwina character she falls for someone at the aubrey hall party in the books and never falls for anthony and they never get engaged they also really pale down kates fear of storms its one of the turning points in the book in their love story when he sees her in the librarythe whole back story of kate being a nobody and not being a sheffield is completely wrong it makes a mockery of the marriage if she isnt of aristocratic blood and takes the plot of benedicts story next series nearlyi dont think they needed to change the story as much as they did to make drama i understand some changes from book to tv but this is almost just names that are kept the same and in fact they changed thoseif youre not a book reader youll probably love it i love the aesthetic of the show and it is good escapism
good grief the reviews nagging on this about the historical accuracy  its a guilty pleasure people its meant to be funny sexy and gasp entertainmentthe show is engaging with a wide variety of humans playing different kinds of human strifes struggles and challenges so throw your history books away and live a life of wild abandon by giving into the dark side
with everything going on at the moment i really enjoyed this fun show it doesnt take itself too seriously and i love the diversity in the casting if you like rom coms and just want something relaxing and easy to watch then this is good
its a parody of an historical drama without drama humour or any redeeming feature at all julie andrews is embarrassing even the sex scenes are so coy as to be a turnoff the two leads might have potential if they appear in something else that takes itself a little bit more seriously
enjoyed the usual jewelry dresses etc story was good lots of adult content
ive read these books multiple times they are adult fairy tales no one lived like this ever elements of it are true reputation not facts were everything the series and the books are bodice rippers with happily ever afters the series is a break from our chaotic world where inflation makes you stay home more the men usually come to their senses and say the right thing the women are beautiful and the clothes are fabulous they took some libertiesso what its so much more entertaining than the lies the press pedals as a school teacher i need a break from deadlines abuse of children and my insignificant paycheck i can sit in my crappy tshirt and watch pretty people work through drama and end up happy good times for real lady danbury is my favorite the actress does an excellent job portraying her
i am a big fan of this book series so was very much looking forward to this adaptation as a series by itself it is not bad it does however differ greatly from the book series so if your expecting a true adaptation this is not it the essentials are there as the ground work but there is much that is added and changed which doesnt mean its bad just different i enjoyed the series and am curious to see how the next season goes especially to see how penelope looks in the next season those of us who read the series were not surprised by the reveal at the end
this was a fun series i think there are too many angry british people rating this series and people want to call it racist or offensive but its exactly the opposite of course none of this took place the way its staged in the show its a show relax its not meant to be accurate its making something old new again and fun for a new generation to enjoy if you take it for what it is youll enjoy it its a modern take on old times its fun nothing is accurate for the time from the clothes to the casting to the storyline itself but its a great watch i loved the costumes the actors were really enjoyable to watch i binged it in a day julie andrews is a great pick for the narrator and even the orchestra pieces are updated with compositions of ariana grandes thank you next in the background if youre no fun than you wont enjoy it if you want an accurate period piece watch pbs and get over yourself
what a lot of camp nonsense and i loved itthe historical accuracy leaves a little to be desired if people of colour had the respect and social position back then that is portrayed the world would certainly be a better place now than it is at first i thought this was just colour blind casting but the issue of race is very briefly addressed in the dialoguefabulous costumes acting production values in generallooking forward to where they go with a second season as daphne and simons disney prince and princess but with shagging story has been told im assuming theyll be looking at the other characters in more detail theres plenty of scopei guessed who lady whistledown is 
too many haters taking this so seriously my husband and i binged all  episodes in two days fanciful beautiful scenery costumes absurd linesi mean if youre looking to lose yourself for awhile in a simple fantasy alternative realitywhy not i didnt want a history piece it made me smile laugh and yesit has many true romance novelstyle love scenes but hey i enjoyed it like i did those cheap novels by the pool during summer when i was young dont take it seriously and you should enjoy yourself no i didnt read the books
i loved the first season was great a little lacking for family characters but that was made up in season  however s leaves you a little disappointed no where near as much steaminess as s and although i liked that story line and how we got to see more about the family as whole we never got to see the duke just the duchess and it felt a little drawn out how long we ahd to wait for the conclusion we all knew was comestill a good show and still enjoyed watching it very much but s was way better sorry
basically this is a teen soap set up as period dramaterrible acting awful characters and cringeworthy dialogue i spent most of the time laughing or sighing
absolutely loved season  even more than season  which i must add i enjoyed also season  was about forbidden love longing looks desire and passion without needing sex to show this and i commend them for it because many times i had to pause whilst watching because it had me on the edge of my seat i thought the main actors jonathan bailey and simone ashley did an amazing job at conveying the emotions of two people struggling to choose between duty and love also charithra chandran playing edwina was far better and more complex a character than was written in the book i must add in particular charithra acting in episode  was fantastic i cant see how no one could enjoy it i will be rewatching again until next season is out i think people will have to understand its a series of  books with  different characters falling in love and it will show different facets of love they cant all be the same as season  or  better to go in with open mind
so good i loved every minute of it i hope there is a second season
brilliantly made series from the amazing netflix i cant believe the bad reviews i think there is some kind of jealousy going on or people are too narrow minded to understand lavish sets great detailing beautiful costumes and fantastic cast and acting from all love the use of modern music played with violin so creativehurry up season  and move on virus so we see it quicker
what gossip girl would have been in the s mixed with pride and prejudice really intriguing great storyline and suspenseful ready for season two
it was exciting and interestning and much love in it and obviously based on a book
built boldly and gaudily on imagination rather than historical accuracy but for all that loads of fun for a winter binge watch gowns bosoms corsets imaginative bumping of uglies in all kinds of contexts maidens dishonoured and men deceivedits an absolute hoot the script writers seem to have played arcane word bingo working obscure words into strange syntax like crazy should as the main verb again and again i should retire to bed should you not join memonthlies with child and coming out litter the dialogue and one episode had the writers vying for the number of times they employed the phrase leading strings it is all imagination and fun but even so someone in continuity and scripting needs a talkingto about the missing diamond necklace watch it to spot it  i thought it was a plot twist but it wasnt it also has two pure comedy vignettes of the close up of actor riding a pretend horse type
i love it and how the roles of expectations in society are reversed very good and worth watching
oh dear so many awful reviews i wondered if i had moved into the twighlight zonethis is set in regency times king george iii who now historians believe may have been suffering with porphria a bored queen charlotte who filled her sad days with games manipulating her royal subjects it wasnt until part way in i realised she was being played by a black actress i thought she was amazing actually her face said it all she obviously loved her husband but had no idea how to deal with his madness and everytime she could she should visit him in more lucid moments it must have been quite hard for her to deal withthen she meets the beautiful and flawless daphne bridgerton it was then i was slowly introduced to the family daphne an innocent who was meeting the queen on her coming out with comments of the queen one would expect daphne to have a queue of suitors well she did sort of but sadly her over proective brother ruined that for herthe story is slow unfolding we get to meet all the main characters and their stories enrwine within the story we get to meet the family the bridgertons i loved the mother and eloise too and the eldester brother who was lost as he just had no idea how to run a family and was besotted with an opera singer benedict bridgerton bored of society who slipped quietly into the unknown world of gay and orgies and arists colin a quiet young man kindthen we met the duke and i fell in love lol we learnt of his terrible childhood so bad it turned him away from love and family his fathers cruelty he was only saved by the lovely but fierce lady danbury who i fell in love with such a wonderful characteri just loved the series never read the books its truly and epic love story whats all this woke business i never noticed the characters ethnicity if people dont think there were a mix race going on in regency times well they need to get their heads out of he sand the morality in that time was pretty non existant anythinig went and shonda rimes used the right mix of it for mei have recommended this to many of my friends who have now binged it and all loved it we cant wait for season its full of intrigue incest homosexuality you name it well its in thereas to queen charlotte several historians have said charlotte was directly descended from a black branch of the portuguese royal family alfonso iii and his concubine ouruana a black moorwatch enjoy
only two episodes in but highly recommend for its almost perfect blend of genres with a delicate touch of mystery comedy lust and scandal once i lowered my expectation of a deeply moving drama and relaxed into shondalands virtuoso ability to entertain bridgetown becomes most entertaining nowhere near a marie antionette but could classify with downton abbey
"anyone who has read the bridgerton series will tell you that the viscount who loved me is a fan favourite it is full of funny moments iconic kisses under a desk a bee sting and an unforgettable pall mall gamewhile one does expect changes to the story for tv adaption one hopes that these elements of a really great story would be kept intactlets start with the good thingsjonathan bailey and simone ashley absolutely personify smouldering anthony and fiery katethe rest of the cast is equally brilliantthe music is better than sthe choreography is brilliantthe cinematography is sweeping and majesticthe locations are swoon worthythats it thats the extent of what is good about sthe fun romcom that i sat down to watch was nothing at all like i had expected since s i had expected that there would be plot changes and additional plot lines and charactersthe first two episodes trudge along nicely ep comes on and its probably the best episode in the whole season then come episodes  i had to force myself to watch these episodes one word boring ep sort of redeems itselfby making one crucial change adding a dumb love triangle they completely destroyed the edwina we were expecting to see the fun part of the book is when edwina tries to matchmake kate and anthony in the show she transmutes to a screaming emotional wreck whos completely blind to her sisters feelingsfrom a romcom the series becomes a maudlin melodramatic soap opera worthy of any s bollywood screenwriters the tropes are so overdone its a wonder i actually finished watching itthen you have the clueless cultural appropriation this was offensive on a personal level
a kate speaks in hindi when she first meets anthony
b she calls her sister bon mispronounced a word used in bengali for sister
c claims her sister speaks hindi and marathi but not bengali
d calls mum and dad appa and amma  when in marathi should tai and baba and mababa in bengali or hindi
e the haldi turmeric ceremony was straight out of a bollywood film there was no turmeric powder in the th century i laughed so hard when i saw this why was the turmeric mixed with anythingf the decoration on the hall floor alpona is again a bengali touch if it had been in colours it would be a rangoli  more appropriate to marathisall of the above is easily available on googlethe arrogance of writers in imagining they could turn a fan favourite into something better is breathtakingi have no wish to see anymore bridgerton stories on screen im sure they will be equally mangled"
if you enjoyed historical romance with a bit of scandal and swoons thrown in then this series is for you the historical accuracy is nearly zero but the series was well told as it almost retold the novel it was as captivating as the book and an easy watch
its a cute entertaining mildly predictable romance the reviews would be higher but netflix dared to cast a few black actors and internet commenters cant have thatignore the bad reviews its a solid b if you like romantic dramas
no historical accuracy no chemistry no quality acting i am really sad i read the book i was waiting for something spectacular dont misunderstand it is not terrible just not good and disappointing
found myself home alone for a week and was looking for a guilty pleasure to indulge in i had started bridgerton previously and thought it wasnt for me after the first episode but decided to give it another try once i got past episode  i was very much into iti havent read the books associated with this series but understand from other reviewers that each book is based on a different bridgerton siblingseason one is good the stories weaving around it kept me interested theres lots going onseason twommmm not so good second seasons always have a lot to live up to anyway but for me i found the character of kate sharma to be highly irritating i disliked her so much i didnt want it to be a happy ending for her and was hoping that she would die after her riding accident to bring an end to all this unnecessary farce and make things a bit more interesting this is nothing to do with the capable actress who portrays her but the way she was delivered to us in the series i couldnt understand why anthony would want to marry the older sour grumpy irritating and troublesome sister when the younger one was so kind pretty and nice none of it made any senseoverall the series is slick beautiful funny charming and sexy the costumes and scenery are amazing and the musical score is wonderful im looking forward to season if you look beyond the controversy you will find a fun light and entertaining series which is exactly what it was meant to be
that was an enjoyable watch well acted good storyline and undeniable chemistry between the daphne and simon bring on season 
this isnt the worst show in the world and its definitely not the best ive seen reviews comparing this to outlander and sorry its no comparison outlander is far superior  fiction standpoint as a work of fiction its a fun story there are characters we love and othersnot so much the pace isnt dragging and its a cute love story  historical standpoint from costumes to race this is not historically accurate and that rubs wrong quite a few people while its a fictional story there are real historical people represented in a time period that was also real for those that love historyhistorical fiction its hard to move pastif you want a cute love story no matter the time period with the drama of gossip then youll probably love this show if you are looking for a historically accurate show like pride and prejudice outlander or downtown abbey then this show is probably not for you
i as a black woman am very happy for the role of regé for the performance and delivery to the character bridgerton is not perfect there are things that could be resolved in another way but it was still amazing incredible characters thank you shonda
i cannot believe the negative reviews here hiding behind the i do not like it because it is not historically accurate you are just racist like who cares what difference does it make if the characters are other than white none of us lived in the  so who cares we have had enough of historically accurate movies sometimes things are made to be entertaining i love to see all people living together in harmony this show was nice not the very best but it was okay
we started watching bridgerton as a kind of concession to my wife who is a huge fan of pride and prejudice the movie the novel the series i had no great expectations but the trailer looked nice and i liked the main storyline of daphne and simon pretending to be in love to flee the social restraints of the regency era of marrying the daughters away in the ball seasonthe first look was a bit irritating with less convincing cgilondon candy colored look frilly dressed girls and overly wellbuilt men in a jane austen memorial story also the many colored actors were a bit irritating on the first look especially for a rather historical piecebut my wife liked it so i watched it along her while reading i thought beginning with the punch in the face of creepy nigel berbrooke i while reading noticed more and more wonderful plot twists the brillant soundtrack with its string covers of famous songs the vivid look the great production design and last but not least the captivating chemistry between daphne and simonso with each episode the reading got less the watching got more and slowly all the criticism from the beginning not only forgotten but got fused into an extasy of pictures and sound forming a fairytalepopversion of the regency era in which skin color does not matter while restrictions of nobility and etiquette still matter enough but what mattered most was the story of daphne and simon not to forget the many detailed but still erotic sex scenes his grave oath the identity of the mysterious well informed and sharptongued lady whistledown all the confusions of unrequited or improper love all heading towards the brillant finale with its well deserved happy endings needless to say that i wasnt reading any more and tears were shed not only on her side of the sofaoverall i have to say that i got hooked by this brillant modern colorful intoxicating well written series and its ending felt like a good friend leaving also it continued to have an effect especially as i noticed the many poor reviews here blaming it for a lack of historical correctness well as historical correctness quite sure was not the main objective of the series rather than taking some artistic liberties to tell a compelling story i suppose the criticism is a different way of saying they dont like the diverse cast for my part i can say that as written i also found it irritating at the beginning but i love that in the end i did not notice it anymore  and i found the thought wonderful that this might one day be the case in the real world well a long way to go but this series besides all the wonderful moments it gave to me also made some steps in that direction thank you
the first season is pretty good the broody and mysterious duke giving off some nice mr darcyrochester vibes making the romance between he and the innocent debutante feel dangerous and intriguing his reasons for being a jerk are pretty lame but at least they pose a mystery that creates some genuine tensionthe second season awful main plot the two leads have misguided senses of duty and the entire conflict is just them insisting that they have to conform to those imaginary constraints while people around them tell them thats stupid which it is because their duties arent socially binding its not enough conflict to hold together eight episodes and after awhile its just annoying to watch them selfsabotage over such small potatoes surely society was constraining enough back then that they could have come up with something with a little more jazz
"this is not aimed at middle aged men with no open mind this may not be an exact replica of the books but it is a great watch with beautiful costume design solid acting from accomplished experienced actors and new actors coming into the spotlight
people need to lighten up i personally found it a very easy watch and it has obviously appealed to many hence the higher overall score out of  i have not spoken to anyone who has not enjoyed it it is great to see netflix again explore diversity in its casting yet again it is a shame that the word woke is banded about so freely but it just means that the people using it are not open to change
some of the previous reviewers seem utterly stuck in their thinking that because this is a period drama there should be no diversity books and stories can be open for interpretation can be adapted can include a multitude of different actors new experienced different ethnicities different shapes sizes and ages open your minds people
on that note if you are looking for something visually beautiful easy to watch with solid acting then give it a try"
beautiful costumes interesting plot its not on history channel guys this is a show for entertainment whats with all the hate i loved it and cant wait for another season the whole show was very beautiful and satisfying to watch give it a chance  sit back and relax
how does this have a  rating but looking at the reviews  of people reviewing have given it  or  stars a scathing reviews something smells there is no way this series should have a rating that high based on peoples actual comments that it is dribble
"critics got way too worked up over this series first of all consider the source
its netflix not masterpiece theater it is a romp not a tutorial enjoy it for what it is a harmless filler for covid boredom note the color coordination of the housing facades the livery and the gowns of the competing familiesthe exaggerated wigs of the debutantesat one point even the most amazing afro it caricatured period drama jane austin the regencys fashions and moresand accomplished that with a most beautiful and raceless cast how refreshing"
amazing netflix series totally in love with itlike many other reviewers i simply dont understand some of the poor ratings for this series it was an incredible production with an excellent cast  beautifully shot with stunning music
people in these reviews here should calm down no this series is not historically accurate at all and it wont win any awards for writing or acting but it is a refreshing american take on a soapy costume drama with teenage girls as the target audience prepare for classical interpretations of modern songs of artists like ariane grande and billie eilish over the top costumes and styling and a very ethnically diverse cast as is to be expected from netflix and in this time ive only seen  minutes of it and know its not for me but it looks beautiful and im sure teenagers can have fun watching it they might even feel empowered by finally seeing people of color in high positions in a classical costume drama manage your expectations and give it a try
i binge watched the show in a day and then crashed into youtube too see multifandom about the characters some commented that creators should stick to the original characters appearances however i have to say that seeing people dont judge by their skins color made me so happy first in the great then  bridgeton keep making these true pieces of art moreover i cant explain how i loved the chemistry between daphne and simon costumes decorations casting all wonderful i cant wait to see second season
"well personally i wanted to see more of eloise character loved her attitude and development
the rest where mostly like a cinderella movie
a love story with a predictable happy ending
beautifully designed costumesamazing music nice  atmosphere and well arranged diversity
entertaining show"
the first episode is a little slow and i was a little confused but once you get all the characters straight its actually pretty good no its not historically accurate but i didnt tune in because its a period piece i read that it was basically the s london version of gossip girl which i thought was a pretty accurate description all the characters are pretty likeable definitely keeps you entertained and the episodes usually end in a cliffhanger that make binging pretty easy
there are a lot of aspects of this period drama to be criticized but im here to make a shallow comment on the lead actress ive loved much worse quality period dramas if actors brought the emotions to me but this daphne girlshes like a formless white piece of canvas  she looks like twelve and its so awkward to watch her live an adult life
season  felt slightly less cringe but also less raunchy for those that are watching for that factorgetting used to the casting and appreciate it better without the often wooden facial expressions or rjphave to keep reminding myself that its based on a romance novel and appreciate it for what it is  and not keep getting distracted by dresses which appear to have zips behaviour which wouldnt occur in that era and all the character depth of a shallow dish of wateri enjoyably binged both seasons nonetheless and found less reason to cringe in season 
"i was afraid to watch another netflix series without having prejudices but since i have nothing exciting to watch i decided to do so and with great surprise this tv show is refreshing magnificent i even watched it twice
the music is amazing the love scenes too
a must watch"
as a lover of the books i was so ready to see the family i have fallen in love with come to life is it exactly like the books no but as an avid reader that has watched many adaptations this did not disappoint while there are variations from the book they are great ones i follow the author on social media so i knew going in she loved it so i went into it with an open mind i cant get over how much i loved it the colors are beautiful actors are not exactly as i picture them but as i continued to watch i felt they fit better than i had imagined i was also worried how they would handle putting  books into a series because i know it will more than likely not last  seasons they included bits from the other books beautifully to satisfy this reader and those new to it to keep them interested i cant tell you enough how amazing this was thank you ms quinn for allowing your books to come to life i hope many people are happy too so that we may see the rest of the books come to life
watched the st episode a couple of nights ago and couldnt believe how bad it was dreadful acting no proper storyline absolutely terrible like a fluffy pink american attempt at drama someone put it in the same bracket as poldark  to mention it in the same sentence is an insult thats an hour of my life i will never get back again
lets suppose that this historical mess is due to a moment of fantasy of its creators as ridiculous as the queen and her wigsdo not forget that people of the dark race did not inhabit the palace but in the form of servants and that thousands of hindu people succumbed to the british conquest and that while our ghost writer was taking her gossip to print vast numbers of poor people were dying from the filth and coal in the london suburbs too bad the british did not inherit the old french custom of the guillotinebut then that was long long ago was it 
i love this a true romance novel come to lifeit has everything
first off question for those complaining about historical accuracy over a purely fictional story black aristocrats are an inaccuracy but string quartet covers of ariana grande and taylor are historically spot on give us a break from your racism and pettinessas for the show i find myself not liking shondas work more often than not but ive managed to willingly sit through this one because it is a time period im most interested in pride  prejudice is one of my alltime favorite movies i appreciate the elements that give the show a slightly modern twist for a period that is usually portrayed as completely modest and proper the setting is visually beautiful and its refreshing to see a diverse and eclectic cast reminds me of brandys cinderella the plot is standard yet i enjoy these little matchmakingsuitor storylines and im interested in seeing more of the show
it is so refreshing to see characters and not colour follow the storyline and not reflect on history but escape our realities for a seasonbridgerton is a what if fantasy adaptation of an era gone by where the ton set the standard for respectability acceptability societal mores and rules of engagementwhat if prince harry and megan markel were born over  years before their time and harry was in direct line for the throne then slavery in the west indies would have ended a lot sooner and not even been considered in the american colonies what we would have is a society filled with rich colourful characters that should be toldafter all we are only limited by our own imagination
if you like romance read the book series which are phenomenal the series captured maybe a quarter of the charm and humour and the characters are less likeable i still enjoyed it but if i want to relive daphne and simons story ill pick up the books instead next time
idk why people are upset that the show is not the exact same as the books thats kind of the point of adaptation the creative liberties from what i have observed were great the show is bright the story lines are not difficult to follow and you really do feel immersed in this worldi think at times some things were a little annoying but overall i would say the show is pretty good also if youre mad that the cast is diversejust dont watch the show i found that part to be especially cool since looking back at history would tell a different story we can kind of imagine a world where all people are treated similar are able to have similar ranks and basque in their individuality i mean seriously just look at allllll the different hair styles and textures its really beautifulgood job shondaland
i cant believe all the self righteous reviews this isnt a historical documentary it is a lite romantic comedy and should be reviewed that way it has its fun moments and its melodramatic moments but it is not historically accurate who cares it is fun
they discriminated the chinese in that era there were many chinese dukes but the series show nonefor true diversity they should include every race maybe some american indians should be also included
not one to normally write a review but i have to say i loved this show i normally watch things like tvd criminal minds and veronica marsthis caught me off guard and did not think i would enjoy but couldnt stop watching
not understanding the hate at all i thought this was a very good show to watch on a sunday evening it has a good mix of drama romance and thrill i loved seeing daphne and simons relationship grow throughout the series while also seeing the other characters unfold its a perfect historical drama people should not be so focused on the historical details and rather enjoy the series for what it is its worth the watch if u like intense romance and drama
should have made it more realistic for the place and time period but once again hollywood has to impose their social justice narrative i started to watch it and quickly realized how unrealistic it was and what netflix was once again doing with their racial obsession how about we remake roots and porgy snd bess with all white actors
the only thing enjoyable is the set and costume design incredibly boring and predicable plot i guess the high ratings come because we are mainly forced at home and people want to escape and dream amazed its actually making season 
"i understand the negative reviews for this show because historically speaking it is inaccurate but that does not mean it is not very entertaining
you should see this as een alternate reality
the show takes place in the regency era
in that time how awful it may be there were no people of colour who were queens dukes lords and ladies
although its not really how things went down in this era it sure is a lot of fun to see things in a different perspective
i loved seeing people of colour in this show without them being the help
i also loved how the show used very recent songs by artists such as billie eilish and ariana grande in a classic style to fit the era
if you love shows like gossip girl but youre also into costume dramas please do watch this cause it really is a lot of fun
the acting is great the costumes are wonderful and the storyline although being a little predictable is very exciting"
"this will not appeal to the average viewer of historical drama this series is playing with culture and our assumptions about culture rather than portraying an accurate historical version of the timethe acting was fine especially much of the supporting cast the story a bit predictable and while some of the script was nicely written in other parts it was cringeworthyminor spoilers ahead
im a fan of alternative history storiesthey make me think and question my assumptions im speaking of the queen wife to king george being a poc and the the possibilities this opens up for other pocs not that this was the focus of the story it formed the background and was mostly taken for granted rather than discussed other anachronisms included women being assertive lots of modernstyle swearing and modernhollywoodstyle sex both in quality and quantity"
"i never thought the books could be adapted to a tv series but i was wrong the series is as romantic and sexy as the books and no its not historically correct but for all the critics  the show is based on historical romance novels which are set in the regency era but are not historically accurate at all themselves they are pure fantasy so i think the series did a very good job
first i was surprised to see simon played by a nonwhite actor but he was totally convincing and super hot  i just wished they had focussed more on his stammering problem which did play a big role in the book
i am very much looking forward to the next season and anthonys story"
if you are expecting a straightforward period drama bridgerton essentially pride  prejudice caught with its bloomers down may be a bit of a shock bridgerton isnt awful its very addictive and is essentially an historical soap opera with decent acting and a big budget much has been made of the fact that its set in an alternate version of the regency period in which slavery was abolished earlier than it actually was allowing for a much more diverse ruling class however this is never really referenced within the plot and remains entirely superficial we live in a time where people dont really question the authenticity of what is presented to them in historical dramas i can imagine that there will be many people who will view bridgerton and not realise that they are watching an alternative history and will believe that regency period society was more racially egalitarian than it actually was the ugly history of slavery is still not taught in many schools and remains the shameful secret that we find more comfortable to brush under the carpet we cant change history but we can at least have an honest discourse about it historical dramas are not a one stop shop they are great jumping off points to start learning about history but you still have to do research if you want the truth whilst i dont imagine the makers of bridgerton were ever intending to create a serious historical drama there remains the possibility that a great many viewers will not go on to scratch the surface of this period of british history its good to see a diverse cast but i cant help wondering if there will ever be tv dramas and films made to tell the actual histories of poc in britain histories that have been sidelined for too long poc have lived in britain for  years since the days of the roman empire emperor severus who was more important in the history of hadrians wall than hadrian himself was not white a fact that was at best overlooked by many for a long time the film belle  told one such story that of dido elizabeth belle a woman who might easily have been lost to history so many true stories are being left untold bridgerton is a lot of fun it looks beautiful and is very addictivebut dont for one moment think this is how the past really was once youve binge watched it and you will switch off netflix and read a book about the history of the period for an accurate view of how the regency period really treated poc
this show is well made nice costumes good actors it deserves at least  stars or more love the soundtrack as well some people are just haters for no reason
a show im fully engaged in though it doesnt have the refinement of a good classical show like pbs its more adolescent colorful and flashy than that which is its true intentions its not trying to be something else its definitely there to appease the younger crowd with its musical numbers that are clearly classical renditions of pop garb playing in the background as if trying to be clever it can be a little distracting and corny but you accept it its as though they have made a sort of jane austenes que show for the new social media ticktock crazed generation and their short attention span the show is geared on keeping them reeled in and does not get bogged down in any logistics boring dialogue or long moments historically accurate i dont know nor do i want to open that box but it certainly is a nice refreshing take everyone gets to be included and thats such a wonderful change especially in movies and shows like this  my only complaint is the hesitant dialogue that the characters have i get the feeling that they dont know what they are really saying when theyre saying it theyre not really listening to what theyre saying but more or less reading lines all while trying to sound very proper maybe a little too proper lol it comes off as if theyre mocking the character sometimes its as if they are saying their lines for the first time and there is this strange hesitance and confusion to the dialogue i wish i didnt think so but if you pay attention you can see it sometimes i dont believe that the characters even believe what they are saying very script read as though they are reading que cards out of the corner of their eye it could almost pass for bad acting its teetering on that line but i have to give it  stars for keeping my attention and keeping me entertained its pretty to look at also there just doesnt seem to be anything else on tv in this covid year we are in ill put it to you like this the show is like choosing a trashy romance novel over something written by edith wharton sometimes you dont want to have to think that hard you just need something spoon fed to you and whats being spoonfed to you is definitely prepackaged not authentic or homemade but good all the same its a guilty pleasure its hokey but like watching reality tv you dont want to admityou still enjoy it its a show that probably wont get lots of criticism because who cares just watch it and enjoy it
honestly its not that bad after a few glasses of wine i enjoyed watching a period piece with a racially diverse cast however if youre going to get rid of racism why not also get rid of misogyny bigotry and classism
just binge watched season  over the weekend shondaland does it again this series is definitely one of the more surprising ones to me i literally clicked on it because i had no clue what to watch and wanted something to melt my brain to but i was captivated insteadto be sure season  is better there is better writing better character development the story is fresh even though if youve read one romance novel youve read them all season  manages to be beyond that it meets your expectations but it exceeds them as wellseason  is a little less well written by comparison certain situations appear drawn out there are several missed moments when characters could experience pivots in their approach to things their pigheadedness notwithstanding some events end up being sprung on us even though the build up to them was so long and tedious some stories end up not being told im looking at you penelope and some characters are down right out of character for shame eloise i suppose the writers wanted to leave something to tell during season on certain situations being drawn out for no good reason  the long glances the internal turmoil between emotion and duty  we get it already it makes sense for about twothirds of the show then it becomes just arduous and painful to watch we expect certain characters to get together from the start we just want to be taken on a fun journey observing how they get there no need to complicate things artificially take anthonys journey to the realization whom he really loves and indeed the fact he loves someone at all there were at least two moments in the show where he could have made the transition to understanding and it wouldnt have seemed forced also the queens role could have been better developed here as it is it seems almost like an afterthought some potential wastedon certain events being sprung on us after an inordinate amount of time building them up  well the ending really as i mentioned earlier we know what happens in a sense we expect things to end a certain way but we want a nice story that makes sense without any shortcuts or plot twists that really dont make sense the queen suddenly being so open minded tied up loose ends yes but it wasnt a great script maneuveron some stories not being told  lady whistledown gets her story but not penelope miss calper who seems to down on her luck yet again some characters are down right gone i understand space must be made for new ones but lets not dismiss the original ones quite so soon other characters are afforded so little meaningful attention that they go and do stupid things which brings me to my next subjecton certain characters being out of character  i had trouble making up my mind about anthony at some point its not fun to follow a characters development only to begin suspecting him of actually being a scoundrel judging by his actions and decisions however all this is nothing compared to the terrible development of eloisei understand eloise is meant to be a force for change and progress on the show i dont know whether its on purpose or not but they way she has been written in season  represents everything weve learned to hate about feminism  which is i suspect what eloise is meant to espouse she is however so inconsistent childish and obnoxious in her ways i cannot possibly root for her not after the way she treats her best friend in the end youd think eloise would be grateful if indeed all of her disdain for the ton is real her actions in the season finale seriously make me wonder she is indeed all bark and no bite ironically it is the softspoken entrepreneurial penelope that is the true feminist aroundin case this was done on purpose i cant wait to see how the writers rehabilitate eloise in the next season guess well just have to wait and see it might also be interesting to do a season from the servants perspective take a page from downton abbey so to speak
thoroughly enjoyed it despite the deviations from the book which include the new characters a contemporary twist to ensure a diversely inclusive perspective though not reflective of the victorian era the music and certain plot lines ie marina storylines brought forward from other books in julia quinns bridgeton series allows the audience to get to know the characters better wonderful sets and loved the energy of the actors who did justice to their characters as in the books however didnt really enjoy the queens character a bit of a nuisance i do hope the next seasons are made more in keeping with the original story lines of the authoreg would love to see kate and also benedict and sophie stories etc well done though it is after all fiction and thus should be regarded as suchand the books are definitely worth a read if ones like this genre
if bridgerton were set in the far future on a different planet or in an alternate universe it would make more sense sadly it is none of those yet still manages to entertain using sex and gossip as a foundation for poor writing however there is some excellent acting in places but inconsistent accents aboundindulge but know bridgerton is at its base a farce
"its a tv show based on a fictional romance book series sorry to those of you so determined to keep period pieces strictly for white people 🙄 i enjoyed the blind casting and felt they did it well if they can do it why cant most other tv shows out there
and for the supposed black people upset about the blind casting keep sucking up to master its a fictional character who cares what skin tone plays it"
why those songs horrible dont suit at all dont they even have to pay for them useing an fifty shades resemblance not an smart move to use someone who already excistbut actors other hand were decenteasily can watch this not painfuldont know how they managed to get allmost hour long episode would have guessed like thirty minutes
one of the best new shows to come out of  full of humour intrigue and of course romance cant wait to hear about a s
"i love the books im reasonably happy with the show but  why the heck is there so much smoking to relax frankly it throws me so much out of the scene that i scarcely know what eloise is saying honestly the time for cigarettes has come and gone these are barely disguised im probably the only person who doesnt think smoking is cool nor do i find it at all sexy or interesting
some of the casting choices probably piss folks off but im ok with such changes"
loved everything about it it was serious it was funny it was delicious everything you could want
i was really excited about this show but it missed the mark for me i have read the book series numerous times and always loved the family dynamic and witty banter between the characters that julia quinn created but the adapted script made all the characters real stiff serious and unpersonable where they mostly stuck to the overall storyline of the first book the duke i they pulled certain sub plots from future books in the series to early changed them or gave them way to much run time the adding of the opera singervery briefly from book  and marina thompson important to eloises story in book  originally a bridgerton cousin that were barely mentioned till later books and having them as main characters  made anthony and colin unlikable for their future seasons adding the dressmaker mr feathertonand prince friedrich who are not in the books at all were totally pointless and gave no real substance to the story at all changing ms danberrys role as a funny gossip to queen charlotte anther character barely included in the books was also a let down as she is featured throughout all the books and a very influential to the younger bridgertons stories and the search for lady whistledown i hope for future seasons they stick more to the books storyline and not change it to include modern problems that contradict the time period and also bring more of the humor back to the writing and less of the non important sex scenes and unnecessary added side characters
i can get over the fact that the island of britain suddenly has so many different races in it was almost unheard of for people to move country and only the very wealthy travelled they certainly would not have been included in the london circuits unless they were royalty what i cant forgive is the woeful lack of research done for the period the language used is clearly a very poor american version of regency english the female undergarments were a mishmash of several eras and the outer garments of both sexes a fanciful version of the era what made me decide to throw in the towel with this series though was the duke being in the birthing room with the duchess and a male doctor never it would never have happened there would have been a midwife and housemaids present the husband would not have been anywhere near the birth and nor would he have wanted to be a man seeing a womans most intimate areas would have been totally forbidden particularly in the upper classes i just wish the americans would leave our british history alone if they arent prepared to do the research oh and another thing what the hell with the music and dancing its nonsense and the only reason to watch is the raging sex and nudity now that i firmly believe happened although not quite so blatantly
overall i really enjoyed the series the characters were interesting and all the scenes with the siblings were funny and realistic episode  was very problematic and i wish they didnt include it also the lgbt rep was pretty lousy laughable even
this show is charming they managed to address current issues even though everything happened in the th century the cast is impeccable and managed to clearly convey the essence of each character the main couple daphne and simon passed a magical connection through the eyes and this makes any heart beating stronger long episodes however flow so quickly that they are not tiring all my satisfaction for this show
a lot can be done with ones life during the horrible long and boring time that bridgerton series require to disappointthat is allthe following words are here just to reach the  characters target needed for this review to be posted so please dont consider anything written belowbla bla bla bla bla bla
the pace is too fast silly and somewhat comedic to me i felt like i was watching a a mashup of all things that define shonda rhimes tv showsit has jokes steamy sex scenes passion but the thing that struck me the most was the pace of the story it was much too fast for me i felt like the story had been rushed to the er at grey sloan memoriali was really hoping for something more realistic with a story that would capture you and keep you watching im halfway through the first episode and feeling completely lost it did not feel like a period piece but rather like a satire of onei am a huge fan of the regency era and usually watch anything that is remotely similar in nature but i could not sit through this one i am not even tempted to go try to figure out who is who and finish that first episodemaybe when i feel like having a laugh at the era i will try again
"if you loved gossip girl you will love this show it has gossip romance a few racy scenes and the duke of hastings who is lets say easy on the eye
if you want to switch of from what is happening to you around the world because youre sick of hearing about the virus and throw yourself back into a time where no one social distanced and the only mask that would of been worn would of been for a masquerade ball then this show should be at the top of your listthe comments below are not to be believed i could not stop watching this and had to get to the next episode everyone is talking about lady whistledown who is she i would spoil this and will let you all form your own opinion of who she can be you wont be disappointed you will either be hooked in the first  minutes like i was or this show is not for you"
i feel this is a decent series but maybe not an excellent one i never felt that this series intended to be historically accurate so that part didnt bother me it started out a little slow but i did grow to like the characters the storyline is sometimes a little far fetched but entertaining if youre looking for a show that you can analyze and think deeply about this is not the show for you if youre looking for something fun and a little different check it out
yes this is the gossip girl for  to have such a brazen show with dame julie andrews the amazing narrator of this depiction of regency era london in society season is absolutely brilliant i love how the elements of wendy darling jane austen much ado cinderella and the modern aspects of gg have been molded into this brilliant fictional historical dramady the actors writers and directors work together in a perfect trifecta in an effervescent bubble of costumes and scenery a diamond of a show
"i found it quite hard to connect to this show something about the writing or the characters im not sure maybe it was a bit too americanised
it looks like its had all the money in the world thrown at it but yet still somehow looks cheap
jonathan bailey is always good in stuff hes in hes definitely the best thing in this"
i want more 😊 it has the drama the roman e and a great storytelling good actors too i hope for at least a second season
i agree with whoever said this is fun to watch with a glass of wine it isnt riveting drama the characters janeaustenesque miscommunications that end happily are often more frustrating than understandable the main couple lack real depth as individuals particularly daphne rene jeanpage is one to watch and his acting surpasses hers he gives it his all but his character as written is kind of a disney regency romantic hero with sex there is always sexthat said its still very engaging the costumes and sets are to die for i mean daphnes dresses are cracking and seemingly endless most of the actors turn in fun performances i particularly like claudia jessie sp as the bookworm sister and the actress who plays penelope the queen and the lady who orchestrates everything forgot her name lady something everyone is beautiful and did i mention the costumes the lady whistledown conceitmystery works well enough and its delightful to hear julie andrews voicing herif they are going to do more seasons focusing on the other siblings which it seems they will given the success of the show then the writers will really have to up their game with the male characters i dont really blame the actors but the bridgerton brothers are not wellsketched and i dont particularly care about the happiness of any of them anthony is very handsome and has potential but he acted like a dumb jerk for the first half of the season colin seems like a goofball i do like the two youngest kids though theyre adorbsas for the diversity of the cast i like it this is not a historical drama its a romance set in a liberally altered historical era its a quasifantasy and should be viewed as such if you want them to get the skin color and soup spoons perfect watch downton abbey that wasnt particularly realistic either when you get down to it but people act like it was shakespeare or something come on
side characters trump over the main leads in bridgerton season to say jonathan bailey was robbed could be understatement bridgerton season  is based on the book viscount who loved me where anthony played by jonathan bailey takes the lead but unfortunately the screenplay did the opposite with his character in the new season he had more presence in season  than what he got in s instead too many unnecessary characters occupied the screen giving anthony and kate less importance in the whole  episodes it was like the show is about the featheringtons anthony and kate are just fillerssometimes the adaptations are done with a twist to keep the audiences on their toes so that they can connect with the book but at the same time anticipating is there gonna be a twist but this story got twisted so badly was like watching an indian soap opera i dont mind the blunder of history as this is a fantasy show but destroying the main characters like they did here i do mind as i said jonathan had more passion and presence in s than s he couldnt do justice to his lead role because of the poor screenplay instead luke thompson stole the show every time he was on screen along with claudia ashley did amazing with what she was given and she did somewhat do justice to kate but my biggest disappointment was the character edwina the cast was so bang on but the character just out of an indian soap the edwina of the book was totally erased and rewritten as a whiny needy girl who just wanted to be the viscountess not the girl who wanted to marry a scholar and marry for love here out of nowhere she fell in love with anthony and determined to get married to him the love triangle was sooooooo unnecessarythese  were supposed to be the stars of s instead u gonna find they are the after thoughts cause somehow the writers thought showing the stories of featheringtons the queen will and his gentlemen club are more important than building the love story of anthony and kate  episodes they had  episodes to build the story but such missed opportunitythe on screen chemistry between jonathan and ashley is sizzling but audiences were also robbed from those cause there wasnt a lot of those steamy scenes in s like s when it was promised to audience that this season gonna be more bold and daring and scandalous but it wasnt still the little screen time they got for showing chemistry both jonathan and ashley nailed the longing for each other beautifullybut my disappointment still remains cause out of all the bridgertons i loved the story of anthony and kate story of two strong willed people and how they fell in love despite anthony being idiotic in some parts the writers director took the lovely story and managed to destroy it with their creativity so people a fair warning do not expect anything similar as the book other than the names and those who thought gonna see some couple actions like daphne and simon forget about it instead be prepared to see featherington instead of bridgerton
i dont get why some people hate this show its well written top level production and great actingthe top complaints i see are that the dialogue is bad that it doesnt represent the age it is set in and that it has too much dramabad dialogue i think some people arent used to big words and people not saying cuss words all the timeera inaccuracies do some people not realize its a dramatization of a fictional story its called taking liberties plus come on its a british themed showed produced for americans its tailored that way for a reason i love the instrumental versions of modern songstoo much drama it is a drama from the creator of greys anatomyi think people cant enjoy it for what it is and that makes no sense
after accepting the black aristocracy and that show even doesnt try to reflect the reality of th century i think this series was really fun and entertaining story flow was really good not to mention the beautiful set and a dressing eight episodes went through in a jiffy leaving you to want more yes i will definitely wait for season  to come
amazin how it looks like reading the books so much loved
its an interesting fantasy world the writer concocted set in england in  racism doesnt seem to exist but sexism misogyny and even fat phobia are out in full force it would have been nice to eliminate other elements of the patriarchy like womens lack of agency and autonomy lack of life or career choices unrealistic beauty standards child brides for old men etc that caused women such extreme suffering back then and still persist today a complete gender role reversal would have been amazingly fun to watchthis show was somewhat easy to watch if you enjoy period pieces gorgeous costumes and settings in nearly every scene however it seemed utterly incomplete to play with race while still upholding the majority of patriarchal standards its tiresome to continue to glorify misogyny on television
absolutely loved watching this the costumes the acting the story i have never read the book but i do like the story very much that is being told its never boring as it switches between storylines and gives you multiple characters to pay attention to i hope they come out with season 
"bridgerton  series my rating 
gentle reader to quote lady whistledown
 you missed the most remarkable coup of the season and that would have been to have maintained the same standard script wise as season one but in this season for me the icing on the cake was still delicious but the cake was staleafter initial misgivings i enjoyed season one of this bizarre colourblind casting confection set in the th century regency era and gave it a however for me the novelty of the lavish sets colourful costumes and bizarre character casting this time wore off quicklyone reason is the absence of handsome regéjean page as simon basset the duke of hastings in this series he is nowhere to be found revealing in an interview with variety he said that he knew his time on bridgerton was going to be shortlived because he only had a oneseason dealthe other reason i got bored in this season was the lack of story line  the plot mainly evolves around the love triangle of anthony bridgerton and the sharma sisters kate and edwina and apart from the late get rich scheme of lady portia featherington to gain her lost fortune back it just doesnt go anywhere while jonathan bailey is handsome as anthony bridgetown hes nowhere near as dynamic as regéjean page and the quest for lord anthony bridgerton to choose a suitable wife which begins in the first episode gets tired after  episodessimone ashley is lovely as kate sharma sister of edwina sharma played by charithra chandran edwina is the diamond debutant chosen by queen charlotte played with delicious disdain by golda rosheuvelher scenes especially with the equally regal lady danbury played by adjoa andohmake are the most delightful part of bridgerton for mei know  million viewers switch on to this very successful series but do those  million stay with it  you only have to click on once to netflix to be a viewing statisticill look forward to series  to see if theres an improvement and if i was the script writer i would be exploring the marriage of queen charlotte and king george rd more as the few scenes in this series featuring james fleet as the king were interesting and could be an entertaining addition to the story"
i really enjoyed this series it was very special and different from a lot of other shows on netflix which i really liked i dont understand the people who are writing that they are bad actors i think the opposite also the series is fiction so why are people mad that the time is not historical correct it doesnt have to be i would definitely recommend this series if you are looking for something new and interesting
daphne is cute but not the beauty she should be she would not bring everything to a stop when she entered a room
this series is amazing my expectations were high but they surprised me even more the actors showed us in a perfect way how the characters felt and everything was similar to the books regé was the best simon i couldve imagine simply perfect
"vinerika your comment about jane austin is ignorant  ridiculous she didnt write this julia quinn did
its a refreshing modern take on a period drama  mixing purposely black  white people for effect which works really well
this is easily a  out of  its well acted by all  good romance  good story intriguing and quite raunchy in places
i enjoyed it so bloody there"
in addition to the miscast cast that is honestly so unrealistic the series doesnt follow the book even in minimal details the series doesnt follow the books on basically anything its just another netflix bait nothing new under the sun and acting is terrible
i have completed  episodes and think this show is delightful i came here to see the reviews and am completely gobsmacked to see how many people are twisted up about historical inaccuracy and reducing the great casting of this show as merely an attempt to be pc i am fairly certain this is a fictional story line and the beauty of fiction is the freedoms that it can allow how wonderful to see a genre i love so much set in a wonderful place where no one bats an eyelash at race there is intrigue chemistry humor and conflict all set in a beautiful place with magnificent costumes it is escapism it is pure entertainment shed your stuffy dated expectations and exclusivity and take a breath of fresh air i cannot wait to finish this
thats it just perfect watch it ive seen it all at once on netflix the books are quite good too but you dont have to read it to watch the show
season  is way much better than season  in my opinionthe chemistry between the kate and anthony was just somethingthe connection between the family was so real
at first it looked intriguing but i was forced to skip many scenes cause it got cringeworthy at some point however its not terrible you can watch it if youre bored and looking to kill some time
i have seen the first episode and while it did present a few false notes overall it was quite good indeed i think the false notes were likely due almost purely to my own limitations regarding race the series challenges viewers to disabuse themselves of the modern meaning of race and become absorbed with the interior lives of the characters it is not like hamilton which merely presses modern urban culture upon the american revolutionary era bridgerton leaves the feel of the regency era intact but simply invites viewers to throw away the shackles of race and enjoy the drama skin colour here becomes as meaningless as hair and eye colourif you find yourself cringing consider looking inward rather than condemning the series i discovered that when i assumed the insignificance of race as the series does i began to see mere humans with dark skin negotiating relationships with browneyed or lightskinned humans and humans with blond or dark hair once i went out of my way to assault and then kill the meaning of race a new and marvelously fresh experience emerged
this alternative historyseries is a treat for anyone who likes to get pulled into a good and inspiring story the acting is exquisitely good i especially liked nicola coughlans and claudia jessies performances all characters are really brought to life quite well and their character arches are welldeveloped i highly recommend diving into this alternative dimension
my goodness so many horrible angry reviews yes the show can be a bit overthetop and frivolous but its also charming light and fun does anyone remember fun must every show be edgy gritty and dark bridgerton is much like an enjoyable summer read it is escapism at its best and most enjoyable when it is most needed and still touches on life love and family moments we have all been through i suggest that if you do not have a sense of humor as so many seem to have lost this show is not for you try peaky blinders perhaps
entertaining love story well written and acted with visually excellent sets and costumes those wigs delicious delightful emotional and sometimes funny very enjoyable
"if you are looking for historical accuracy this isnt for you
if you are looking for a show with gorgeous costumes sets and a damn sexy leading man who happens to be blackthis is a dream come true the casting truly feels like right actor dont care what their race is
the actors are perfectly cast the chemistry between simon and daphne is strong and the humor just right wonderful adaptationfaq
yes they explain why black people are in positions of power no they do not focus on race truly it is only mentioned x maybe twice and never any talk about biracial couples in this world people are just peopleyes there is sex a lot of it dont watch with your mom if you arent comfortable seeing sex sceneslots of naked male butts some boobs thrusting and seeing a man go down on a woman its intense for like min montage and a little bit at the start of episode yes there are major changes from the book they dont lose any of the important pieces and the changes make sense for a tv show new characters help move the plot forward and new story lines flesh out the siblings we didnt get to know in book  approach this show like a fans retelling of the story and you can enjoy itcant wait for season "
i dont have a problem with the cast diversity hamilton i wish they would have used the music of that period as it would have introduced music that many of the viewers have not heard before instead of bad arrangements of mediocre popular songs i just watched the first episode its ok the acting seems forced and not really believable but the costuming and sets are pleasant to look at the plot is somewhat intriguing and the fact that julie andrews is the narrator will probably keep me watching this
frothy american soap fantasy with curious cultural misappropriations  i got through half of episode one before deciding life was too short and precious
i binged it one sitting i loved how the characters interacted with each other i loved the costumes and i thought daphne and her simon had a great on screen chemistry
finally we have a historical romance series which doesnt shy away from showing steamy and passionate scenes this adaptation of julia quinns acclaimed bridgerton books is so much more than i had hoped it would be the colours the costumes the music the set design is vibrant and fairy tale like this has drama romance gossip and well written characters that a romance lover will surely enjoy cant wait for s
i have not read the books thus i had no expectations i just finished the series and went through the comments why so much hate because the books were better so what i must admit that i have observed many fallacies and mistakes concerning the time period characters etc but i found the episodes very entertaining i found the chemistry between the  main characters incredible and this was the main reason i liked the show get over yourselves people and judge based on the shows actual value not the closeness to the books
kind of like a mashup of gossip girl  pride and prejudice with some of the trashiness of fifty shades also follows the formula of girl meets perfect boy with a problem girl wants to fix problem in this case its girl desperately and forcibly fixes the problemi couldnt get into it the first time i tried but gave it a go again after my brain was fried from doing taxes ended up enjoying it mostly because of the actors great chemistry also the duke page is some serious eye candy and god knows im thirsty after almost a year of this dang pandemic yippee
i have now watched this two times in less than a week the characters the story and the actors make the series regejean is superb as simon and his chemistry with daphne is exquisite you pine for them to find their was back to each other you want them to win at love i couldnt wait for the next season so im reading the second book for now you wont be disappointed
a fantastic cast wonderful costumes and production design a lovely score narrated by julie andrews lots of romance and very steamy sex scenes cant wait for future seasons
definitely worth watching great actors and actions love it
when i started this show i thought would be kind of funny to laugh at because i didnt think it would be very good and i was bored so i tried it it was all right i kind of enjoyed it but its really kind of meh there isnt much character development the most character development i saw was from one of the bridgerton brothers anthony overall the show itself is pretty cringy to watch on a more positive note it can be fun sometimes its not the worst show ive ever seen but its also not the best it really reminded me of a harlequin romance book if you dont enjoy shows with a lot of drama and romance you are not gonna enjoy this theres also a lot of nudity that i think is a little unnecessary but overall not bad not great either
i have always enjoyed period pieces but wouldnt it be fun to see one with black people in lead roles for me the answer is yes and bridgerton delivers on that fantasynot to be taken too seriously the series is fun sexy and entertaining it offers eye candy with overthetop wardrobe and wigs in a time when things are challenging and there is quite a bit of negativity on tv its nice to have a fun and colorful escape
it may lack a certain bbc finesse for the purists even aside from the rulebreaking sex scenes yet is very watchable all the same has a valuable take on race  love vs responsibility plus is funny the acting costumes characters writing  sets are all above par so if youre looking for an entertaining period drama this is it
theres no historical accuracy whatsoever im a big fan of aesthetics and its the reason why i gave this show a chance what a disappointment the music classical ariana grande please kill mei havent hated a show before but now i can say that i do its historically so inaccurate that some people that watch this probably start thinking that queen charlotte was really blacki get it  they wanted to make a historical show but a fun one so zoomers can hop on the bandwagon whats the point in choosing a specific time period if youre not going to keep it accurate in any wayif the show had time traveling or something i wouldve rated it soooooo differently now it just left me feeling uncomfortable
the show got very bad reviews but it was actually smooth and fun to watch
absolutely fantastic show for lovers of the books and the new finders through the netflix series julia quinns fantastic and well loved bridgerton series was wonderfully turned to film by the people at shondaland and gave it a new light the brothers and sisters of the bridgerton family tell their stories in a steamy way and you get to see them in a new light best thing thats come out this year
i appreciate the concept but as s period piece it took too long to understand it wasnt sorry
"after downton abbey and the tudors i think i just expected too much until the end i was waiting for something complicated and meaningful no way it is based on a series of softcover books for women which i being myself a woman can read from time to time and gives only that  a romantic story with the simplest plot and very predictable storyline not bad but the wows around it seem for sure exaggerated
i can hardly guess what caused all the excited reviews yes it is beautifully shot yes the actors are pleasant to watch at yes different nationalities are represented just like in everyday life but nothing more than that
i can only thank the authors that they made it only  episodes long where they could make  episodes of this soap opera easily  episodes is an advantage
i think it is better to watch bridgertons without reading all the excited reviews before that and then it can be a light and entertaining pastime however i would not want to watch it again"
the series is good the actors are good and the story was not the same as the book but it remained similar i saw all the episodes in one day it is a romance a fiction it does not need to be faithful to the history of the time it can be represented by actors of all colors simon is perfect lady danbury too they are by the way very similar to their personalities books
i see there are many comments on how liberties have been taken with the depiction of life in those times as well as criticisms of the quality of the dialogue but what offended me was the americanised script one example the use of momentarily instead of in a moment that is not british usagei was surprised too to see simon by the bedside while daphne was giving birth that certainly would not have occurred in those days
"the show is perfect
the caracters the cast every things was made for us with so much care and atention
i loved it
cant wait for the next season"
ive never read the books but i was really enjoying the series as a whole until daphne basically rapes simon in episode  and the remaining episodes obviously have to deal with the fallout ive since found out that something similar happens in the books so its accurate to the text but it really turned me off from the rest of their arc in the series id be interested in watching another season of the show but primarily for the secondary characters in this season i was immediately intrigued by eloise bridgerton benedict bridgerton colin bridgerton and penelope featherington and following episode  these characters along with the sibling relationships and friendships between these characters really carried the series for me
love this show so captivating and entertaining but above all else the costumes are simply out of this world the whole show is such a feast for the eyes
"just binge watched season  and it was really ok but the plot with lord featherington was just boring eloise  penelope were ok
but they should develop benedicts plot better i also thought it was kinda boring
i liked kate and anthonys story he is very delightful to watch and their chemistry was very good"
"its like they switched out the entire production team team from season one the script was different directing was different acting was different which mean casting was different production was different and not different as much as sucked uninspiring and uninteresting if not for having watched season one and loved it i wont have bothered past ep  of season  as it is i missed at least one ep and several scenes from falling asleep but i have zero curiosity to go back and figure out what happenedthe two new leads casted were just blah i was quite disappointed bc i was rooting for them yet i dont blame them i dont know if they werent right for the roles and were miscasted or they were right and misdirected it was simply too obvious the problem
wasnt theirs for example one of the new leads had a wig that clearly didnt fit her the entire show they couldnt even get a decent wig or a hair stylist to make the wig look real what a shamethere were some scenes that im sitting on my heels like wtf is happening this is something at which a director shouldve yelled cut and filmed until reasonable such as when kate fell from the horse she was lying unmoving presumably bc she was knocked unconscious and not that she couldnt get upif she was conscious she would be moving attempting get up if shes physically unable to the effort to get up would still persist but will appear as slight vague
movements and her eyes would be open rightbut she wont be moving at all if she was unconscious then someone tell me why but she had a grimace on her face as a reaction to the falling rain an unconscious person conscious enough to know its raining as the actor she wont know she was doing that bc its a reflex something the body does without thinking the director shouldve been the one to know she was doing it and it doesnt fit into the scene then coached her to relax her face just one of many scenes that seemed to get worse over timeoh the lines were straight up like blah uninteresting and unbefitting of that period you can just tell when then say line it just wont landwaste of time"
what a marvelous show my copies of the bridgerton series are but remnants of the pristine books i picked up nearly a decade ago i applaud how very well done the show is so far and i hope it continues this way or better as an asian american actress it gives me hope to see that hollywood is choosing more bipoc talent for such rolesits time for change change is progressive
"so disappointing to see all of these bad reviews full disclosure i have never read the books but i can understand that some people may get attached to their personal idea of a character however i and perhaps anyone else who has an imagination and loves when modern touches are added to periodic tv showsmovies  ie the knights tale absolutely love it the chemistry between simon and daphne is untouchable their storyline is heartfelt and lovely i love all the characters although some of their storylines are a tad bit boring but i imagine they will get better as the show continues
i urge anyone with an open mind and heart to give this stunning show a chance"
"enjoyable fluff to cheer you up in these troubled times it is reminiscent of jane austin it probably isnt historically accurate but it it is easy to watch it is funny in parts it is gloriously romantic the main characters are very easy on the eye and i have watched it several times in the interest of forming a considered opinion i have read the first few books  the story on screen is mainly true to the authors original
next season please we need more anthony and benedict in our lives"
brilliant costume sets scriptwriting and acting could do without the skin colour speech in episode  id come to terms with it not being historically accurate in the first  minutes  i didnt need an explanation the splendour is just lovely and i really enjoyed immersing myself in this series a good series about love and responsibility
so in love with this show great acting characters costumes and spicy scenes and the music is the perfect touch to this steamy fauxhistorical dramai especially love the diversity among the characters and the rewriting of how history could have been
its good drama romance emotional combination one time watch drama with romance emotional family dramatic condition
"i just loved it
exactly what was needed during lockdown
ignore the negative comments and binge watch it like the other mil viewers did"
as i recently watched the new emma i was struck that jane austen was writing in the midst of a terrible world war in which england was straining all its efforts well obviously these emptyheaded twits werent exerting any effort at all to defeat napoleon and his french legions hundreds of thousands were dying while these folks fretted about good matches and profitable marriages in braidgerton you see a few court uniforms and one absent soldier is referenced but this show looks much more like antebellum versailles than a country just entering the industrial revolution pointless fun not unlike alicia silverstone in clueless only here in the midst of covid does this show make you forget all that did you even realize the historical connection if you want empty calories and empty careless people and downton abbey is too real world enjoy
"i think the intensity of the negative reviews comes from viewers who had read the book as is typical for book loyalists regardless of which adaptation they are simply incapable of a fair review imo
likewise pride and prejudicedownton abbey fans are going to be hard on this show this series was never meant to be historically accurate it was meant to be hyperbole
im a big fan of baz luhrmanns style and this reminded me so much of his movies its a cross between his romeo and juliet or moulin rouge and perhaps sofia coppolas marie antionette
simon is perfectly cast and his intensity and commanding presence set the bar high for the rest eloise is a close second she almost steals the show
ignore the naysayers and give it a chance"
i loved season  i watched it twice but the second season was difficult to watch embarrassing the first season was new romantic and refreshing but now it dreaded on and and on with drama on drama and miscommunication it felt fake i didnt believe the love between kate and anthony everything felt fake with this season i lost my love for the series it was a short one apparently a shame i really loved season  season  decor costumes  overall feeling  acting  storyline  originality  ending  season  decor costumes  overall feeling  acting  storyline  originality  ending 
great casting its pp meets gossip girl if the bennetts were rich and had a baseball team of kidsi loved watching every minute of this and watched it in one sitting the plot intrigues you immediately episodes packed a lot of story in hr its another shonda hit hope theres a season 
thank you for so much representation on top of the main characters
i am a huge fan of the  version of pride and prejudice so i went into this with a bit of trepidationlook past the diversity of colours when it comes to the actors and ignore them and you have a show that very well done we should all look past the colour of skin anyway the world would be a better place if everyone did so there is a lesson in the casting of this show right thereputting all that aside the show is very well done so much so that i binge watched it in one setting not once but twice the third time i took a more leisurely pace with my other halfpride and prejudice it is not but it is close enough that i will be watching it many more times in the future and look forward to another seasonan easy  and well worth multiple viewings
great potential if the two main characters would both get off screen for five minuteseveryone else on the show has a seemingly more interesting story arch waiting to be told
to all the people who are writing reviews based on the races and nationalities of the actorsyou realize that this show is fiction yeah
seems that there are alot of bad reviews regarding historical accuracy of the show once you get over the characters skin color and see them as a human being which we should do there is a romantic series here the show is not a historical piece its a romantic story there is something for everyone here as it is in every production these days to attract maximum viewership there is white black brown asian straight gay femenist masculine skinny fat family friendship and every thing in between dont be offended think of it as a parallel universe the other complain in the reviews is that its not true to the books guess what i didnt know the books existed untill i came here and read the reviews i see the series as a stand alone work i have never read a romantic novel and probably never will however i enjoyed this series it is romantic love story which brought tears to my eyes more than once it is extremely simple and straightforward its colorful there is not much mystery its just simple romantic dialog unfortunately the series loses momentum in the last two episodes of the series and does not finish as strong as it starts its watchable if your are not too picky and willing to just enjoy rather than look for production flaws
not my genre but enjoyed every minute of this show im off to read the other books now sappy romantic passionate as per usual the book readers are here with their pitchforks
in episode  the second waltz is played by the musicians this waltz was composed by shostakovich in 
"the show is amazing and embodied the soul os the books and characters
the casting was amazing the soundtrack classic yet modern the scenery delightful"
"i love watching costume dramas and literary adaptations especially at christmas the period in which this is set is my favourite being a longstanding fan of jane austen but this is very different that said i love the costumes and sets and the insight into regency society
i know a lot of people have issues with the casting of poc and i know it isnt necessarily historically accurate but people need to get over themselves and just enjoy it for what it is the duke is as handsome a leading man as any other literary hero and it shouldnt matter what colour his skin is
i havent read the books so i dont know how accurate it is but its entertaining enough as a friend and fellow costume drama fan put it any costume drama is better than none at all"
this is very bad and unreal the miscast cast spoils any historical immersionthe plot the writing is as deep as a tea saucer the acting is hammy the cinematography is cheapjust another netflix trsh
i read the reviews of the low ratings and the very thing the people are complaining about is what makes bridgerton entertaining and refreshing we have seen downtown abbey and the tudors ten times over omg i cant believe so many people just dont get it i cant believe that so many people are so uptight bridgerton was not intended to be accurate with culture and diversity of people etc etc etc its tv yall need to go pbs or the history channel if your looking an account of history
i have literally just finished the whole of the new netflix tv show release called bridgerton it is heads above alloutstanding season each episode stands on its own brilliantmy favourite netflix show ever
the costume and set designs were really beautiful its a perfect feelgood easywatch series to end the year with some plots were kinda predictable but didnt make the show any less enjoyable living for the diversity of the cast and you could tell they had fun shooting this series
the music is so well done the clothing and the diversity of people but im a little bored just get on with the love story and give us what we want maybe im just impatient but thats the only reason im sticking it out until the end halfway through and im ready for the ending
"i loved the whole of color and scandal that the bridgerton series created i loved the thoughtfulness that was shown in including a cast of multiple races after the positive novelty of a diverse cast seeped in i fell into the world that was created
i cant wait until season  😍"
even though it is not based on the historical facts i liked it it is like an alternate universe everybody in the reviews gave bad rating because of that historical problem we all can agree that it is not the best show ever but it is not worth of  rating too i personally didnt liked it at first but after if you accept the fact the show is pretty good i love shows and film do that era so it attracted me more i liked the acting and the script was not perfect but bearable if you dont have any motives to watch this show ill give you one regé page i liked this show very much and thanks to him it was even better
"such an easy watch
the costumes are amazing
the acting is interesting in parts hastings is simply delightful"
"this series seems like a mix of gossip girl downton abbey and a little bit of pride and prejudice it does however lack the production value of downton abbey and the script of pride and prejudice that being said it is an enjoyable watch and binge worthy the actors and actresses are decent enough and the story  if not new  rather compelling
it started out more or less innocent and became rather hot later in the season which i truly didnt expect but felt quite new to this genre which made it a nice surprise the series is very st century like so dont expect a story characters costumes and the society to be all that accurate it seems they wanted to do a more fictional new take on this era and if it isnt sold as an historically correct show i see no problem in that
all in all it is worth a watch if youre looking for a light romance series dont expect too much from it then i think youll find yourself enjoying this guilty pleasure series"
you should be a fan of the series beautiful and so clever i still dont love daphne but that may because of simon d casting is perfection the story is going in all the right places someone who is a true fan of the books will appreciate this series its gorgeous thank you creators for the bees im just in awe
although the essence of the book is there there are some changes in the story as expected and despite i dont say this often thank god for those changes because otherwise it would have been a very dull tv showif you like regent romances and youre looking for something light not too serious and in a way funny to watch just give it a go and you wont regret itthe only bad thing i have to say is the show failed to capture the humor of the  older bridgertons brothers in the book anthony benedict and specially colin are always teasing each other their mother or sisters they have a mixed sense of irony and humor that i didnt see in the series
i was a fan of the novels julia quinn is renowned for her quickwitted banter  her character  lady danbury  is an especially beloved old curmudgeon who infamously delivers the most rapierlike burns whoever adapted the books for netflix is tragically devoid of any wit whatsoever the writing is awful and so very unfaithful to the novels or even actual history that it is extremely difficult to immerse oneself in this travesty of a universe shonda rhimes has created terrible screenplay and wokelike revisions of history aside i say this as a woman of color fyi some of the actors were absolutely dreadful the amount of overacting we were subjected to by certain characters almost made it seem like they were playing caricatures of quinns originals abominable
these reviews are mixed but i loved the showas a viewer you can really tell how much effort is put into the production hair makeup costumes etc but there is much more than thatit is so interesting to watch a show that is so different from everything else on tv right now the acting is amazing and the show captures what life could have been like with no racismafter binge watching both seasons i can say this is one of my favourite netflix seriesi will continue to watch this show for as long as they will renew it
sorry jason momoa you just got demoted to number two hero fantasy guy and replaced by regejean page this series is perfectly cast unless simon is actually in love with daphne in real life this is some pretty good damn acting because when was the last time a man looked at you like that and made your heart skip a beatfairytales in our society are and always have been for girls and this is a grown up version for women i personally liked that i got to see a lot more of simons body than daphnes thank you shonda appreciate you i have no idea what simon was licking off of that spoon butwait what was i talking aboutokay i had to take a moment now im back for the reviewi actually wanted to give this review eight stars but i had to counter all of those ridiculous one stars that are on this website i took away two points for the quasi rape scene because that was not cool daphne that was a big no no and no buenohowever the costumes and the sets are amazing people can suspend their disbelief for all kinds of historically inaccurate drivel in all types of genres that warn theyre based on inspired events theres an interracial cast so what its sumptuous its beautiful its wonderful to watch and a good time its what movies are meant to beentertaining it has nothing to do with the realities of  only with the imagination of people in  and thats a good thing everything in the world we have started in someones imagination and i personally want an all inclusive futureand a world where aquaman and simon are both married to me just kidding honey you know youre the only man for me  when im awake 😊
i watched the trailer  was taken aback with black people being portrayed in the way they are i understood it to be an historical drama in the downton abbey style having read reviews i realise this is not the case  i can now accept the casting but it does bother me that reviewers of the gilded age complained it was not historically accurate surely that is a double standard its fine to flaunt history in one programme  not another please understand as i do this is television stories not the history channel i will watch this  hope to enjoy the spectacle
im not gonna lie the storyline of bridgerton is very predictable about man who dont want to have a lover but endup marrying a woman and madly in love with her but i do enjoy myself watching this show beside the storyline the historical theme of this show is pretty interesting some people said the costumes are historically mess but for me its fancy thoughthe things that i love from this show  the cast theyre hot they choose the right actor for simon basset  the relationship of bridgerton family especially benedict and eloise im a person who always put family first over everything so i adore them so much even though anthony is kinda annoying  their accents are beautifulif you love easycheesy romance i recommend you to watch this show this show is not that bad
i didnt read the book nor do i enjoy period dramas but damn this was good the chemistry between them is soo damn palpable also the costumes are so wonderful and i just love the casting a wonderfully fun romance
this series is just boring and the storyline doesnt make sense
season  was truly amazing chemistry between kate and anthony was bonkers the enemies to lovers trope was beautifully executed such an amazing season so much better then the  thanks to kates  anthonys actors
"if you want a period drama like the jane austin adaptations turn around and try again this will not be it it will be not be another bbc pride and prejudice there is cleary confusion on what time period this is set in by the makers of this series
leaving all historical inaccuracies aside and there are a fair few this show comes with lots of bad but some good the writing is relatively poor it has its moments where it is ok but sometimes it is very cringey the acting isnt so bad it has quite a few well known names in it so id expect the acting to be relatively decent although at times some of the acting is painful and cringey the story is ok however i feel it was extremely rushed for example the marriage should have been at the end of the series the unveiling of lady whistedown was also very rushed speaking of which id like to see how they explain this one because that seems highly implausible
the good now the acting is decent as mentioned this has nothing to do with the show but the lead actress has such a beautiful face the clothing whilst sometimes inaccurate for the historical period i think theyre aiming for is most of the time quite beautiful
and whilst it has all these flaws it is binge worthy and has made me want to keep watching you want to see where the story goes although it is painfully obvious where the main story of dalphne and the duke is going so if you want a guilty pleasure series and you wont get too upset about historical inaccuracies then youll enjoy this just dont watch it with your parents youll know why within the first  minutes of the first episode"
"to start i did not read the books the story is based on i read some disappointed reviewers i cant say anything other than i totally loved the series the story is very interesting and keeps you wanting to see more it reminds me of young adult genre with a touch of gossip girl meets stiff english stories and that combination worked superb for me
the way the characters are being unfolded the costumes the acting the settingi am so hoping for more seasons of this great story please netflix"
watched all of it to see what the fuss was about would not recommend to anyone
the entire thing is just so illconceived no wonder netflix is going down the tubesi love fiction i love creativity but this fiction is actually so uncreativefirstly why reuse this historical period if youre going to walk all over it without thinking of any good reasons for it yes im talking about the wrong casting music costumes etc but please read onits as stupid as a worldwar  movie where all the nazis are jewish and australian women or a civil war drama where half the slaves are asian and norwegian theres simply no good reason for this other than we wanted to hire these actors and dont care about any truthson top of this the entire story being about the top selfish  of society being totally obsessed about their inbred genetics as they actually were just makes it all even more stupid its not even a story worth amplifying in this day and agenow if you do start out wanting to hire diverse actors which i applaud then make up powerful new stories that respect all the cultures of earth and empower them choose scripts that are clever funny entertaining by all means but lets actually help people be better random hiring practices into crap stories are not the way
love this series im actually rationing the episodes to prolong the experience
i love everything about it as far as live stories go its got everything you need truly an easy watch
the dresses and the surroundings in general are very interesting it takes you to another century the story is entertaining but i felt like there was missing something when i finished it seemed a bit pointless and the last sequence when daphne gave birth to her child is absolutely out of context they skipped to much that was a bit sad
i really support the choice for a more diverse cast fiction is a door another worlds that mind can createi
as the year  came to an end netflix released the first season a new series bridgerton that tackles the social issues of the unheard voices in its unique waybridgerton could easily be mistaken as a romantic comedy for family at first judging from the lighthearted tones and the style of story telling however it comes with many rated scenes and heavy dramas through out the show the show takes place in mayfair london in the year  with the clichedriven plot the story starts off by introducing the season of marriage where each family must present their daughters to the queen to be chosen as the diamond of the first water the bridgerton a family known for their good looking genes also sends their daughter daphne bridgerton undoubtedly she gets chosen as the most flawless and wanted of the season the town full of gossips that relies on the writing of lady whistledown the anonymous writer that has the whole town shaken with each secret she reveals has to fear her as she holds their faith in her hands including bridgertonsthe show can get you hooked in no time with the dramatic plot and fast paced story telling but its not for everyone many may find it cringeworthy from its cliche plot and soapy drama but its worth a try another aspect of the show that is new to us is having a diverse cast with more people of colours being royalties unlike in other western period pieces one of my favourite things about it is the music that is mixed between classical instrumental and modern days pop melodies it gives the audience an experience of how hearing our favourite songs in the ball room would feel like i would say its definitely a bingeworthy show with only  episodes ending with no extreme cliffhanger and a good feeling of closure
i am currently on my rd viewing of the series yes unlike many i have actually waited until watching the entire season before commenting i am loving itwhile i was initially unsure about the diversity as a student of history  a lover of the bridgerton books  historical romance as a genre once the explanation was included into the story i found that it became irrelevant people please remember this is an adaption of a fictional story it is not and does not claim to be an attempt at an historically accurate documentary about regency english nobility  gentry social interactionsone thing that it grating terribly for me is the insistence of some commenters on classifying the servant roles as slaves even in the holy land no i am not american yes that was sarcasm of the united states slaves were not everywhere  were not the only people serving in householdsplease netflix continue through the entire series of books i look forward to many more seasons of bridgerton viewing
honestly i dont understand all the bad reviews i binge watched this series and found it very easy to watch yes it is cheesy and cliche but thats what makes it good if youre looking for depth reality and meaning this isnt for you after watching this i am looking forward to reading the books i loved the costumes setting and music the only thing i found unnecessary probably was how horny simon and daphne were all the time
"ohhhh i loved the show and i hope it will be season 
well done all actors the costumens and performance was great i enjoy every minut of the show
easy to watch and understand no killing people war and all that
thank you shonda 
greetings from sweden"
season  left main characters daphne and simon out of the story although i appreciate other character development it could have been written better season  was quite a disappointment
there is plenty material that is perfect for colorblind casting this is not one of themthe production is beautiful and so are the actors but mehit just more idiotic writing and essentially a huge bowl of nothing
i was hooked within the first  minutes this show is the epitome of slow burn romance but with so many character arcs and portrayals within it is clear the main focus is of daphne and simon but the side plots of eloises search for whistledown anthonys affair with siena the whole debacle with marinas pregnancy etc there is so much going on but it is all orchestrated in a eye catching way i binge watched the whole season in a night but then further watched it to just fully bask in how wonderful it is i made an account just to state how highly i think of the show the one and only fault i found was the dressing for the era it is staged but i am not a history buff therefore it was a minimal effect to meloved loved loved it waiting on season two
"i enjoyed everything the script i was reading the book at the same time the acting the costumes the acting the music the decor i dont understand the bad reviews i have family and friends watching and loving it
i must admit i am re watching some episodes again starting book  and looking forward for season "
first thing i saw was that the two most reprehensible characters were both black  a young woman who was pregnant but  unwed  in those days unforgivable and the the dukes vile abusive father a slipup in the casting  what  diversity is great but it needs vigilance i would be interested to know if any white people noticed this my white friends think i am being oversensitive about what is essentially a piece of fun fluff
first of all i must admit that if it had not been for the recommendation of a friend i wouldnt have been aware of this series existence at the end and after observing it for the last four days i can conclude that bridgerton is not bad nor good as some people say in other words i found it completely decent for my tasteit is a series that despite having a good plot good tension and humorous moments excellent characters good cinematography and a dynamic interesting score that combines musical pieces of the time and some conversions of the present stands out more for some of its shortcomings than for its virtues to be more specific season s biggest problem was that the plot development felt somewhat unstable since although there were moments where the story was interesting there were others that seemed so cringey especially the sex scenes and boring that i had to momentarily stop watchinganother issue that plagued season  considerably was in the chemistry and relationship factors between the characters since it was noted that between the main themselves and some recurring ones these factors suffered and lagged at times as a consequence i had some problems connecting with some of them fortunately the aforementioned issues were able to settle firmly in the last two episodes albeit too little too lateand last but not least the series has several historical inaccuracies regarding britains regency era due to todays politically correct social agenda therefore my advice towards potential viewers that closely follow th century history is to proceed with caution and not set too much expectations from this part if not possible please refrain from watching itas i previously said bridgerton is an average series but also one that suffers a lot of mindblowing overhype therefore it would need some major improvements for season  in order to solve that problem regarding myself i could look forward for the aforementioned season but given the fact that season  left me with a somewhat bittersweet experience that remains to be seen
"beautiful actors gorgeous imagery and can we talk about the costumes such attention to detail was paid in all areas
truly enjoyable to watchevery second of it"
if you are a hard line period drama expert then i would not expect you to like this series at all you will most likely pick out the timeline mistakes rather than enjoy the acting and period costumeif you are open minded and hoping to be entertained then look no further the storylines are great from daphne and simon to anthony and the sharma sisters with the excellent pen and eloise in betweenits funny but it has its serious moments having watched  bank of dave before this series i could not believe that phoebe dynevor who played  alexandra in this movie was the same actress who plays  daphne she was superb in her characterthe surreal was  material girl being played at the ball and penelope played by nicola coughlan who will always be familiar has clare from derry girls speaking in an english accent of which you get so use to so much so when she disguises her voice with an irish accent you tend to forget it is her normal voiceoverall its a worth the watch but with a lot of out of timeline situations even to the point they might has well shown vapour trails from aircraft in the sky and you would not think any more less of the series because the acting great i get the idea that this is a st century drama set in the s  does it come across as that 
loved the show the cast was perfect the story addicting i cant wait for season 
bridgerton is one of those shows which keeps you hooked to the screen till the end i thought i would stop after watching one episode and watch the next after a week and so on but as i started watching i couldnt stop and had to go to bed late than usual to finish the show last  episodes will keep you anticipating waiting and excited markers of the show is very successful in keeping one indulged in their work kudos to the team
a sumptuous and romantic adaptation of the first book in one of the best regency romance series of all time the cast are beautiful and engaging and the story top notch with a swoon worthy happily ever after for the ages can i get season two now please
i never really liked black actors or watched their movies  but now i have become a fan media is such a powerful thing to change whatever racial bigotry is happening around the world
"could barely watch the end of episode 
a bad soap opera trying to make a th century love story modernomg this is so ridiculous my eyes are still bleeding if you like it it you need to explain why coz i really dont get it"
ive been a fan of jqs earlier work and the first  books of the bridgerton series i can not remember how many times ive read this series and know their stories by heart i admit that i was one of the fans who were skeptical with the cast not being faithful to the book when i first got wind of the casting choices i mean wheres simons piercing blue eyes why are the bridgerton mens heights wrong or daphnes hair colour is different than the rest but whilst i was watching this i forgot all those and embraced the characters with arms wide open this is a work of fiction and people can do well by treating it as such it is lavish it is fun theres drama and intrigue yes they have changed the story a bit to fit a tv series but i have learned long before that books and movies are going to be different i am giving it a  just because im still undecided if i like how they depicted one of my favourite characters i cant wait for anthony and kates story as that is my favourite book in the series bee it is
"i started watching this series and i must say that i really enjoyed it this series is fun to watch especially if you like gossip girl the costumes are well chosen and the characters are fun to watch as well it is not an accurate representation of the th century
however it is a series which is why it does not have to be diversity in a series is good in my opinion netflix did a very good job with the cast and the entire series"
bridgerton had better not be a real place because i want to say it sounds made up netflixs period shows all look like junk just based on the hair and make up of the actresses i know the scripts will be some form of young and the restless pablum whom are these shows for certainly not the folks who watched british series imported for masterpiece theater with alistair cook not the watered down dumbed down version today on sunday nights i guess theyre for teens i miss period shows for smarter audiences phones and tvs and cars got smarter period series though go watch some series from the s or s probably sentences and scenes are too long
i was interested at first but i guess i just dont think theres any chemistry between the main two characters it started to get boring and ridiculous at the same time like the things standing in the way of happiness were so stupid and contrived
i have never read the books i intend to and i heard about all of this hype about bridgerton when it came out i tried to watch the first episode with my boyfriend but we didnt really give it a chance and just judged it also because ive seen a lot of bad reviews now after we gave it a chance again and are now by the end of season  i have completely fallen in love with this show it has everything about romance i adore thought season two wouldnt match the romance of season  but just wow i love it so much even my boyfriend loved it i hope the next seasons are gonna give us good storylines and romance like the past two seasons
once you get past episode  it gets interesting i was told episode  but that episode had me falling asleep as well i think its important to realize this is a fantasy i dont think it ever said its a historical non fiction drama its historical fiction dont get me wrong the color blind casting rubbed me the wrong way at first but putting those nuisances aside i was able to enjoy the show better let me be clear im a latin american woman so the color blind casting bothered me in the sense that it came off as patronizing im aware blacks were free in england long before they were in the us but they were still discriminated by the likes of families like the bridgertons or featheringtons personally i dont think forcing people of color into narratives where they just werent accepted even if it is only fantasy does no one any favors i rather see stories that have yet to be told about people of color be given the netflix treatment theres plenty no point in adding them to a white story and thats my  cents on thatin terms of the story its typical for the modern day teen dramas however i wasnt that interested in the main protagonists storyline as much as i was in the featheringtons particularly penelope cousin marina and one of the bridgerton boys their story to me was much more interesting and worth coming back to i think its what kept me watching also wanting to discover who lady whistledown is kept me around other than that youve got yourself an mtv seal of approval type of show i never watched gossip girl but i can imagine what it was like given all the shows that came out around that time period its like a mix of sofia coppolas marie antoinette and any teen drama on mtv or abc family from the early to mid s theres nothing really earth shattering about it it just had the right formula to get it to the top spotin terms of acting everyone does a great job with their roles i cant think of anyone that did poorly the duke and daphnes actors are fantastic i just couldnt get into their story the duke though delivers hes a complicated character but he plays it in such a subtle way so hes not the stereotypical brooding playboy character daphne is not over exaggerated like most main female protagonists are in these period dramas the actress plays her in a realistic natural way this is why these two have great chemistry in the show because theyre not being ridiculous or over actingall in all i found it alright and will definitely be tuning in for season  as my title says just take it for what it is let it transport you to its world of fantasy and enjoy it
i initially thought this would be just another boring period drama but i was so wrong i absolutely did not expect to like this but i loved it i thought the narration was great
the series itself is alright it had allot of potential but besides the cringeworthy genderroles while black people around that time existed it seems like allot of people are offended by the fact that a european historical movie contains black people in a positive position while that actually existed there is enough proof just do your research instead of calling it inaccurateironically the same people offended would care less if cleopatra was played by a white blueeyed woman in the middle of africa bc or all the other movies where main characters of colour replaced by white actors with allot of makeup pure irony and im loving it lets change the narrative its powerful if you are offended because you actually think europeans should be superior in any time of history you are a part of the problem dear
my goodness so many people complaining about historical accuracy and colour washing this piece is fantasy it is not intended to be entirely factual if you are looking for that there are many more tv shows and movies that will suit yousecondly inclusion is not colour washing personally i loved this shake up in regency style drama and i applaud the show for making this choice not only does it change the formula for this style of tv show but it allows young women and men to see themselves in this context of being desirable which i believe can only be beneficiali believe this show is yet to find its balance of sex scenes season  was soft porn while season  was wholly without so much of a kiss
this is not historical i guess its just a light politically correct show nevertheless i enjoy it i usually watch it when i do my nails just to have something in the background i am not impressed by the acting or costumes or anything else
so i really loved the book series ive reread them over and over and was delighted at the thought of the series and sure its entirely watchable but its just such a disappointmentjulia quinns characters are multifaceted witty and generally very likable in shondalands version the plots are much more elaborate but the character building is just lackingi cant help but thinking that the shows creators have spent too much time thinking about the visuals and forgotten that the key to any good story us good story tellingalso im highly confused by the mixed race setup there are two ways of doing this option  is to disregard physical likeness and cast actors with different skin colour as british aristocrats without commenting further after all the point of acting is to play someone whos different from yourselfshondaland has gone with the second option to try to create an alternate reality in which people of colour would indeed be brittish aristocrats to do this require a credible historical background here shondaland just vaguely suggests that the king liked a black woman and the next you knew the court was swamped with black people in wiggs this doesnt make sense if this happened why is there absolutely no cultural fusion no inspirations in fashion and clothes the entire topic is just so sloppily handledjulia quinns strength is credibility that stems from that shes so well researched when she adds a female doctor i one of her series she makes sure that the doctor only uses technologies available at the time and studied at one of the very few schools available for females at that timein this version the detailing is just very sloppy if you dont bother to learn anything about  then dont set your series in  an example is when queen charlotte makes a request about a special license anthony answers that that wont be needed as he intends to get married in his home ie exactly the kind of situation ie outside of church that would indeed require a special license this might seem obscure if it wasnt for the fact that julia quinn dedicated a full postscript section to explain how special licences work is this super important of course not but when dealing with historical drama accurate details is what makes stories credible
very captivating im quite enjoying this series great acting great story lines definitely worth watching
quirky cute and quaint i could come up with many more adjectives to describe this darling show oh i forgot lovely lol this show could not have come along a more perfect time during covid we needed to smile i mean a really big smile and bridgestone delivers i havent felt this good watching a show in along time it isnt as funny as the book the duke and i but it is makes for it by being so totally cute the storyline is sometimes a bit foolish but who cares it is so much fun to watch i dont think the lead actors are well matched but i liked them very much and they do have chemistry the actress playing daphne looks like peter pans sister for the disney movie cute as a button i dont know what is going on this year but she is the second actress to look like a disney cartoon character the other is the lead actress in the queens gambit i cant wait for season  and read the rest of julia quinns books
"this is a really sweet and funny series but after a while you get kind of bored there are no new intrigues just the same one happening to other people also very few characters show any kind of depth
this is a light watch for sure just dont expect any kind of grandeur like pride and prejudice or emma jane austen it is not"
ive not read the books so dont know how faithful it is but this series was great fun it was over the top and very dramatic but also very funny which is exactly what you want from a regency era comicdramaits exactly the sort of thing to take your mind off real life drama it is definitely a good idea to spend  hours watching people dancing in beautiful clothes atextravagant balls and wondering if the pretty young woman will marry the handsome duke instead of worrying about a pandemic i definitely recommendbut to those complaining about forced diversity and wokeness of the series get a gripif this were a biopic or a retelling of a real moment in history then i would be as picky as anyone else about historical accuracy although i do think some real life figures whose skin colour is not particularly important to their story so it doesnt always matter but this is a fictional programme i assume all the people complaining that there shouldnt be black people playing aristocrats are also annoyed at the use of modern pop songs and modern phrases no right well its just racism thendo not try to disguise your racism by pretending that you care about historical accuracy when really you just dont like that youre seeing black people on the tellywell the cast are all excellent and are in those roles because they are brilliant and theyre not going anywhere so get used to itand just watch it because its wonderful good fun
for those who still havent seen this series but loves romance heres a must that should go to the top of your list super romantic and somewhat cliché it is still great entertainment serieslovers netflix bridgerton
loved this show so much great to see a diverse cast executing the script with wit and brilliant acting highly recommended those complaining about the casts diversity are showing how racist the world still is sad
enjoyable romp with plenty of romance looks greatand those complaining about the diverse casting are showing their utter ignorance during the period this drama is set england had a black queen the countrys second black queen erasure of black faces from historical drama is at an end get over it
"i dont understand why this series has got the star review i like it firstly yhr plot seems quite simple but its not disadvantage of it it shows the life and emotions of young men and women you can experience the same emotions secondly the cast is great thirdly the atmosphere and setting are great i really love costume design
so its good romance series"
"i have no issue with the diverse cast it shouldnt make a difference to story telling unless the piece is heralded as historically accurate in every way because of that i also dont care that the costumes are at times beautifully elegant and then in other scenes look like an explosion in laura ashley again thats not why i give it a mediocre score i watched four episodes back to back and just could not really describe four hours of story i felt that just nothing really happened it felt a bit repetitive rather than a sharp game of wits played by the two lead characters this is of course my review and my opinion
i find comments such as check your privilege to be quite offensive to the people who wrote in here this is a movie review by normal movie watchers does being a hard working reasonably successful white woman preclude any opinion that allows freedom of expression lest you be judged as a racist this is where inclusivity and changing the norm may fail as opinion and thoughts are judged and repressed
i didnt give a rats fig that three of the main characters were privileged black characters including queen charlotte i only thought about it when i read a comment on facebook am i surprised given some of the rhetoric that black actors would be involved in a project about the privilege of riches on the back of slavery oh no thats right i actually dont care because actors are adults and can make their own choices on who to portray and of that portrayal fuels the legacy of that period bravo to everyone i say its entertainment"
i was able to cope with the ethnic angle of characters but the directing is terrible for example the cardboard promenade scenes by the river are filmed as though the director has just shouted and action there is some awful acting and truly the worst editing ive ever seen
this is a beautiful fantasy and a great romance it was a little disconcerting at first to see all of the diversity but it wasnt long before i could just enjoy it for what it was regejean page is a dream boat and i couldnt get enough of him i went back and watched roots and for the people just so i could see more of him i wasnt disappointed i also watched snl when he was the host i cant wait for the gray man and d  d to come out
i completely binge watched bridgerton you can in love with the characters the families and just want to know what is going to happen with them i wish there was already season  its a must watch it reminded me of a gossip girl in the  s
"to help the producers and replace aaaaall the plastic flowers from gardens woods walls and poor vases😆
so ridiculous to see people smelling fake flowers those unnatural colours are hurting my eyes and sensespoor wind and poor bees"
i very much enjoyed watching this show so much that i watched all episodes in one day im not a huge fan of anything historical in period but this was extremely enjoyable i love the art having studied art at university the grand rooms with the paintings were fun to see the story was also compelling i wish there would be a second season
its pretty to look at thats about itno but seriously its not terrible its just not the sort of thing to take too seriously its a bit of fun the gossip girl of period dramasand im definitely going to watch season 
what a fab and refreshing show i was hooked straight awaywhat a fun and fresh take on period dramascant wait for the next series
a lot of reviewers on here have their panties tied over the fact that bridgerton a selfproclaimed interpretive fantasy is not historically accurate the anachronism is kind of the whole point of the show still ill say it  dickinson did it better because it embraced it wholeheartedly and didnt shrink back in bringing a modern perspective to the characters whereas bridgerton seems at times to waver still its a fun watch and the costumes and sets are dazzling
my only complaint is the contortionist that performed for queen charlotte in one scene was wearing stiletto heels which werent invented until about 
just an handsome lad cast and an okay romance story nothing special only ladies hype
this is just unbelievable how modern tv applies rules which defy reality this tv series is closer to phantasy books than to the productions showing the historic reality well if people buy lies colourfully packed this tv series is full of that
good romance and good plot i did read de books and the alterations are fine didnt bothered me at all about the black actors playing aristocracy in  it is a fiction welcome to tv open your minds please really worth watching
i loved so much this show the picture is perfect the cast is fabulous and so talented i took a star because that specific polemic scene between daphne and the duke it was unnecessary and totally wrong it was romanticized and we know it
totally overrated but still cute and fun i was more interested in some of the other family members side stories than i was in the two main romantic leads daphnes character was so sweet and proper that i found her a bit boring the duke was handsome but also felt a little bland i also dont understand all the buzz about how hot the sex scenes were they felt pretty vanilla overall and at times unintentionally comicalthe first half of the season had way more momentum than the second half at which point it started to amble about with drama that felt really artificial no matter how hard the writers and actors tried to invent conflictsome of the side stories with the less perfect characters that seem to be developed for later seasons show promise though so ill probably check out season 
what is wrong with all these bad reviews this show was not written to be fiction this series is a binge worthy show a lot like gossip girl really hope it continues as people are extremely too hard on shows these days and it ruins it for everyone who enjoys it
"i will say this first i did enjoy both seasons and will be watching when the new seasons come out that being said i found a few things of redundancy that were quite annoying at times
the fact that everyone including the queen were so caught up with what the gossip paper said was a bit over the top and hearing it narratedread every single episode started really being annoying after half of season  for methe other bit that was a bit much was the almost kiss like xs in season honestly the fact that the duke is not in season  or apparently ever again wasis completely lame even if the actor had other things going on there were definite scenesfunctions going on where it completely made no sense that he wasnt there i mean season  is all about the dukes best friend getting matched and the constant peptalks coming from the dutchess and not the duke about relationships was just lame i mean at the least he absolutely should have been at the wedding she made comments like i had to leave my child and husband to come here
it was the perfect story line for the duke to talk through and help his friendlastly i will say this regarding the new season getting ready to start i seriously wish it wasnt penelope featheringtons love story i find her character to be the most annoying of the entire show colin could definitely do better i understand being childhood friends but the shows title is bridgerton and her character is just too much of everything one romantic match that really shouldnt be it would be fantastic if they didnt end up together and being that mama bridgertons life is supposed to be the example of love she  deserves to find love again thats a love bloom story worth telling"
the prince gives daphne an extravagant jeweled necklace which she wears to the ball where the prince is expected to propose episode  before he can pop the question daphne runs outside she rips off the necklace and places it on the garden walla new scandal someone finds the necklace and reports back to the queen blackmails daphne to get it back absconds with it and daphne is desperate to find it to return it to her rejected suitor nope none of the above it just disappears and is never mentioned again
all one needs to imagine is gossip girl in the eighteenhundreds with the scandals and problems of the time period a lot of the characters manage to stay quite distant dispite good enough performances the sex between the main couple is really emphasized it got a bit boring the problems and solutions were very simple the season was ok those who enjoy silly romance dramas will love this i say meh
"im not sure why brits are so angry about a fiction tv show from a fictional novel shows interracial partners queen victoria received an african child as a gift and provided for her and her daughter the remainder of their lives capt john smith married pocahontas the current royals are of german descent not englishim guessing the angry bigotry caused harry and megan to leave their are records of interracial marriages in england dating back to the s get over it as far as americans telling a british story christian bale can play batman dick cheney and laurie then an american can direct a british series who else could have played bridget jones for heavens sakeif that is what causes you to dislike a story then dont watch it i thought this was pretty well done its intriguing and far less boring than downton abby the story stays pretty close to the books i hope there is a second season but it was pretty much tied up at the end i adored simon and thought he did a great job wigs were a thing in  britain i swear paul hollywood must have done the food hand pies and lady fingers and trefoils oh my
enjoy a glass of tea and some biscuits and enjoy a good story"
"bridgerton is a classic regency era costume dramaseason one had more fireworks on the romance side
season two less fireworks with a single story linei have watched plenty of these dramas going all the way back to claudius on pbsthey all vary in quality depending on their creatorsbridgerton is likeable middle of the road dramanot the top and not the bottom of the packi in particular enjoy lady whistle down poking fun at the aristocratic class"
i was very excited to watch the series the cast is amazing i love all the actors i think they could have eliminated a certain scene but the rest of the series i found it exciting the main character daphne had everything to be one of the best sisters but 
wow i cannot believe the venom in some of these reviews apparently someone touched a nerve why is it that people feel the necessity to tear everything down entertainment is entertainment that is what its for if you like something watch it if you dont turn it off i loved it because i got to fantasize and if it is not historically correct who cares i just needed something really good to take me away from covid and being quarantined in my home with only my dogs to talk to thank goodness i have them for the last  months when i watch television i dont want to always watch things that are literally true i got enough of that from the last  years of politics i want to watch something that makes me feel good makes me laugh sometimes makes me feel and yes   makes me swoon i want to escape even if for just a little while and i want to think that the world could be different could be better could experience change just maybe a bit faster or perhaps there are alternate worlds besides all that i just plain loved this show
im going to say it first to get it out of the way but i dont think for one second this show would be as popular if it werent for regéjean pageits going to be interesting to see if viewer numbers drop now hes not returning for another serieshes beautiful hes tall and elegant and hes the perfect period drama lead male but i also had a feeling he was internally cringing while saying some of the linesive never read the books i dont know how much they changed the story and i also dont know how much i am missing because i havent read the books but i felt everything was a little rushed and far too many characters squeezed inim really sorry i am sure shes a lovely lady but phoebe dynevor was boring it may be the way the character is written ive never seen her in anything else but there was just no personality to her its really hard to care for a character who is this dullthe relationship with the duke was ridiculous how are we supposed to believe that a couple of lingering looks equates to the kind of love someone would duel for they were married then we had an episode of continuous and very cringeworthy sex then they fall out and the marriage is supposed to be over i may have slept at some point and not realised it but it seemed as if wed jumped an episodei was far more interested in the outer characters i really wanted the king and queens relationship explored more it seems to be far more interesting than the lead characterspolly walker as always is amazing i really loved nicola coughlan and claudia jessie toothe characters of the brothers and their respective women seemed to be setting up for better storylines tooi am led to believe that each different book follows a different sibling and i am hoping the next story will be more interesting and written at a better paceis it historically accurate nope it doesnt pretend to be nothing is presented as fact the costumes are gorgeous again not always accurate but who really cares in a fictional production i dont listen to mainstream music so i had no idea they played modern songs at the balls until i read some reviews so that didnt bother me eitherit was watchable and i didnt hate it but the dialogue was tacky and i hope that improves for the next series
i enjoyed the second season more than i thought i would it had a good slow burn romance and it focused more on small intimate moments and exchanges of their personal struggles than on simple sexual encounters like the previous season the outfits and decor settings were beautiful as always and i really enjoyed every episode
when you learn the reason behind the lead male characters failings youll wish you had stopped watching after around the fourth episode a few interesting characters but mostly superficial ones not developed gratuitous overextended sex scenes did little to further the story the music was either out of place or out of the appropriate time period trying to turn this periodpiece soap opera into a morality story by the end is ultimately not successful and the husbands behavior is laughable be it by early english standards or ours
so different from the books and impressively just as good amazingly awesome acting from both jonathan bailey and simone ashley and the other cast as well the only thing i regret is not seeing more of them
modern life ideas on period dramas not bad i must say but whats the point made in c only way is essex vs womens rights we are not getting out of the wigs here are we
this is an easy and enjoyable watch i love period pieces and really liked the updated spin a lot of the negative reviews mention how this isnt an accurate portrayal and all i can say is if you didnt like hamilton the musical then you probably wont like this show take it for what it is a st century spin on th century england
i found this show so magical rich and interesting until the characters married and moved away i think that should have been the end of the season the momentum of the will they or wont they was amazing and every note was pitch perfect the final episodes had none of that and i think im done with the show for that reason the rich diversity btw isnt a problem its what makes the show feel so fresh and different from the start and the show floats on its leads sheer charisma especially at the end so the casting is a huge plusi dont blame the showrunners they followed the books so we are where we are but i did lose interest in and even affection for several characters by the time the season was over
i usually like these kind of period productions but this was an awful mess just silly and not entertaining i wanted to like it but no
the series managed to tell the story beautifully by inserting issues of diversity and important themes without changing the essence of what is told in the books the changes that appeared served to add drama and as a connection for the next seasons i loved the cast the scenery and the costumes the soundtrack with current songs played by the vitamin string quartet is a bonus great entertainment looking forward to the second season
i watched season  in speed  like i always do in the netflix app and i was recommended to watch season  instead of season  as i heard season  was cringy and they needed a lot of sex to make it a hit now i can tell you i loved season  the eye stares the characters that were explored and the chemistry of the lead actors was through the roof now people that hesitate to watch bridgertom season  go watch it you wont regret it
"i quite enjoyed watching this series and ill tell you why
trying to figure out who is author of the gossip paper
i didnt bother myself with the color of the cast but the talent is there it is not an american historical piece it does not even take place in america take joy in watching this series for pure enjoyment of fantastical entertainment how gossip gossip gossip kept life interesting in a time where there was no radio tv and computers how women were to look pretty and how a man can easily ruin a womans dignity or even her family name how a man could be a gentlemen or be a crazy spoiled hissy footer when you watch the series youll know who i am talking about i didnt love how this series was written as some of these teenage characters though of aristocrats seemed to lack a certain amount of sex education but i dont know how much education these girls were even allowed to have back thenso lets move onif you choose to watch this series youll notice that some of the music during their many balls through out  there are actually modern songs played classically and it was something i quite enjoyed when heardif you have time to waste and you want to be swept away into an era of aristocrats and noblemen and women gossip and sex you can waste it on this
follow to the story of an girl in an aristocratic family looking to give her hand away in the search for a husband finding love in a predictable way a gossip paper spreads news around the town which spoils the name of a number aristocratic families so much so that even queen wants to know who the author of this gossip paper is"
if youre looking for an historically accurate depiction of regency london with all the austen flair you can handle move along this show isnt for you however if you know the series is based on julia qinns bestselling series and you know that she is romance writer  a rather steamy one i may add  then stick around the makers of this show were going for fun and spicy the multitude of anachronisms music colors ethnically diverse characters etc display the playfulness of the show its not meant for stuffy and uptight viewers it is meant for viewers who enjoy a little spice in their streaming time without outright raunch so grab some ice cream a glass of wine and sit back to enjoy
have you ever dreamed to see the brightest balls of the british aristocraty in the early th century  to observe the ruses and the dirty tricks of scheming mothers to marry off their noble offspring if so bridgerton is for you london during the regency  despite king georges mental illness for the aristocracy its business as usual and the wedding season is one of the highlights of the year matchmaking can ensure a familys fortune or its demise centuries of heritage and patrimony can be secured or wiped out its a matter of the utmost importance for the bridgertons family and for their neighbours the featheringtons family daughters are to become debutantes daphne bridgerton is smart and a flawless beauty but her oldest brother after their fathers death is overprotective and scares off all suitors making his sister look undesirable the unfortunate young girl is cruelly mocked by lady whistledown the anonymous author of a scandalous society newsletter but daphne doesnt give up and forms an alliance with the most eligible bachelor the duke of hastingsalthough smart and cynical bridgerton is still a show about romance love that nothing can stand in the way of it is also about the frivolous life of an idle aristocracy scandals can easily destroy lifes but they also entertain the ton those who are spared camouflage their relief by harshly judging those who have been singled out rightly or wrongly whether the mysterious lady whistledown is a whistleblower a woman determined to change mores or a cynical disillusioned and frustrated spirit its hard to say probably all of thosemore classical than it pretends to be the show is especially noteworthy for its beautiful costumes and colourful sets  dresses jewelry salons and balls are all worth a look the story is pleasant if sometimes simplistic and even naïve some of the characters are endearing but its the visually idealized depiction of the aristocracy that really catches the eye
please give us all  books im currently watching season  for the second time
side note on the racial aspect i also just finished the latest anne boleyn adaptation where anne was black that made no sense a real life character the star of the show and we know she wasnt black granted it is rated here at least they try to explain it the theory that queen charlotte had black ancestry has been a long running historical theory yes fine likely disproven for centuries they picked up on that and spun an adaptation around it why notwouldnt quite explain how in the course of her lifetime then the entire high society was desegregatedbut at least they put some thought into itthat combined with the fact that the queen was not the central character and honestly i think that was the least of this series problemsim curious to read the books sounds like the characters lost a lot of their personalities here simon is gorgeous but has  emotions max anthony is just not likeable ugh wish we knew more about the featherington father benedict had a half sketched storyi also do wish people would stop comparing this to downtown abbey there is a level of subtlety fineness and sophistication in the da stories and the dialogue bridgerton doesnt come closethis show started slow but got better before it got worse again the individual episode ratings tell the story but even bad popcorn is still popcorn  and im ok indulging in bad popcorn sometimesset your expectations low turn off critical thinking and youll be fine
i read the book about  years ago and it was true to the setting and mood i absolutely fell in love with the simon and daphne the music and songs in this series are also beautiful as is the chemistry between our main couple i recommend this series to everyone
pride and prejudice emma and o clone in a marvolous series i pure enjoy it
stop the propaganda of modern vulgarity netflix is obsessed with cheap vulgarity this is becoming a pattern i know why they do that its all psychological propaganda this tvshow doesnt add any value a shallow and empty tvshow where the characters are nothing but a bunch of hormonal beings with a deficit moral compass dont waste your time guys cheap entertainment
as a viewer who didnt read the books i binged the show in one day i enjoyed the characters costumes and locations honestly a show doesnt have to be historicallyracially correct to be entertaining watch it its good
pure unadulterated enjoyment a wonderful theatrical dramatic romantic production wonderful costumes delicious relationships and characters i cant wait to watch more thank you to cast and crew for giving us this in 
dont look historical accuracy its meant to be light fun and who wouldnt appreciate that these days the dialogue is quick the fashion gorgeous and the sets are lovely
ive read the book years back and this was a really good adaption from book to series they captured everything every little detail it took me a day tk finish it all the actorsthe costumesthe dialoguethe acting everything was good
i have so many issues with s but season is amazingespecially daphne and her relationship with simon was so problematicim talking about the sa scenekate and anthony are just phenomenal again both of them are flawed characters but not as problematic as season
bridgerton is a visually appealing period drama that is unashamedly lavish gaudy and modern costume and set design while likely to anger those who care for historical accuracy in their period dramas are fabulous and over the top the cast is diverse and the score is filled with string quartet interpretations of modern hitsdespite the flashy visuals i found he almost singular focus on the romantic relationships of characters became dull after a while i think some more developed subplots could have helped keep my interest
i hadnt heard of the books but added this to my list when i saw it was produced by shonda julie andrews as the narrator beautiful sets clothes and photography plus modern songs by string quartets why cant people take shows for what they are  absolutely exquisite escapism loved every second of this
i love historical fiction but this just didnt sit right with me i enjoyed the first couple of episodes and then the show just got boring they used sex to make things interesting and spice the storyline up but i didnt think the main characters had very much chemistry so the sex scenes were boring plus i know this is an unpopular opinion but daphne  committed spousal rape daphne held simon down while having sex forcing him to give her a baby and the look she gave him afterwards made me sick thankfully i was prepared for this scene since research on the show warned me on the flip side simon should have been honest and told her he simply didnt want children and not that he couldnt a trigger warning needs to be added to the beginning of the episode the one thing that i found fascinating was how uneducated women were about life and why education especially education about womens bodies and sex is so important this isnt a show i will find myself watching over and over like downton abbey and it had so much potential the costumes music and sets were beautiful but it lacked direction i think reading the books would be more entertaining and fill in the gaps
apart from the woke lenses through which this series is made and which i have simply ignored there is a certain unity of style that keeps one glued to the screen taken as a fairy tale for adults it is most enjoyable at least as long as you dont really take it seriously very witty dialogues superb costumes and very sexy actors and actresses of all sexes races and lifestyles if you pardon my french
politically correct frivoulous soap opera with a modern touch in a marie antoinette and great gatsby fusion a xix version of gossip girl just more boring actually in its attempt of affectation
nothing about this show makes sense and it does nothing to address the obvious issues its a funny fantasy world but nobody should refer to this as a period drama as it is a complete alternate universe where race doesnt seem to exist or be acknowledged nor are any of the characters enduring waste of time and bears no historical reference whatsoever
absolutely worth watching truly hope there are many more seasons to come
as someone who has read the entire series many times this was an excellent portrayal of the books i love the diversity of the cast and every person played their part to perfection thank you shonda and netflix for bringing this to the screen i truly hope you do the entire series the stories are quite remarkable and get even better as they go along since you get to see the evolution of every family along the way
it was fine i enjoyed it but it was very basic im not really sure what all the fuss was abouti was expecting something a bit more sophisticated clever and different but it just appeared to be a normal soap operaesque tv show dressed up in period costumenonetheless i did enjoy it im just not sure if ill tune into season 
"after i watched couple of first episodes i found out that this show is based on a books written by american author and its a historical romance
im not a fan of romance novels but i was curious what was the original authors idea based on what ive already watched so i stared reading the first book and the binge read  of  novels while i was binge watching  episodes of bridgerton
so if you stick to historical accuracy you wont like this adaptation but do you really need to stick to it
you need to watch it if youre just into this whole era of lavish costumes pretty hairdos long glancesmanner of talking and almost jane austinish heroes  youre gonna love it
cant wait for second season"
cannot fault it every episode left me wanting morethe series is superb the actors are excellent the costumes settings scenery and music are absolutely stunningi do hope they hurry up with season  as its just perfect
in season  i couldnt imagine caring for anthony this much but this season really helped us understand his character much better episode  was so good with all the flashbacks and i felt really bad for him his character development was amazing and it made me so happy he finally started to believe in love kates character was also my favorite they make such a great couple i never read the books so adding a love triangle didnt bother me nor any other changes as a hopeless romantic i enjoyed every part of it i didnt find it cringein my opinion their love story was much better than daphne  simons and i also liked these caracters more other siblings had good storylines as well so id say this season was better in general they had more chemistry and better acting
as an avid julia quinn fan its difficult not to feel a sense of disappointment during the first  minutes of bridgerton i have read all the books twice and followed her with excitement on social media since the series was announced my feelings were a little mixed about the casting but i knew that if this fit julias vision it would work for mewhen the series started i felt like i was watching an episode of desperate housewives nothing against desperate housewives because im a fan but thats not what i was expecting here i wanted colin firth and jennifer ehle in pride and prejudice i immediately felt embarrassed to have recommended this with such passion to all my friends i was disappointed i almost stopped watchingand then i let go of my expectations about what i wanted the series to be and started to enjoy it for what it is its lighthearted and its fun im glad i didnt stop watching
i read the books so long ago and loved them so i was excited to hear about a netflix adaptation i loved it i think it was wonderfully done though shondaland took some liberties with the story and added plotlines and characters it stayed true the overall story i enjoyed it and cant wait to see what they come up with next
if you are looking for something fun and entertaining this is your series simon and daphne are magic for everything we have gone thru in  this is a refreshing get away loved it
i love this series the characters are well developedthe landscape is beautiful and the crazy match making balls are dazzling its nice to see people of all races and colors participating in life not just boring white people they also explain how the main characters became royalty and how that can change at a drop of a hatthis was a great escape movienothing morethe acting is fun alsoi truly enjoyed this series
i read and loved these books many years ago i thought this show was gorgeous it was never going to be an exact translation from page to screen and im fine with that it isnt totally historically accurate but im not viewing it as a history lesson its a rich sumptuous engaging fiction set at a particular time in london with a fabulously diverse cast of great actors bringing julia quinns original imaginings of a particular society to vibrant life
what an unpleasant show if i wanted to see sordid sex ho hum costumes and bad acting i could watch any number of netflix shows i was shocked how bad this was and really if you dont want to present a period piece then perhaps pick a different project
pride  prejudice meets gossip girl with a sprinkle of  shades lol i actually really liked this series and hope there is a second season production was beautiful storyline was captivating and the chemistry between the actors was great i highly recommend
for the most part i enjoyed this little romp into history with its unusual take on the drama of the time i liked the mix of characters and casting choices some of the characters were great some were not i like the fact that women again proved much smarter than men some of it dragged and there was way too much sex unnecessary sex if you let go of some of the boring parts and some ridiculous characters its good for a girlfriend binge
i must admit i dont catch everything because they talk so fast in their british accents but im enjoying it so far the costumes are lovely and while some of the acting is a bit campy i still enjoy it all its a spectacle to be hold for sure
bridgerton is very entertaining love the mystery of trying to figure out lady whistledown love the romance and the steamy love scene between lord hasting and daphne the storyline with the pregnant marina thompson performance was magnificent the featherington family entertaining the queen was hilarious looking like wanda sykes in a wig and lady danbury was excellent to all the people that are leaving low reviews i didnt watch bridgerton for a history lesson i am very well educated regarding the time period i watched bridgerton to be entertained and it did not disappoint thumbs up ten stars across the board
"i see that the historical incorrectness of this show  the presence of black people in the british s high society  got some people confused or even got them to dislike the show but for me it was a refreshing playful and very necessary correction of history why does a historical tv show  fiction after all  has to represent history correctly especially when that history is the actual incorrectness i really liked the alternative history they presented
i enjoyed the show the characters the costumes and the love story if you dont like romantic costume drama youd better skip this one"
anthony got robbed of a potential good serieskate was my favorite at the beginning but her own constant yes no i hate you i love you go away come back stop dont stopthe worst character ever so annoyingi had to force myself to watch the most annoying character and thr worst story everjonathan baylee deserved betterkates character is beyond cringy and annoyinh
loved every second of it stays surprisingly accurate to the books i was at first wary of the acting choice for simon but i have to say he was perfect the show also did a good job of incorporating narratives from the other books to prepare for the next seasons
"hey sad people
im referring to people who gave  etc what exactly would you like to see in this show what you would like to watch
im trying very hard not to swear or say something bad ha
perhaps everything must stop because in your little sad brain everything is much below averageas a reader as a woman who never stopped reading about anything i found many of your comments offensive and perhaps your iq is low maybe you should admit thatwe live in  everything has been said everything has been done so perhaps everyone you rate this series with  you should stop watch tv ok you should leave the rest of us the stupid people the less genius persons to watch something okayi have never rate anything with  people who are like me must speak about themthose who dont believe in anything who is disrespectful about everything who insult any effort the saddest the lowers those sad peoplethe series is finemore than fine
the cast is great
please have the brain not to compare it with any book  its sad
the story is fine
haters are always people who feel less
this isnt all about that show wake up world we dont need those people you arent like them"
" and fresh show within an outstanding script and production underline with actress and actors  you can see in every frame the joy acting
the soundtrack are the top cerry of a wonderful entertaining cake show
a wonderful season  and i cant wait to see season  hopefully again with such a brilliant cast and production team
yes i love the cast this is not a history pic this is entertaining at his best"
is it accurate to historical reality no does that mean its bad absolutely not finally a good costume drama that provides jobs for both white and black actors usually im not a big fan of anything thats romantic or dramatic but im  swooning over these series and i really needed this because lets be honest this pandemic has been a real debbie downer to moviesseries couldnt find anything good to watch for a while until i found this
"this show was so addicting and so good that i finished the entire season in one sitting
bridgerton is awesome if you are an avid lover and reader of historical romance and regency england it is so refined and elegant but the show still had me eating out of its palm with drama and mystiquebridgerton is so full of plays out of the feminist playbook its a wonder it works so well with a dated setting and society women taking control of their own lives finding their own sensual pleasure without men getting educations and being on the precipice of adventure this is a world where racism and colorism is a thing of the very recent past but one in which a society moves forward and places people of color in equal positions of power quickly and if you are not paying attention it is hard to find out when that transition actually took placethis is not a show meant to be historically accurate as some have tried to relay towards their judgment on its entertainment value this is a show in which modern  music is given a classical and voracious touch of the orchestra where young readers watchers and lovers of ball gowns secret lives courting and duels at dawn especially those of color can see themselves in stories that are predominantly white and elitist this show hits all the high notes of romance and sensuality and violence and mystery and suspense and i cannot wait for the second season"
if you want a slow paced dull and incoherent drama sprinkled with enough eye candy to prevent you from crying with boredom youre in the right place my flatmate uses it as background when theyre working on admin im not sure how this holds the attention of viewers who are watching it for entertainment though obviously tastes vary but i dont get it and believe me i have triedwith bridgertons budget id like to see some realism but this looks like modernday actors playing dressup im not even going to get into the colourblind casting which is a product of an infuriatingly shallow american identity politics but is ultimately so daft in its results that theyre barely worth engaging withtheres some stunning actors clothing and scenery sure but theres also lots of crap wigs and distractingly ugly makeup a lot of it doesnt seem crap in a historical realism way just in a the costumewigsmakeup departments were drunk way and the plot isnt interesting enough for suspending disbelief to be a worthwhile use of energy who are these people and why should i care about them sorry im too much of a humourless republican the anti monarchy sort not the stop transing our daughters typethe wee lesbian from derry girls is a highlight bringing up what would be a two star rating to a three shes too good for this messoverall if bridgerton is whats popular on netflix its no wonder people are cancelling their subscriptions ive seen more entertaining qvc ads to be honest
loved every minute well casted beautiful sets bring on series 
gorgeous witty innocent sexy poignant colorful sexy quirky relatable fantastical perfectiondid i mention sexy i have not read the books but plan to now im a huge fan of period series poldark being my favorite this is just as enjoyable with more hot moments btwn the lead characters satisfying in every way going to rewatch from start to finish once i post this review dear netflix plz renew we need more
this show was so wonderful the drama the costumes the s vibes i loved it all and such a refreshingly diverse cast for a bit of escapism the plot was predictable and enjoyable the wardrobe and sets a joy to watch and the classical reimagining of modern music was a great twist the whole thing was a treat for the senses from start to finish i highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoyed gossip girl or pride and prejudice and anything in between cant wait for the next season
i loved season  but i am honest i loved the duke the most and i really missed him in season  but season  was beautifull the costumes the whole scenery for me i am not that fond on eloise so her story was a bit annoying the love story between anthony and kate was great and i even fell butterflys when they looked at eachother kate is a beautifull woman and it is so great that there is so much diversety in this world just love it so sad that we must wait for a year
"a story about prejudices of fate and posibilities to cope with your injuries to heal gossips life intimate space desires people love story
full of blind actions that somehow guided to happiness at the end life maybe not always be like that but this movie is"
this is total garbage please stop ruining historical dramas
never having read the books but seeing netflixs top  indication for this series i started watching the first episode what i mean i truly understand that there is a scarcity of roles for black actors in period pieces but how can they honestly believe that viewers would accept the suggestion that many members of the british aristocracy had very dark skin and that racism at that time did not exist however after muttering what are they joking a few more times i totally forgot about all this and started to really enjoy this series in fact i now love this seriesmuch seems historically accurate for example women were slaves to the social mores of the time they could only strive to make good matches the only way they could further their social standing which in turn would further that of their siblings etc an out of wedlock pregnancy meant the total ruination of ones entire familymy only complaint here would be that the sex scenes were way overdone otherwise this enjoyable historical series is a great way to get ones mind off our problemfilled present
"beautiful settings and couture
nice story of daily worries of the so called upperclass"
loved this series the costumes the use of the english language the scenery and the queens hair julie andrews is icing on the cake highly recommended
i always loved jane austin themed movies and i am so delighted to finally see people of color included i dont care if it is historically correct the costumes are stunning the love stories are captivating the duke is the perfect portrait of a real person with baggage like oursa real man that needs to be loved the music is incredible i literally cant find one flaw to these series you cant stop watching if you start
it is not without sarcasm im breaking to you that queen charlotte was most likely mixedraced and regency england was much more colourful than you can learn from your significantly whitewashed history books for sixth graders having said that bridgerton is not about history its about feelings about the most complex of them all namely  love what i admire the show for is that it doesnt try to overanalyze the feeling in the same time it proves that mutual attraction between two people has no chance of surviving without anchoring it in friendship and without courage to communicate openly fears and admit weaknesses the show is tastefully filmed has music score which probably will make history and the two main characters are not only beautiful humans but also conveyed by the very young actors feelings seem incredibly genuine which is more than one can say about the most of contemporary tv productionsmovies kudos hat tip and big thank you to all of the team for proving to this cynical old lady that true love conquer all not necessarily has to sound like a cliché
season  was watchable but season  turned me sick i had to endure it for my girl friendthe show directors spent a lot of effort in costume and flower show and not even  of those efforts to proper story  plot such boring stuff
although off to a slow start after the first few episodes i was hookedbeautiful costumes diversity and an escape from the pandemic worlddont take it too seriously and get hung up on logistics allow your brain to switch off for an hour or two and enjoy a beautifully put together love story
the stoey is pretty entertaining from enemies to fake dating and later married its the usual but i still like it the story itself is really slow so i dont think it needed  episodes but its okay i guess its a love story after all it shows how each person has different love journey and ending even if its mostly about simon and daphne overall its a good watch but i wouldnt watch it the second time though
"o que falar de bridgerton
ficou perfeitoooo
amei tudo do inicio ao fim cada lagrima derreamada foi a certeza que bridgerton vai sempre ficar guardado no coração
o regé é a phoebe deram um show de atuação assim como o elenco inteiro 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤"
thoroughly enjoyable it plays like masterpiece theater only with more sex ignore the racists rating it down because of the multicultural cast the story and acting is so well done you wont notice or care
an enjoyable watch that i was unaware was based on a series of novels
after reading peoples rave reviews and being a fan of period romances i decided to give bridgerton a go from the outset i was irritated by the almost farcical nature of the setting the choice of actors for the various roles and their somewhat limited acting skills i was prepared to overlook the innacuracy and the clichéd pc approach to the portrayal of the regency period as i knew that it was intended to be purely fictional entertainment however what really spoilt it for me was after reading the glowing compliments on the standard of the costumes noticing the spike heels of the queens dancer  minutes into episode  seriously yes period romances are known for the sumptious and often extravagant costumes and in most cases every effort is made by producers to get these as accurate as possible and in keeping with the time period as this is what sets it apart and creates the period piece identity for this genre using spike heels which were only invented in the s in a period piece set in the very earlys would in my mind be a faux pas on the same level as using a cell phone or other modern accoutrement to top it all my irratation turned into disgust upon hearing classical renderings of music by modern artists like ariana grande maroon  celeste etc in the background i mean really the producers couldnt even give the series a semblance of period accuracy by using music by great regency era composers such as mozart beethoven rossini schubert liszt or mendelssohn to name but a few i was so put off irritated and critical after the abovementioned that i barely made it through to the end of episode  before deciding that it is an utter waste of my time if you have anything better to do even if it is just watching clothes spinning in the dryer rather do that than watch bridgerton
the movie was unconventional but well written and entertaining great choice of actors i cant wait to see if there will be a season 
i am not one to review shows or any kind at all but to be honest i honestly do not think that people has given this show enough chances while it may be unrealistic especially due to the diversity of the characters i do find it refreshing to have a show that is diverseits a fun witty show that is not to be taken too seriously with everything that has been going on in our reality this show definitely gets me out of it even for just a moment and that to me is enough to make this show a worthy to watch
second season was chefs kiss season will do it for you too if you are into period dramas but the second one the slowburn the chemistry 🔥 the performance it is the only time i admit that a sequel of a movie or series is better than the original
if you read these novels apparently youll likely be disappointed i did not read themif youre looking for historical accuracy this wont be your showif you want deep characters with absolutely inspired writing you might want to passthat said this show can still be entertaining if you come into watching it with an open mindthe best description i can come up with is gossip girl in hamilton style set in pride and prejudice produced by shondaland at its base it is a drama set up around a mysterious gossip paper  expecting from that to see perfectly timeset wardrobe and music is like expecting gossip girl to have been realistic about life in nyc its just not like hamilton you have a theoretical time period dominated by white royalty but reimagined with poc so again if youre looking for time period realness this wont be your showive seen a lot of complaints about the characters on here i have to say i didnt feel the same  i felt myself rooting for daphne and simon i connected with characters one with a birthright he does not want a couple who wants to break norms in a time ruled by them a character who wants to find love but finds complicated setbacks at every turn another torn between his malice towards a father who never loved him and his love a mother fighting for her daughters against odds etc are they immensely deep no do they put together a decent storyline that can keep you amused for an  hour first season i think soor at least it did for meits more ratedr scenes are also kind ofcute the naïveté and genuineness on behalf of either character to me were far more adorable than the call room hookups from greysoverall its not emmy winning drama gold but i dont think we usually come to shondaland shows expecting that gold at least not since  greys anatomy we come expecting to be entertained and it certainly does that so long as you dont allow details of time period or race to stand in the way of a decent story and dont have expectations re how true this show will be to the novels
"for people who gave this series a low rating because they didnt agree with the diverse cast due to the time period era or etc please relax no crime has been committed its just tv this series has drama romance and comedy simply entertaining if you cant get pass the diversity and etc then you will not be entertained because your stuck in your head to busy comparing your perception of reality to a romance book series or tv seriesi remembered my mother watching the movie imitation of life when i was a child and i remembered not fully understanding the movie until i watched it again at an older age being at an older age i also understood that prejudice and racism didnt allow for a biracial black woman to play the role of a biracial black woman passing for a white woman instead they gave the role to a white woman however i did understand as a child that the character was crying about her mother if i understood that as a child then what is it in the year of  that people can not watch a show with diversity and etc
bridgerton was truly entertaining"
"garbage trying to rewrite historydont waste your time seeing thisnetflix always makes medíocres series is nothing new but this one overcomesjean page is so hammythe actions are bad and hammy especially the protagonistthe writing is horrible and there is a lot of unnecessary sex scene in everything
the costumes are so fake looks like plastic you gonna think they are created for childers theatersi dont understand why it received so much positive critivism from the specialized criticismif you like j as books or british historical dramas skip this aberraction"
an absolute must see this show really warmed my heart it had me laughing and crying at the same time that is down to good writing and amazing actingthere are those rare gems among television series where they really stand out from the rest this is one of them
clearly an attempt to tick boxes here which brings out the cynic in so many also a historically inaccurate story but a story which may suit the costume drama fans and lovers of historical romance id say give this a go
if you are too concerned about reality than just think that this show is a scifi in a parrallel universe the show is warm and lovely with actors that suit the roles i just loved it and hope that the next season will come soon
"a lot of times when a book or series is converted to visual media the reader that is fond of the books is disappointed with the result ive seen reviews like that and believe it is usually to be expected
however as someone who has not read the books i can say that i have thoroughly enjoyed this series and am eagerly awaiting another season or 
this netflix series is a joyous presentation of a romance novel come to life the reimagining of georgian  regency society as integrated is wonderful to see  i especially love queen charlotte yes there are historical liberties being taken but so what its not a history documentary its a fun time watching silly romance and drama this is for fun not edification so if youre in the mood to watch some deliciously spicy romance not pg and wonderfully served up scandal broth brought to you by the creator of scandal yay this is the show for you
i must say the casting on this is wonderful every player is wonderfully cast for their role and i havent seen a more beautiful assembly of acting talent in years  if ever every single person is at the very least interesting in some way or downright beautiful i will probably watch this many times while waiting for the next episodes"
the show is charming and fun with quirky characters and intrigue in the lives of the regency ton lady whistledown is a secret gossiper that publishes her work and stirs things up the show focuses on the bridgerton family they are portrayed as respectable and raised well by the mother by contrast their neighbors the featheringtons are snobbish and desperate to marry off their daughters while dealing with money problemsever read a romance novel well this series is based on a romance novel not realism tho real historical things exist here romance novels are essentially a fantasy type of world the female finds her perfect match the guy listens to her respects her admires her finds her smart and interesting if thats not a fantasy i dont know what is modern songs werent classical covers in this time period either and jesus aint white in our real world get it ah but its a fantasy type of show essentially an alternative reality and fairy tale and they can do whatever they want im glad they didbonus alert the racists hate this show im especially amused by the liars in reviews that say that im a person of color or im black and proceed to bash this show i love that this show is cutting the racists so badly especially since its now netflixs biggest hit sweet sweet sweet suck it racistsoh and for those that say that this is reverse racism racism is systemic with a dominant side that oppresses other races there is no such thing as reverse racism because the oppressed group is not dominant in the system let alone equal nice try racists suck on thatthe show is based on a series of romance novels by julia quinn who started the bridgerton series in  and is a consultant on the show my understanding is that each season will focus on a different couple as per her books with one of the bidgertonsthe series is fun and entertaining and lighthearted with likable characters everything is rather dark in our real world i like a moveaway from the gritty stuff i want to see a happy ending and want to see love win i enjoyed watching it and cant wait for more 
"so ill start with the positives eloise she is the most interesting character and easily the best actor in the series the sets and designs were beautiful alsothe negatives overall the series just doesnt work
its was interesting they used modernpop melodies for the soundtrack but it ultimately felt out of place and was too distracting i found i would miss entire conversations because i was more interested in working out the songs the acting was d grade at best and the characters are also very boring so underdeveloped that i actually didnt care about most of them or even worse i hoped things would end badly for them particularly for marina siena and simon argh they were just painful to watch as for the protagonists they had absolutely zero chemistry daphne was no more interesting or complex than some ditsy airhead while a cardboard cutout would have had more charisma and charm than simon i accept he was good looking but he was just too boringand the writing  terrible theres no flow no charm no humor no wit its just boring boring boring and feels clunky and weird most of the time i literally lost it at you do touch yourself thinking  wow this show is so stupidits really unfortunate because the actual concept and story is very good it just wasnt fleshed out well enough its a real pity because there was so much promise"
fine acting beautiful production and one of the best things i have have ever had the pleasure of seeing and no surprise it is rated th best netflix programme it deserves to be higher but then it is rated no  in many countries so the bad ratings are from people who just dont get itseason 
"it is obvious from the very start that its is going to be highly polished and is superbly produced
everything about it is excellent from the brilliantly chosen cast to the sets the costumes to the clever music
i found no fault with it it has such beautiful variation scandal comedy romance etc if you dont get it then move on the sex scenes are very steamy but you must understand why if you dont then please get in touch with yourself and dont be a prude
great from start to finish laughter and tears  wonderful"
not sure where all the hostility is coming from i thought it was a really fun watch i enjoyed the romance the humor the time period binged it in  days which i rarely ever have time for dont pass on this based on other peoples bad reviews
"to everyone whos hating on bridgerton im only  episodes in to the series but so far ive found it so refreshing and eloquently done
i havent read the books but i might start doing so because of the series i personally love that the cast is so diverse its a nice change from the constant all white cast in period pieces ive seen historically inaccurate  sure fine but its a welcome change to see how women were terrified of the economic proposition that marriage was back then it dictated their entire lives and reputation when it comes to the social classes and hierarchy it has always been relevant so to see it on screen shouldnt shock people so muchin conclusion id recommend to watch it it has the hunts of period pieces we know and love yearning slow burn romance suspense and drama it has a perfect combination of gossip chemistry well developed characters and intriguing plot
now im off to watch the rest"
i simply loved it from loyalty to books to choosing characters i think the thing i liked the most was the choice of the actors i loved the representation they had with the main black character the black queen etceven though racism at the time was indescribable they changed that and that was the best i loved the sets and i loved them i just loved the costumes that look like they came out of a fairy tale and were very expensive one of the things i didnt like was how daphne handled simons situation and the loyalty to some characters but other than that it was perfect
"cringed watching this show
mostly dull andor dislikeable characters absurd dialogue mostly bad acting anachronistic etc
not fun or charming or thoughtful or educational  just ugh
basically sex and the city in expensive period costume"
"really enjoyed this story line is great characters are casted well and the acting is great
looking forward to the series bought the book as i cant wait"
"this is a drama for the times  s  the sets are amazing stunningly so the costumes well thought out queen charlotte the kings wife  george iii is interestingly afrocaribbean and her staff dressed in court dress of around  courts as we know never move with the times
the dialogue and themes are st century jane austen is sufficiently replayed that one can watch that for authentic period dialogue
no one has four daughters coming out at one time each one came out in a different year and had to find a husband by the years end
lord berborough visits at home without visiting cards more shocking the duke has no cravat at a society ball 
a servant wears his bicorn hat crossways  like a ship in full sail coming towards you the last person to do that was  y prior one horatio nelson
the more modern way was as the line that one walked
at one at home the lady of the house converses with the visitor  who appears to visit without a manservant  whilst two daughters play cards and one a harp the girls of course should be around the visitor listening to what she had to say
excellent drama and i recommend it to everyone as for  did it ever happen once no it is a drama"
"if you like history with romance action and great actors you are at the good place  loved the books love even more the série even though some things dont totally match but thats normal as it is an adaptation and a great one 
i watched all the episodes over a night  so addictive and well played"
cant describe how much i loved it pls let them be a nd season
i have read all the bridgerton books and i must say i am happy with the results of the adaption some areas has been modified to reflect modern subjects which gives the series more point and at times relatable feeling janes austin styles with a few more saucy moments enjoyed it so much watch it all in one day would recommend to anyone
mind you i rated s a  i just loved it everything worked nothing wrong the actors in this one i think they did a good job actually considering what they were working with whoever wrote the script must have been high on meth cause huh unlike s this one took a whole different course unrelated to the book that it was supposed to be about i was so disappointed they should have stuck to the books hopefully moving forward they will go back and at least incorporate  of the storyline in the following books
is it highbrow entertainment no is it fun and melodramatic and pretty much what i expect from a regency romance yepi really feel like the negative reviews that are upset they cast black people in the show and thats what ruined the historical accuracy really need to reexamine themselves last i checked everyone also has perfect dental work and the vast majority of the women are surviving childbirthnot to mention if youre watching a regency romance for the historical accuracy youre going to be sorely disappointed in general
"vivian leigh a brit born in calcutta played scarlett ohara the daughter of an irish plantation owner in the american south
natalie wood the daughter of russian immigrants played maria in west side story
john wayne played genghis khan burt lancaster played cochise mickey rooney played japanese in breakfast at tiffanys
people only object to diversity casting when it goes agains their prejudices
and diversity casting or not this series is greatespecially for those who wouldnt be caught dead reading a romance novel"
season one was good rated  season two is flat out spectacular and i have to rate the series a  now averaged because id like to give season  a point above  acting sets costumes music writing is wonderful i wish some would stop comparing to the books why would you even watch it if youre looking for it to be exactly like the books doesnt that seem like a dull prospectthe chemistry between kate and anthony is palpable and so much stronger acted and interesting than between daphne and the duke in season 
incredible story with a good soundtrack and a great cast in fantasy everything is allowed only not racism
awesome series cant wait for more the costume and cast were great loved how the book was brought to life
what a disappointment after the first seasonboring riddled with inconsistencies and a very bland plot line this season was more than difficult to get through the only redeeming feature was the diversity seen throughout and the representation of the indian culture through the charmers
people trashing this show are just mad because its not identical to the books this show was actually good the actors were phenomenal and i was captivated from beginning to end enjoy the shonda magic if you havent read the books read them they are great but this show is good too surely i cant be the only one who understands the meaning of the word adaptation surely people dont believe a series is going to be word for word as the books
as we say in french « cest cucul »a series full of good feelings and marshmallow my wife loves ita good point for the use of pop music titles in classical music version the game being to discover the title and the performer failing to be passionate about the scenario
when i first started watching bridgerton i thought what in the world then i caught on to the fact that it is campy and fun and entertainingnot meant to be taken as historically accurate so people should just take it for what it is and relax as one reviewer so eloquently put it thinking bridgerton is historically accurate is like thinking superman is a documentary that statement is a hoot ok so i need more characters to post i am looking forward to season  because reviewers say it is better but i have been enjoying season  as just a visually pleasing and relaxing bit of escapism
to begin i normally cant stand stories like this but kudos to the acting directing plotpace and scripting  all of this excellence  make this highbrow romp a well rounded tale does this mean i will immediately leap into the first empty seat as soon as the very recognizable melodious theme resonates throughout the house not hardly regrettably lack of gunfights explosions and car chases normally ejects me from any suspected presence of pending boredom oddly enough i am quite pleased i actually sat and watched some of this show and was very pleased as previously cited the acting directing and general production are far above average excelling well beyond the current idiocy posing as entertainment the maturity in which diversity is skillfully molded into a flowing script is uniquely presented lacking is the typical and ridiculous puerile spiteful banter of all men are evil especially white men intelligent delivery is much more palatable than hate and decisiveness will i continue to watch maybe
i loved it i watched and finished netflix in  but this today on xmas day was such a delight i need season 
season one the duke and i or the diamond and the roguish dukethis is a shonda rhimes treatment of a fictional historical regency era british romance novel titled the duke and i by julia quinn one of those novels that you see at the grocery story typically snickered at and read maybe by house wivescovers often of the torn bodice varietywith men on the cover looking like the infamous fabio do not going in to this series thinking that it is in any way a historically accurate portrayal of regency era anythinghave you seen any of shonda rhimes other works of fictionif however you go in to the series thinking this is going to be a mixed cast romp in regency era costumes filled with sex lavish scenesand gossipshondas bread and butter you might find that it is colorful funny and maybe even a little bit sexyi had no expectations going in i have never read the original booksand honestly i am not a big fan of shonda rimes other productions right from the start i was really struck by all of the historical inaccuracies and that is with my inexpert knowledge but some of the dialogue started to make me laughthe lush sets drew on my imagination and i really hung in for the friendship and blooming relationship between our two main characters daphne and simon i know i am a sucker for romance and that is what slid this in to a dirty little secret you know the ones you are ashamed to admit that you enjoyedseason one is ultimately the story of the oldest daughter and fourth of eight brigerton siblings daphne and her first season coming out to the elite ton ie attempt to snare a husband as all good girls of her time are expected to do in her presentation to the queen she is favored with her eye and listed in the gossip rags as this seasons diamond her eldest brother and head of the family anthonys job is to help daphne procure a proper match for her and the family anthony who knows more than he should about mens more baser desires and habits takes his job a little too seriously and manages to scare off the majority of eligible suitors in just the first few days daphne meets the arrogant duke simon who happens to be a good friend from anthonys from boarding school which is how anthony knows he is entirely unsuitable for daphneor so he thinksdaphne and simon out of desperation strike up an agreement to fake a courtship this will work twofold it will make daphne seem more desirable to suitors and keep simon off the market for pushy moms after his title during this fake courtship their hate changed to friendshipand maybe lovethis isnt the end of the drama as there is a large back story involving simons youth relationship with his father and why he doesnt want to have children this provides the story with the classic romance angst and obstacles or impediments to the couples happiness there are also the side stories of the other brigerton siblings all eight named in alphabetical order and some of their friends and neighbors in addition there is a story only hinted at in this season about the queen and her relationship with her husband the kingi enjoyed this enough that i will be checking out season twoplease dont disappoint me shonda rhimes and writer chris van dusen
a perfect adaptation of julia quinns books in addition to having an incredible and diverse cast that brings a lot of representativeness which is very important nowadays and its really sad that there are so many people talking badly about such a good series because of disgusting racism anyway watch bridgerton  its a beautiful series and you wont regret it 
i have not read the book so am new to this story loved the characters the diversity the romance the strong female characters trying to assert themselves in a time when women were anything but independent romance mystery intrigue real life messes and good messages thoroughly enjoyed it
i advise you all not to take this all so seriously and close to heart this is just a fun and light series with beautiful costumes great music and good actors i loved simon  daphne duet their chemistry is over the roof and both actors are perfect for their charecters
the amount of money that goes into the making of this show pains me as the creators of it would also preach about issues of the world such as poverty the first season was at least at a decent pace with some chemistry however the second season was one of the most boring things ever created the best acting came from onscreen mother and son and penelope and eloise at the very end and that is not saying much i regret wasting any time on it at all
i love period drama the more historically accurate the better this is not historically accurate but it is good entertainment ive seen  of season  and i am pleasantly surprised there is a very intense tension between the two main carachters and i could hardly leave the series to get some sleep well done team bridgerton 👍🏼
this may not be the deepest best written show but it is has all the drama and excitement a person would want in a fun romance it is literally gossip girl with the characters wearing s clothing if youre looking for historical accuracy this show doesnt have it whatsoever if youre looking for drama love sex and a beautiful setting well this is for you i enjoyed each episode and would recommend you check it out too
so yeah i have not read the books but this series seems to me to be more of a parallel universe from the moment it is mentioned that the king married someone of colour and that made it ok for all people of colour to rise and make normal lives of themselves for that period this is what i wish our past would have looked like the way things could have been in a more openminded world where colour just gets out of the equation and everybody has a fair chance i personally liked it because i actually took it as a piece of fiction and everyone here just complaining that its not a  adaptation of the book it is not a  adaptation of the book its a nice world and option we could have had in another life so yeah
simon and daphnes relationship was very sweet in some places the drama repeated itself it was a bit boring but in general i had fun and liked it
"ok it not like the book not everyone can read a book
i have never read the book or normally watch series like this one but thought i would give it a go
i couldnt stop watching it i had to watch the whole season in one go
for my first time in this type of series i thought it was brilliant and really hope there is more to come because i would watch more"
my goodness the acting in this is painful was it this over the top on purpose the majority of the cast have at least one eyebrow raised at all times the script is terrible and trying to be too wordy with everyone outdoing each other with witty repartee i love the diversity of the cast but it was a hard watch like viewing a period drama while smacked off my head on lsd
"leave it to shonda rhimes to put a fun and colorful spin on a medieval period piece if youre looking for historical accuracy watch the crowne instead
this is makebelieve  pure and simple  with more beautiful costumes and people than plot but they explain the diverse nobility as the result of the the king falling in love and marrying a black woman thus nobility included all people of color in this land of make believe nothing about political correctness for shonda rhimes in fact she did a similar medieval spin on romeo and juliet series for abc  its a shondaland world and we get a fun glimpse into it enjoy the ride"
could not wait to binge season let me say visually and musically it did not disappoint the costumes were beautiful the settings were magnificent the music composition was excellenti love how the actors are from different ethnicities and how the integration into the storylines have a a natural feel it is so refreshing i wish more movies and series could do thisi did find the story between the main couple to be a bit lagging wish they took the route of the younger sister forgiving her older sister and being supportive a lot earlier in the series maybe at episode  the love romance felt a bit rushed at the endi liked that their were multiple storylines and more character development occurred but sometimes it became a bit slow and some scenes were just unnecessary especially during the last  episodesall in all the series is a like a luxury indulgence something to treat yourself to once in a while
honestly i watched this show in  days and i loved itis it my fav series of all time  absolutely not but it was fun watching and somethimes you just need a serie like this 
great show id recommend this to anyone talk about a real winner
these bad reviews are ridiculous the show was amazing i needed a new historical drama after finishing outlander and this was so entertaining i enjoyed every single episode give it a try you wont regret it
the two people who romantically find each other insult each other while trying to make each other jealous even if it involves the loved sisiter while being secretary madly inlove yawn
i am not one to ever write about stuff i watch but this show had me so amazed im ready to rewatch it again seriously i will not spoil anything but this is a must watch  shades of grey doesnt hold a candle to the scenes in this show i only pray a season  is already in the works
i enjoyed this series i see some reviews referencing the inaccuracies of this era but this series is not supposed to be a documentary this is a fantasy and the setting just happens to be the s if you like quirky romance novels then you will like this series i dont watch much tv and i watched this in  days 
firstly i dont usually enjoy romance as a genre and regency romance is my least favourite type of romancesecondly the actors who should have held me in their sway were largely unfamiliar so i wasnt coaxed in by a familiar face or any other part of anatomyfriends with a sense of humour and a sense of taste told me i would enjoy bridgerton but it wasnt suitable to iron to not an issue  i dont iron  i shake the clothes vigorously insteadi adored the first series and then adored the second all the more im working upto queen charlotte because i feel ive cried enough recentlyits not a family watch but i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys being lifted out of our less than sumptuous world the acting and scripts are spot on and the use of music inspired
just watched the first season in  very late nights that push and pull romance that keeps you wanting more ignore the bad reviews this is an intriguing show not a scandal but fun and romantic and serious a little predictable here and there but who cares its visually beautiful rejejean page mmmhmmm cant take my eyes off him and those trying to compare this to the real world of the period and black and white that was never intended not everything has to be black andor white this is fiction and entertainment just watch and enjoy the characters and the story
hey you  i dont what this fuss is all about i absolutely loved it i do love jane austen  it cannot beat her but only because i don not compare the this show is absolutely stunning in its own way the actress is wow and the actor is even more wow so pleasewatch it
a sloppy series with several historical flaws psychologically superficial dialogues are extremely poor a cheap melodrama inspired by a mediocre book collectionthis series failed to give a good portrayal of english society in the regency period and to develop a relationship in a credible way it looks more like a soap opera
i will be frank with everyone season  was okay even though i did like some of the woman rights issues they dealt with the chemistry between the leads was a little lacking and the sex scenes were nearing soft pornhowever season two is leagues better when it comes to chemistry jonathan bailey and simone ashley had the most amazing chemistry ive ever seen on television also the psychological burn was so much better the obstacles were unusual for a love triangle with so many twists and turns that keeps you at the edge of your seat right to the end of the eighth episode they chose to go the more complicated path where all three involved had high stakes in losing the love they built with each other especially between the sisters usually love triangles involves sabotage schemesbut here the schemes are all done for the love of family so bloody refreshingi think moving on every season will have its on flavour depending on which sibling they will cover next i honestly cant wait for eloises season that is sure to be hilarious but i definitely do love anthonys jonathan bailey flavour this season the portrayal of his emotional struggle regarding the death if his father and being torn between love an duty is equally hilarious and heartbreaking all at once all signs of a great actor love love love is all i have left to say about season  watch it
i have to highly recommend bridgerton it is riveting racy and very sexy it has incredible actors and characters there are a number of of the main bridgerton family who are magnificentyou will be on the edge of your seat dont miss itand do ignore any bad reviews its odd they exist especially when you see that its globally popular
"i saw many negative comments ok this is not an historical series but will bring you into a romantic atmosphere nothing to do with jane austen shes my favorite writer and i saw many people trying to compare with prideprejudice or other austen stories
please watch this series as it is different love stories some romantic and others less without the aim of being a precise window on an historical period
actors phoebe is delicious and rege jean has a wonderful voice please watch it in original language"
as i started watching the series i began getting acquainted with the characters and the storyline i must admit i was alway waiting to see more as all the episodes began to expand the lives of this family the eldest daughters search for a suitable match and her hope of love included in it bridgerton indeed was interesting and surprising how the writers came to put forth interest to see if the path started by the characters would play out the way they were expected to go or if they would indeed have another way to bring a fresh light on the situations i really enjoyed the first season as i would hope for more episodes to come in the near future this was a show by happenstance i began watching and by choice saw it straight through with a few breaks of course till the last of the last episode as im unsure on production dates and unsure when it was tape im not sure if we will see more but i certainly hope to see a lot more of the bridgerton family their friends and foes and what happens in there lives
"im loving the series so far ita supposed to be like gossip girl set in the regency era and its not supposed to be serious have fun get lost in the fun i read the books in my twenties and they were all silly and frothy i mean how many dukes and duchesses and royalty were there for the characters to fall in love with
my only problem is that i wish daphne was more like the character i imagined in the book but still great show and man the actor playing simon is so handsome this is a must watch"
this one is a right old mess take pretty people put them in fancy pretend costumes give them a teen soap opera storyline and get them to bang each other costumes do not necessarily make a series highbrow or bestow any quality especially when they have all the historical authenticity of a klingon outfit you need great writing and actors for that a polished glittery stool albeit one that is cynically aimed at a subsection of the market that apparently loves devouring such matter
"i love the show its a welcome change from the typical royal family uptight conversations it is a fictional piece and i thank the creators for having beautiful people of all races included in major rolls does this make the show or break the show absolutely not do the modern songs playedon strings in this period make or break it no who the hell cares move on great show
ignore the    stars that may drop this one below a "
please dont judge this on one or two episodes please watch the whole series the reason i say this is because people have said they only watched one or two episodes duhthere are  to find out the story and fall in love with the characters there are some amazing actors their performance are so convincingfantastic production and of course anything that comes from netflix has to be brilliant as does anything from shonda rhymes
you better kick on the air for this season its a sizzler just loved it i adored the first season and never expected to be so into season  my favorite its that good
gossip girl set in regency england might be your thing or it might not personally i loved it just dont expect anything close to austen this is not in the least bit historically accurate but its great fun if you appreciate it for what it is gloriously trashy escapism
the cast is brilliant like really brilliant i had a few favorites who made me laugh wont give away anything in case you havent watched good story love the diversity and equality well done to those who made this happenacting on another level you really feel the chemistrya bit of a masterpiece
i thought season one was quite good once you got over that it had no historical accuracy but if watched purly as fiction ity was entertaining season  was just awfull i didnt even bother with watching the last episodes because it just butchered the book and i hated it  i loved the book by the way and the main reason i stopped watching season  was that i didnt want to ruin the book any more than i already had so i couldnt read it again
thank you shonda rhimes for your exquisite talents the writing the wit and casting was well done you gave a modern take on the period drama mere morals are not worthy
i have never read the books i was skeptical when i saw the unusual casting but i gave it try because the duke is very handsome and it was awesome i didnt like the weird casting of cursed but this one is perfect forget about colors history and races just look at the beauty of everything and enjoy
they attempt to show society as it would be if it were free of bias and encouraging female empowerment it is an exercise to show that racial inclusion would not be offensive or lead to societal breakdown with all the complaints the experiment has failed for some i personally enjoyed it immensely
"ive been up late for hours binge watching this show but i have to stop at episode  and have some sleep
i love the characters and the diversity if only life was really as accepting of everyone as it is in this show at first i was confused and thought this is not how it was back then its hardly like it now sadly but then i didnt care that it wasnt following with accuracy i just loved the characters and their stories characters i thought i wouldnt like i do and characters i thought i would like i think are terrible self serving people
i dont know the books have never heard of it before so i went in with no expectations and so probably no disappointments i would recommend this but i guess if you love the books you are probably going to be disappointed from what ive read from others"
what a series has everything sit back and enjoy every second
beautiful story cinematography and cast definitely recommend
it is as good as i expected from the trailer i have waited for a few months and i didnt regret it at all one thing that i dont like is just it is come to an endi demand for the second season to come next year i have finished it in one sitting because the very first episode has captured me perfectly oh and also ragejèan is my new obsession for the whole month
super fun and exciting show with intrigue the characters are all well done and i love the brightness and colours in the show the broad and diverse cast is amazing would love some lgbt characters though
its fiction so dont expect it to be historically accurate they never intended it to be dont expect it to be exactly like the book its based on the book not an exact replica for me the show adaptations diversity music characters made it much more interesting than the book my advice would be to give it a try with an open mind people given it scores of  to  are obviously not even taking into account the fabulous costume and setting design those reviews read like what a petulant child would write it may end up not being your cup of tea but rubbish it is not grow up people
i really enjoyed this show a lot i did not read the books and i do not usually enjoy period tv shows or movies but i was hooked on this show from episode one i was invested in the characters and each episode kept me on the edge of my seat the costumes were amazing i loved everything the scenery and photography was spectacular i found myself crying toward the end it really was a beautiful love story and very well done i was happy to see such a diverse cast represented as well
season  was beyond annoying and predictable couldnt even finish episode  the dance between kate who was entirely overly pretentious rude and flat out annoying and anthony was miserable i think id hate my sister if she was kate and even worse it wasnt love just some played out fetish on falling for the person you initially disliked the most what a huge disappointment
i have no idea if this was historically correct or not ignoring the obvious diversity in the casting which i loved and i didnt care one way or the other im sure if you watch a program like this it is because you like romance and for me the main recipe for making this brilliant was the casting the chemistry between all the actors was fantastic the pacing of the episodes kept me hooked and i cant wait for the next series
"i love the show its a spiced up regency era drama series that i think jane austen herself would find amusing but would she be equally as appalled at the continued sex scenes i found myself cringing at the granville house parties not exactly something i expected
other than the unnecessary amount of sex thrown in its a good show i do hope for a second series cmon netflix and etc dont let us fans down"
"this show is flashy and ridiculous but just enjoyable to watch
i love the characters the costumes are amazing and the acting is great if youre looking for historical accuracy this show will not be for you if you enjoy a good story lovely but complex characters definitely give it a watch just leave all expectations at the door and im pretty sure youll enjoy yourself
i binged the whole first season and i freakin loved it im sure its not for everyone at times i found it very clichéd sometimes cringey even  but come on its a period drama its not a damn documentary that has to be historically accurate it has great humor in it toosuffice to say its my new guilty pleasurelooking forward to season "
i had heard much talk about this show and had put it on my list to give it a looksee when i had the time to do so have to say i was not disappointed i found the stories and performances intriguing the depth of the thespians portrayals drawing me into their stories so that i was invested in the outcomes i found the show to be such a delight that i am now interested in reading the books upon which it us based well done
wonderful and lovely story play the duke and duchess actors doing it quite well definitely renewable to  seasons loved it
"this is a very good start to what i hope will be a very long series
as a book lover i couldnt be happier
im sad to see the bad reviews people must keep in mind that this is fiction and it is a very good production
congratulations to all the professionals involved i think you are on the right path please dont let the negative reviews throw you down all the book clubs that i belong to absolutely loved it
dont keep us waiting long for the second season"
youll find many nods to jane austin in both expressions and situations thoroughly entertaining binged it in a single day not terribly original but thats ok because i love how many balls they attend the costumes the charactersall of it
as an avid reader i read this series through the years as they were published it was a favorite a screen play will never be exactly the same as the book from which it was made with that in mind i was able to fully enjoy the series as its own and i was not disappointed thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining and im hoping for a second season
why notat the beginning i saved this title on my favorite list and to watch it some times but than one day i told myself it is timeit is a good one the diversity is fantastic and the vision of putting in place all the cast is really great we are living in an interesting time of period and our thinking must be more open this is also a message of the movie think open and say the things as they are because only in this way problems can be solved andi saw it already two times
i think a lot of people do not like this series because they disagree with its modern societal acceptance in a period piece i think if you have an open mind you could really get into a show like this when i heard about it i wasnt sure what to expect but honestly i really enjoyed it and bingewatched the whole first season it reminds me of gossip girl and a mild game of thrones mixed together it is pure magic fantasy and i get lost in it every time i watch totally recommend
"poor acting no story and same old bs political drama to nothing original
total waste of time and i couldnt even complete entire season  if i could i would rate  stars"
this show is literally gossip girl in upper class s england and somehow they managed to make it work i was actually interested in the show from beginning to end very very interesting show
i dont get all the bad reviews everyone saying it is not historically accurate its fiction i found it entertaining colorful and fun the characters were interesting and attractive i have really enjoyed the series and look forward to a second series
absolutely loved it and the contemporary edge made it for mefully invested in the characters the music the costumes and the romance cant wait for the next series
"great production im always unsure when books i like or love are translated to screen i read every genre but still have a soft spot for my georgette heyer austen and other good regency romance writers bridgerton is very well done and i want the rest now im very happy with the a knights tale style slightly moderndifferent take with regard to music dancing and costumes the wit and humour of the books is not coming across but that may not be a priority for this production even so im sticking with my  star rating
im already watching it over again and have new bridgerton converts in the family the proof was when i asked on christmas day did they mind if i watched the first episode just to satisfy my craving and then we could do whatever else they wanted they then insisted on watching the lot never did that before
i also liked that they used actors of colour to portray some aristocratic families or servants just the way it could have been if not for slavery or prejudice very interesting
thank you netflix thank you shondraland second series please"
a great escape romantic sexy if you take yourself too seriously you might not like this no its historically accurate on all accounts but who cares if you like to occasionally watch something that takes your mind away from the current woes of our world youll love it strong female characters i loved it
"i dont see how anyone could think this should have been nominated for golden globes seriously the details and accuracy to regency era is complete sit and dont even start me on the literal soft prn they put in almost each episode
while funny and cringe worthy at best it gives off a trash tv vibe similar to hallmark and netflixs christmas moviesonly good thing about this whole show is the soft prni fail to understand how you could pick up a regency era romance book with  starsthats before people who didnt read the books but saw the show flooded it with  stars and make a show out of it what blackmail does the author have on netflix and shondaland how cringey is the name"
what can i say bridgerton season  so worth the wait  ive watched all  episodes of season  so far in the uk which were absolutely brilliantcolin and penelope what a combination another great start to the seasonim loving how the series is sharing stories of various couples which will no doubt link in to the seasons that are due to followwhat a transformation of penelope she has definitely come out of the shadows  corner both colin  penelope realising that they are in love with each other is beautiful mesmerising  roll on for june  and the remaining  episodes i cant wait and im sure they wont disappoint
i absolutely love the show from the costumes to the music to the chemistry between the actors the show is awesome
i expected people to be very upset about the diverse casting and so many reviews comment on that rather than the actual show full disclosure i wouldve given this  stars but added one to balance out the exaggerated onestar reviewsim a huge downton fan so i leaped at the chance to check out this show i also liked sanditon which was lighter and more saccharinei binged the entire season of bridgerton in one night and am totally not sorry my standard is whether i enjoyed the show and felt it worthy of the time spent watching yes and yesi love period pieces but also know shonda rhimes takes no prisoners where drama is concerned i was not disappointedof course some of the plot is thin and characters fun but predictable archetypes but thats also every jane austen novel there are few revelations that cant be predicted based on similar shows and tropes the featherton family  a twist on cinderella with evil stepmother and ugly stepsisters daphne and simon  beauty and the beast etcbut boy did i love watching every episode lots of imho overthetop love scenes meant to be salacious and graphic but sometimes made me giggle due to the exaggerationi loved all the bright and often garish costuming which was as much a part the characters as anything else lots of candy colors rich blues purples and pops of red it was a visual feasti thoroughly enjoyed this very fun and escapist show and found it refreshing to see black people in period garb just living like everyone else and not discussing race i didnt know i needed this show but turns out i need more like thisget your girlfriends together and watch
i rated the first season  but the second one is better now i gave it a more passionate because of the desire although the erotics is much less compared to season  the music is perfect as always
absolutely loved bridgerton this adaptation from julia quinns series was more than i could have hoped for i have read every book in this series and loved how it was brought to life with some details i didnt even know it needed i loved the diverse cast the costumes setting music just everything all the actors were cast beautifully and i really enjoyed watching this series i cant wait for season 
"season  was brilliant i really enjoyed it i loved the characters and the story line i couldnt wait to watch season 
season  was dull  boring i didnt enjoy the new characters especially the sharma family they were dull  predictable such a disappointmentim hoping season  revives my love for the show ill just sweep season  aside and pretend it didnt happen "
well this tv series really turned on my tears the plot twists kept me on edge and the gossip was amazing and historically king george was losing his mind unfortunately every family was struggling and no one had a perfect family what an amazing diversity in the cast although this diversity did not exist in england it felt good that it existed here in this series
"i am a huge reader of romance and was extremely excited that this series of books was being made into a series
i loved this show from the opening sequence the vibrant colors the people milling about balls the season all of it
i did not give it full marks because i felt the chemistry between this seasons couple was lacking
i hope the success of this series helps other romance novels be made into series as well"
i have not read the book series so i watched this with no expectations and i thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was  entertainment it is not a historical documentary and thats the beauty of it it is historical fiction for the modern audience it is make believe  a world where there was racial diversity amongst the most elite in society and its all the better for it i have absolutely no problem with switching off from the nightmare of  and instead watching beautiful people in beautiful costumes entertain me for a while it is definitely no jane austen or brontë  but thats a good thing those are the classics and will always remain so this is a lavish and modern spin on the genre i thought that all the cast and crew did a fantastic job and im looking forward to more escapism with the next season
this is a great show  funny silly basically gossip girl in the s its mainly based on the first book but dips in and out of the others and adds a few new charactersif anyone is complaining about the diversity of the cast and it being inconsistent with the period then their racism is fully showing the show makes use of modern songs amongst other things inconsistent with the time period yet no one cares about thati can only assume this is because they dont actually care about accuracy and just want an excuse to vent their racism i suggest they take a long hard look at themselves and why it bothers them so much
loved season  romantic amusing with back stories that explain character motives the personalities of the new women characters in this season were engaging as was the plot tension galore and if you like horses this season is for you
loathed season  made anthony into a jerk edwina into an idiot left out the positive relationship between kate and her stepmother out almost completely in the books there was a loving and positive sister bond as a key point in the story edwina knew kate and anthony were in love and the ridiculous wedding scene between edwina and anthony had no place occurring at allthe brigerton books had charm and laughter this adaptation has neither the costumes colourblind casting and locations are the only redeeming featureswhy adapt a romance novel and make the characters less likeable unlikely to continue with the series if they cant include the fun and laughter from the source material
first of all please ignore any negativity soundtrack alone is worth watching the series for actors are amazing there is humor scandal teary moments and the storyline keeps you engagedthis is not your typical historical drama and thats a good thing so dont bother comparing it its unique and very inclusive which is what people are not noticing so well done to the casting companyterrific performances from just about everyone i recommend this show if you are looking for something a bit different
not sure why it has less stars on imdb didnt even felt like checking reason but i was hooked to it  its a period drama and beautifully made i didnt like daphne overly innocent character though  she reminded me of  shades of grey main lead also the her wardrobe so sooo dull
"best love story only got  more episode to watch im totally in love with it hope they making a second  more
the only criticism i have is the one reference to racism so far it didnt need it it just took you back to todays horrendous world but apart from that its a beautiful story if only we could all live in a world like that"
"light a suited finally for a first season
a great history and some twists were unexpected at least the identity off whistledown itself was left a totally mystery to the very end"
"if you like historical correctness in a show this one isnt for you however if you want to get away from reality for an afternoon and like a bit of gossipy romance i deffinitly reccoment it
it looks stunning the acting is good and the characters are well develloped the multible stories are a bit predictable but i gess that belongs to the genre
dont go in this expecting a trilling show just get yourself cuddled up on your couch with some thee and enjoy"
i really love the concept of this show with race being a nonissue like it should have been in this world it looks amazing seeing the scenes and cast s anthony was really good he is clearly a very talented actor unfortunately kate ruined it for me i found her acting so wooden and cringe it made me laugh at points and totally ruined scenes it did not match the depth of jonathan baileys acting
just finished the whole of season  one of the most beautiful things i have watched look out for some awards the cast was very well chosen really great acting everyone worked so well with each other the scriptwriting amazing the ladies costumes are to die for they are so well designed and so delicateeverything about the series is incredible its no wonder its so popular all over the worldwell done netflix you just dont get anything wronglooking forward to season 
lovely romantic period piece that was never meant to be a history lesson it lightly delves into the absurdities of propriety that still plague our culture today while elucidating the struggles of women poc and lgbtqia both in history and our current culture these topics are just barely touched upon and instead are illuminated through an entertaining and romantic filter for those of you who are cringing and complaining about the historic inaccuracies of having poc in starring roles i would warn you that your racism is showing this was was never meant as a historically accurate piece with its larger than life fashion music and society if your problem with this series are the poc then i would suggest your problem does not lie with historical accuracy but instead with deep seeded racism and the advancement of poc within our society otherwise you would also be crying that thank you next by ariana grande was playing at the ball
really enjoyed it watched the whole season in one setting hope theres a season two😁
unloved this show i watched the entire season in two days  simply marvelous
i highly recommend giving bridgerton a watch especially if you like romantic dramas its a lavish delight of a drama in a opulent setting its important you dont expect the subtlety of austen  yes this is a georgian era romance but written and then adapted for a modern audience  but in simplest terms smash austen with gossip girl and you get bridgertonso yes ive read all of julia quinns books and love the brigderton family is this the same no is it therefore bad also no i just do what i do with every other tv showmovie of books i love and compartmentalise them into separate things the characters are somewhat different from their book selves but from what you can see from the first season it allows greater character development to occur that is more fit for the tv screen i loved the inconclusion of marina a minor character from the th book in the series based on eloise story it added extra depth to the seriesi have a history degree and read voraciously so yes im aware of the historical inaccuracies however im also aware this is a work of fiction a delightful romp through a somewhat georgian period of english history with marriage minded mamas and men trying to avoid the parsons trap im not watching this looking for a history lesson and if you are youre doing life wrongthe use of poc actors is vaguely explained with a comment partway through the series to do with the king falling for a poc and marrying her thus making way for an inclusive society but to be honest i dont think it was necessary the best people for the roles have them despite comments on the woodenness of acting i think the casting is great particularly adjoa andoh for the society matriarch lady danbury nicola coughlan as penelope featherton and regéjean page as simon bassett the duke of hastings the actors do a great job of injecting life into the scriptthe only character i was unsure about the changes for was daphne  she is younger in the show than in the books in her first season rather than her second i think some of daphnes depth is lost due to this book daphne was beautiful but men quickly saw her as a friend something to do with growing up in the country with  older brothers and being particularly close to colin her closest in age she wasnt desperate to marry and indeed new she didnt have to the bridgerton viscountancy wad thriving and if any daughters chose not to marry they would always be supported but did want children thus concocted a scheme with simon to have her seem more desirable turning her into someone who cares about not much more than making the best match does the witty gracious character from the books a huge disservice losing some of her close relationship with her older brothers too i feel like her character is the only real change from the book that i take issue with hopefully they can keep a little more true to the essence of the brigderton family characters for any additional series and their own stories
i really hope im missing some big trick here and no one is genuinely taking this seriously please tell me for my own sanity that viewers at least realise its absolute trash as either a romance or a drama but go along with it for the pompous costumey ridehistorical accuracy is out of the window but as it is fiction thats fine but woe be all of us if our media consumption returns to the boobs and swords era of the late noughties that this series mindnumbingly revitalisesthe age rating certification given to this  actually surprised me mainly due to the fact that anyone of viewing age or above shouldnt find anything contained in it as exciting novel shocking nor interestingsniff
overally i really enjoyed this show i binged it in like two days i have a toddler otherwise it would have been in one day and was thoroughly upset when it was donesome of the intimate scenes are a little intimate lol but the plot characters acting etc are all really goodthe cast plays really well together and i truly felt as though i was in thisi would recommend but if you are shy with intimate scenes beware and have your fast forward ready p
i started watching this series with moderate interest only to become enthralled with the story line and characters the personalities were very well done as well as the wardrobe with some creative liberties for the era i loved all the twists and turns in the story as well as how their struggles within were portrayed the intimate moments with the lead characters were in the looks but the magical moment showed up in their first dance and was reinforced with their last dance there are a few spirited surprises so heads up whoever came up with the hair creations for the queen i applaud you for your creativity as they are works of art i as well as several people who have watched it found it very entertaining to watch and are eagerly waiting for season  which can not come soon enough congratulations to cast and crew for an excellent jobi gave this a  because of some of the wardrobe on the mother with the  girls it was a little over the top with the garrish fabrics i get what was trying to be portrayed but it could be toned down a bit and still get your point across
i really like the book series and this first netflix season book   does justice to the feeling of reading them romantic beautiful sweet moment funny dialogues and heartwarming about a delightful family nicely done genuine romance feeling and a big i like looking forward to more
not great but very good i binged all episodes on xmas day i will watch this series again please give me more adaptions of romanceromantic science fiction please the well to choose from is very deep
"it is based on the series of books by julia quin  but apparently its got nothing to do with the books even though i found enjoyable the drama the romance the outfits were amazing the decorations
i recommend for romance lovers"
this is a teen approach to a period drama or maybe an american approach it matter the fact is that many of the main characters are not well casted some of them would be perfect choices for eastenders or coronation street but not for a period drama really it reminds me of the typical high school american series but set in the th century the behaviour of the characters is not credible to put is simply the plot such a cliché when i heard ariadna grande and maroon  in the background played by violins i couldnt stand more of it preposterous not credible at all and julie andrews voiceover as if all of it was wisteria lane i needed a gt after approximately  min of it if i watch the full series i would become an alcoholic
i read this book many years ago and can see why julia quinns series would be made into a tv series i am glad it has been developed a bit more as times have changed and character backstories have more depth its like the easy beach reads have had a chilling adventures of sabrina glow up i have no issue with the diverse actors used as they all act well and the female characters while understanding their role in life making good marriage connections and producing heirs they mostly understand and strive for more i like the use of modern music dances and costuming which together make the series feel modern the broody rakeish type is a bit repetitive and yet we still love that plus regéjean page gets topless stand outs are adjoa andoh lady danburynicola coughlan penelope and claudia jessie eloise are brilliant too
"i decided to take the time to write a review as i was surprised and shocked by all the bad reviews ive just read i absolutely loved this series
maybe im lucky that i dont know much about history i didnt even consider it to be linked to real history it was a just a story in a different world
i think all actors were great and i loved the tension between the people in love and that the love scenes werent just cut or not shown
i really got into the story and enjoyed every minute of it until the end it was difficult to switch off after an episode as i needed to know what was going to happen next
i also enjoyed to look at the beautiful dresses and clothes
i havent read the book and didnt have any expectations when i started watching maybe thats the best way i highly recommend it"
yes it is a show not more but i enjoyed every piece of it i didnt read the books so had no expectations but i loved the story i loved the diversity in the cast the utopian fantasy of having people of colour occupying high ranks at those times for me was genius if only we could change the past very entertaining just what i needed for a relaxing sunday while my husband watched his football
i can understand the criticism its not even close to being historically accurate but the historical vibe is present and it adds a fun aspect to an otherwise teen drama i also do enjoy their versions of modern songsthere is some social commentary about misogyny and class race issues are ignored which i kind of like because it lets us see actors that we might not have otherwise seen in those type of rolesthe cast is very attractive the casting customer and acting are excellent most of the characters are three dimensional and the story is interesting
i dont understand the negative reviews here surethis is silly and trivial but its fun the writing is excellent production values are first rate character development is top notch and the acting leaves nothing to be desired its jane austen with saucy bits whats not to like
i feel embarrased that the bridgerton story would hide the truth behind this era it is like the british version of song of the south i assume the producer writers etc want to sanitize an era of history and inequality so it is obliterated and no one will ever reflect on the lessons of history if it was entertaining that would make it a little bearable obvious intent to revise history so that people forget the reality why do some writers think that people of color are so desperate to integrate into alternate history people dont deserve this level of pandering this show probably did not need to be made at all and if so it should have at least been more intelligently written
everything from the cast to the costumes to the plot was just wonderful things are always bound to change in adaptations and in this case for the better casting for simon and lady danbury in particular were marvelous choices i am so very glad this show has been created and look forward to seeing many more seasons to come that will depict all the other bridgerton books
im a huge fan of period dramas ive watched all tv and film adaptations of jane austens novels and other classic period pieces so when i heard about a new show set in regency england i knew i had to watchyears ago i also read the book series by julia quinn on which this series is based and even if i dont remember everything this has always been my favorite of the lot and the one i remember the mostwhile not exactly the same i believe this is a very faithful adaptation at least in spirit and i loved every second of it the actors the costumes the sets the music everything was excellent and vibrant indeed this series reminded me of the movie emma which came out last year and was a more modern racier adaptation of the beloved austen classic i appreciate the use of a diverse cast and dont understand what the fuss is about really all the actors were great particularly the actress playing lady danbury and now i cant imagine reading the books again without picturing them in my mind i really hope they continue adapting the other books tooin conclusion this was a beautiful sweet funny sexy show that i highly recommend to all the fans of period dramas and books forget about historical accuracy and just enjoy the show for what it is you will not regret it
i really enjoyed this serie great acting a great storynever a dull moment a story told with humor depth and warmth for all the caracters
this is such a great show the best ive seen this christmas season shonda rhimes certainly knows how to tell a great story the cast is fantastic regejean page is to die for and the chemistry between he and daphne is perfect ive seen some reviews that say the show is shallow pretty but insubstantial and i havent seen anyone mention where the real substance comes from its the unbelievable situation of the women of the times they didnt know how babies were made incredible they had no idea what happened on their wedding night ludicrous this is as feminist a story as shonda has ever toldi was actually brought to tears when daphne told her sister eloise that she believed she would make her own way in the world its so sad to me that we have been kept down for so very long i applaud ms rhimes and her excellent producer chris van dusen for giving us a beautiful lighthearted comedydrama that also speaks out on female disenfranchisement bravo
a fictional book series complaints about inaccuracy too much sex and more are so ridiculous as its fiction not a freaking documentary and they are following at least partially the book series  wowsa some of these reviews are preposterousmy take its not perfect there is an air of cheesiness but i thought some actors were amazing others were questionable but it did not affect the plot or anything the diversity of the cast of characters is refreshing even if historically inaccurate they discuss it explain it and give it reason sometimes shows try this and act as if the characters are not diverse as if the watcher should imagine there are no differences however this show discusses it rather plainly and i like it being addressed plus any show that celebrates diversity im willing to try  doesnt mean i or anyone will like them all but supporting those productions helps to ensure there will be more
"if shonda rhimes chris van dusen or whoever was responsible this series wanted to write a fictional regency love story that covered race class and any other issue that plagues us in  then they should have made up something of their own instead they took a wonderful series with such lovely characters and storylines and ruined it im on episode  and i recognize no one and nothing from the novels its breaking my heart honestly the storylines characters and actors are just awful and im struggling to watch this mess i loved the novels and i truly hate this series i dont know if i can even finish just plain awful
do not waste your time"
an absolutely exceptional season that opens up the world of bridgerton to greater explore the family history and dynamics along with the towns people the addition of kate and edwina sharma only create a fresh story that plays out in beautiful and dramatic fashion most especially simone ashley and jonathan bailey as kate and anthony give a new definition to chemistry and the slow burn that pays off in the end they are exquisite together and absolutely mesmerizing this is a must watch for fans
series   stars this series was almost perfect i initially found the diversity a little jarring because it didnt make any sense regardless i got sucked in and then was provided with something of an explanation mid way thru which honestly was such a clever manoeuvre without punching you in the face with social messaging an example of show me dont tell me current programs are so horribly lacking the love story was so entirely gripping the characters all introduced so well it was excellentseries   stars this series was a bit of a disappointment the female lead kate was actually pretty unlikeable she seemed unnecessarily rude abrasive and selfish i think the aim was her being fiercely independent but it played out as her being a bit of a btch it lost the show me dont tell me because we had to repeatedly be told shes so nice so selfless but we never saw it and secondly the chemistry between her and anthony was a bit hit and miss i ended the series unsoldseries  so far  stars the series between pen and colin are excellent so far the only downside is anthony and kate i was forgiving of kate delivering lines badly and without natural cadence the first time round but it is like she has never read a single novel of the time period and delivers lines like a high school presentation every single time its actually painful it she says vi count ess one more time i might actually scream
this series is perfect it has a lot of representation it was very well prepared all the people in front and behind the cameras are to be congratulated the work exceeded all my expectations i look forward to the next seasons 
"i cried so much and clapped my hands and squealed like a little child watching this 🤣 we absolutely enjoyed this show i watched it with my mom and aunt and we couldnt stop watching we stayed up until am to finish it
i absolutely loved seeing simon and daphnes story unfold seeing their emotions and all of the drama how fantastic and my god those are  extremely gorgeous people 😍😍
this show brought so much emotions out i havent cried and laughed so much in awhile watching a show it was just absolutely so well done the cast was wonderful they all played their parts so well this is such a unique and beautiful show its all about humans and connections family relationships love fears it is truly about us i cant wait to rewatch it and relive all of the special and intimate moments life is about the connections we make and the people we love so i will never be tired of seeing shows and films that celebrate this natural part of life i also cant wait to see what little bits i might not have noticed the first time around
but aside from all of that i have to say eloise stole the show for me this girl is ah maze zing just wow like i have no words for this girl she has stolen my heart ❤ i would say my top most favorite moments were involving any of these eloise peneloise polin anthony penelope and sir phillip i lived for these moments i also adored seeing benedicts parts he is wonderful and cute and funny him and colin interacting was great 😂😍 and i loved any mention of their father and the emotions it brought i loved hearing any little back story from the bridgertons and i hope we get a ton more next season i also totally loved seeing the bumble bee snippets how extra this was just so fun and so well done if you havent watched it do so there are so many ways in which people can relate to what these characters go through and deal with its an emotional and beautiful roller coaster"
"honestlyi dont know what i expected before actually seeing bridgerton but it exceeded my expectations on so many levels i am a big fan of jqs novels and never have i ever before seen a world from a paper so beautifully transferred to screen all the emotions the casting choices the chemistry the humor while keeping the soul the novel has i am speechless and still recovering from everything i felt when watching it this is honestly the first adaptation where i cant say i wish theyd done something differently
if you are looking for a historically accurate story then move along from this one how one can pay attention to skin color next to every beautiful detail this story is interwoven with is beside me
will definitely be watching many times again as i am not ready to leave this world quite yetnot sure ill ever be
thank you shonda rhimes and chris van dusen for this work of art"
the first season was outstanding to say the least with intricate plots and interesting character development anthony was definitely one of my favorites in season  just watched season  and it honestly did not even feel like the same show the shots were a little gimmicky at times and the lines too i also did not like how the two main characters of the season kate and anthony did not even get the proper attention they needed as a viewer i felt very underwhelmed and disconnected from their characters for some reason they really gave more screen time to characters i dont care to watch
omggg im in love with this show i binge watched it in one day i love them diverse cast and the plot i dont want to say to much but i really hope they have a second season
i particularly found the series fantastic i loved the diversity of the cast and i think this is just fiction so its ok to change things that didnt happen at that time after all the story portrays a novel and not a historical fact
amazing show thats how book should be adapted it was highly addictive and very juicy i cannot wait for that second season
the casting was perfect simon wink is dreamy it is a must watch and read
i loved the cast the details are excellent i loved the diversity in the choice of actors an incredible soundtrack
i barely got through first  episodes its a disaster writing acting everything it reminds me of mexican soaps although its more boring lol how this show has a rating  i will never understand i gave it  just because i can use it as a background noise for sleeping
i love an enemy to lovers romance so cant go down too hard on this season i thought it was off to a promising start but then petered out a bit first of all i love the bright and lush production design and im a sucker for regency fashion points for that i thought the actor playing anthony was quite good and seemed sincere but didnt tip over into soap opera land he was quite compelling alas the miss sharma actress could not match him its like she didnt know how to express herself or show nuance or archness so shes just shake her head or move her arms around bummer she is beautifulalso didnt welcome seeing daphne from season  what a boooooring character with little charisma please can she go on permanent holiday i do like the eloise characters is it just me or is she doing a british emma stone colin is a stuffed shirt and i dont look forward to more of himi liked the bridgerton matriarch and queen performances this season as well i do hope the next seasons improve upon the books i tried to read the eloise book recently and couldnt finish it i like the commoner romance story for her also when do we get a queer bridgerton seems like benedict was heading that way but maybe not perhaps two bridgerton sibling romances could be done in one season
those complaining of woke historical inaccuracies should also point out that the characters should all have rotten teeth and small pox scars all over their faces but that is ok for them
are you kidding me ok everyone has a right to their opinion coloured the only coloured people on this earth are white we go green with envy red with anger white with shock etc etc etc this to me was an absolutely fantastic yarn it bugs me that there is a shameful history no one is proud no one is innocent no one can erase history and no one should try but for goodness sake go with the flow and just enjoy a fantastic blooming entertaining show this is not a political platform still shocked that coloured was excepted
it is such a bingeable show this show makes you care about the characters and treats them like real people the set design and the locations of this show are gorgeous it is so entertaining and i am so excited for season 
"no need to take it so serious its pure fun and colorful
yes its not going to be a golden globe winner but sometimes you just want a light and fun tv series
perfect for lockdown "
something went sideways with season  if youre expecting the raw passion attraction emphasis on attraction and energy from season  which was phenomenal by the way prepare to potentially be sorely disappointedi was aware beforehand there would be less sexually charged scenes but reports alluded to this season being steamy it was anything but regardless that wasnt the issue there was just no chemistry generally speaking and everything fell flat im clearly not the only one that noticed see other reviewsthe facial expressions body language voice inflections and timing were more miss than hit and thus season  was full of awkwardness and miscues and completely missed the mark maybe its a director issue who knows its a mystery i care not to waste time investigating and i repeat im not the only one that noticed thispart of it was the casting chandran and ashley im sorry to say were illfitted for their roles perhaps this particular rhimes adaptation of the sharmas just didnt click as intended it all seemed very forced and is so far away from the book its almost criminal good intentions for diversity per rhimes marie claire interview but it failed abysmallyi would have given  stars but taking some off for this catastrophe called season  one extra star for golda rosheuvel who btw is delightful perfectly cast as queen charlotte and is a joy to beholdlets hope some lessons have been learned and that season  will right this ship
this wonderful and romantic book series has been beautifully brought to life in the bridgerton series as someone who has read the books over and over again the introduction to the bridgerton family was so cleverly done they took the over lapping timelines from the various books into the series and set into motion each characters personalities and laid the groundwork for their eventual love story daphne and simon were played so well whether they were flirting fighting or tearing each others clothes off i laughed cried and swooned as i binged all  hours in a row i cant wait to watch it again and this was such a wonderful christmas present and a  highlight
its not as bad as you think i knew that this was some modern pop culture kind of downtown abbey comparable but i thought that daphne and simons chemistry was unmatched forthere are some bad side character stories and some good ones  anthony and siena was an example of a good story where older brother anthony refuses to marry his long time mistress and depends on his younger brothers to do the marrying and his mistress later leaves him because shes done being treated like a doormatand then there are bad side character stories like eloise and finding who lady whistledown is i think the revelation at the end spoiler that her best friend penelope featherington was the culprit all along was more disappointing than anything else in the showi thought simons childish antics about not having children as revenge against his father was silly but penelope being lady whistledown was sillier thats literally the only reason why i cannot give it  starsthe show is probably worth watching for simon and daphnes relationship and chemistry daphne is innocent and new on the market while simon is a rake its interesting to see how she learns the world of having children as the shows goes on i think my favourite person on the show is lady danbury though hands down
i watched the entire season in one day hope season  will follow
"i read a lot of bad reviews about this serie and i dont really understand that i really liked it
i did not read the books so im not aware of the similarities or the lack of them
but to be honest i dont care
the diversity is really refreshing the costumes and settings are amazing and its very well acted ive seen soooo much worse
so people who give points as  or  are haters in my eyes that have very few respect
never has a movie been a perfect copy of the book there are more than enough examples best examples for me are lotr harry potter 
nevertheless the movies are jewels on their own way
you can read and watch and try to find the mistakes or you can just sit back relax and enjoy with an open mind
the choice is totally yours"
"this series was everything it was addicting from the very first episode on and i binged it in less than a day so so good i highly recommend it
the characters are brilliant i will definitely read the books and hope for another season of this amazing show"
the first time i watched i made it through  minutes its so historically inaccurate i knew it would be too painful to continue then i read a piece in oprah magazine that said to look at it as a fantasy movie so it doesnt need to realistic i watched again with that in mind but after making it to the fourth episode that time it occurred to me why does it just change some of the historical fact why not also change gender roles why not change everything and they can just show the characters behaving as if they were born in  how far should we take the fantasy we cant rewrite history no matter how much the woke brigade would like to
i enjoyed this series for what it is pure escapism not historically correct but fun with great acting quirky characters and a good story that had me engaged till the end
this is wonderful escapist alternate universe fantasy its based on a series of romance novels the most ridiculous and popular genre ever it follows its own set of rules just like a chinese martial arts movie when fighters fly through the trees just admit you cant deal with black people in high social positions and get over it its not historically accurate duh the costumes and sets are wonderful women get to enjoy sex and everyone lives in a silly strict social order that is very true i think its perfect pandemic entertainment
well i finished both of the seasons in  days im very embarrassed to day that lmfao after finishing the first season and saw that simon was no longer part of the cast on the second i debated whether i should even start it or not then read lots of reviews saying its very boring i gave it the benefit of the doubt since the first one did not disappoint me once but it literally is not boring at all the second seasons main cast literally carried each episode and it was so good i cant wait for the third one already
"for the first half of episode  i was trying to figure out the diversity in casting of the queen duke of hastings and rest of the cast however by the end of episode  i was hooked and had fallen in love with the story and acting quite different than the books bridgerton the neflix series has more influences of today  contemporary songs remade with orchestra pieces  that help set the tone and the mood of the story
this is a smart and updated version of bridgerton with lead characters who carry it off quite elegantly
i am already waiting for season  i will admit i watched three episodes in a row and then picked it back up later in the day as soon as i had a chance
if i would suggest anything it would be i that the show should have given the explanation of why the diverse cast works in the bridgerton world from the beginning in the first episode instead of explaining it in later episodes"
the adaptation didnt lose the essence of the series its changes were not bad the cast is perfect i loved it
splendidly and beautifully shot costumes and acting award winning netflix will sweep award ceremonies ma rainey and now this both of these masterpiece in the same year from the same entertainment company netflix is legitimately the king of entertainment i bringe watched entire  season in  hours im bored already awaiting for season 
this series is so freaking amazing i got the feeling as if i were in this era all through the episodes from the costumes to then characters the love story and just everything about it a must watch
this show is fabulous escapism exactly what we need right now as for the bad reviews cmon people this is fiction wonderful delightful gorgeous happy fiction cannot wait for season 
"i love ❤ this show
not because of story but starcast also
miss bridgeton  mr simon hasting and danbury shows greatest performance
story line is perfect
not bored at any time
i love the romance 💏💏💏💏 of beautiful ages group"
ive never heard the word ton so much in my life prior to watching this the only time id heard it was to mean fashionable in cryptic crosswords rather than fashionable societyhigh society the aristocracy here leading strings is another rare and outdated expression that refers to a babys reins the cheesy dialogue doesnt stop ones enjoyment though nor does the surfeit of wigs on display wigs having become rare after the tax on wig powder introduced in  and the racial situation though i do note the hypocritical reaction that would ensue if plays went back to having white people playing othelloi enjoyed watching this if only to see who the mysterious gossiping lady was in the end the silly pledge the duke of hastings made to his his father is an unconvincing plot device but even that is a source of amusement and allegedly appears in the bookall in all this shouldnt be taken too seriously or rated too highly but is entertaining enough to merit an  out of 
"this serial looks pretty and appeared to promise an interesting new angle on regency period drama in the same vein as the knights tale and medieval england but it turned out to have major flaws above all the sheer quantity of gratuitous soft porn sex scenesmaybe this works in a certain segment of the us market but i doubt that it will please a more discerning uk and european audience i could eventually accept some of the many glaring anachronisms eg offenbachs belle nuit in  but why on earth use the very well known real name of cliveden with locations which are quite patently nothing to do with that place
period fantasies can work well for example the contrast between bridgerton and the wonderful harlots series is massive hard to believe a second season is apparently to be dredged up bright points were some of the acting performances notably the duke and duchess of hastings lady danbury and the duchesss mother"
idiots to those who criticize this series i love it and its awesome  just watch it with open minds and appreciate the actors
if you like me are into anything jane austen has originally written and that features keira knightley then youll love this sure it is not historically correct and all that but it is so entertaining and left me with such a happy feeling in me hoping for a second season since it did end on a continuous note btw simon is the best looking guy ive probably ever seen soooo
so many colourful characters and scenery to take in it comes across as less of a tv series and more of a theatre production which is brilliant i also loved the subtle nods to fairy tale characters think cinderella ugly step sisters a visually beautiful show to watch but the chemistry between basset and daphne is believable and you really want them to succeed suspend any uppity notions of how a proper regency era drama should be done and think more along the lines of the incredibly successful broadway show hamilton have fun
im not really a big fan of period dramas but im in love with the show
season  is far far better that season one amazing acting by jonathan bailey simone ashley is beautiful her acting could be better in some places but overall loved her the slow burn in this season was everything binged it multiple times already it definitely makes you feels those intense moments breathtakingly a must watch for all
very disappointed bad acting and the actors are totally devoid of presence and charm therefore there is no chemistry there is no passion there is no beauty everything very badly done it seems that i am watching an open tv show for teenagers ridiculous
"it has truly make me feel a full spectrum of emotion and ive looked forward to the next episode more and more
ive now finished the first season and loved every minute i cant wait for another season
this isnt my usual genre of entertainment and i watched thinking it probably wouldnt be my cup of tea but by the rd episode i was hooked give it a chance its worth it"
"loved it i am a fan of the book but i love the slight changes of the content which made the series more dramatic but also more worthy to watch the love story is brilliant the characters are nicely described with their own flaws which somehow more realistic than in the book
loved the modern music whenever i hear them i laugh a lot"
brilliant brilliant brillianti cant say enough about this series i binged the whole  episodes excellent writing and amazing performances stars isnt enough cant wait for next series
i really loved this its a wonderful love story full of drama and pride and a lot of love in many ways i binged it in two days and will see it again for sure
loving it so far read all the books and this is such an enjoyable show
this show was such a bore i have no idea how it got high reviews one of the worst shows ive seen to date
ok i was shocked at the beginning i must confess it was like why why i love period dramas and the inclusion of people of color in those roles was not realistic and made me think of a bad joke but i decided to give it a go nothing better to do today and oh my god once you have watched  mins you are just captivated by it i bing watched it and rewatched again cause it is a beautiful story music is great to die for outfits and the acting cast just wonderful actors also beautiful what a great show vibrant colorful exceptional
im not a huge fan of historical drama if im honest they usually pass me by however there was absolutely nothing good to watch over christmas and my friends were raving about bridgerton so i thought id give it a whirl i am so glad i did well acted sublime soundtrackmusical score generally just an amazing watch i was hooked from start to finish i would recommend it to everyone
everything about the story the costumes the places actors the chemistry was amazing the queen is the most unforgettable queen character i have ever seen on tv  loved every detail of her cant wait for season 
how i describe this beautiful showseries is flawlessthe costumes and sets are stunning the actors are fantastic each different to the othereverything flows together beautifully and the locations and buildings are stunningnothing but a  here
mix of historic fiction with modern style gossip girl cross reference fun funny romantic and filled with mystery i like that it is different from other shows very creative great actors and script beautiful costumes and music is creative mixed with modern with hint of classical such as billie ellish marron five etc highly recommend
i was going to give this a chance until a heard a string quartet version of ariana grandes thank you next it was then that i realized this is just some silly cheap series targeted to younger viewers no thank you next
beautiful sets and costume enjoyable plot with plenty of twists unfortunately some people are offended by black people appearing on screen its funny given that most period dramas have numerous inaccuracies from dates to storylines but apparently these dont matter at all strange its almost like they have a hidden agenda
i was still am literally obsessed with this show no surprise its listed top show from the first episode i was glued to the screenacting script locations costumes and so on are totally stunning i love the different characters that you just get to loveunequivocally an extraordinary show
"great seriesto the readers and reviewers do you really remember any of the other characters in this series other than simon and daphne
i believe this is the first time ive ever seen an interracial couple in a drama series as captivating and believable as these two they really seem to be in love with each otherthis show is a fun fictional depiction of england during the late s as it should have been  people of different races thriving and simply getting alongthis show offers comedy romance and mystery the one possible negative could be the sex scenes some sex scenes are a bit revealing so you may need to cover the little ones eyes for a bit i liked themi definitely recommend this series you will not be bored"
there are eight episodes of the bridgerton series each are very good chapters just like a book you are gripped and this is what good writing and of course acting should dobridgerton is funny very daring exhilarating and i love the costumes and musicthere are a number of actors that really stand out and who are funny and natural but all the cast were very good
didnt know this was based on a book but gosh i binged the show and i love it so muchi dont know why people are bashing on the acting but its top notch just like everything else about it
political correctness at all costs nothing to say more
bridgerton has reached no  overall on netflix in  countries as a matter of fact it has made the top  in all  countries that netflix is available in save one japanfacts are above i think its amazing i cant wait for the next season and people who dont like the show i really dont know how are narrow minded or did you audition and didnt get the part makes me wonder what is going on with the negativitytop show
i have just completed all the episodes of the amazing bridgerton the most heavenly series ive ever watchedeach character is unforgettable especially some of the main charactersi cried i laughed and am so excited for whats next
"words couldnt possibly explain how much in love i feel with this tv series where do i begin the story the directing the clothes the places chosen the actors ok one or two could have better performances but the final result is so magnificentto make this critic basic though and in the same time as honest as its gets it reminded of this pop song lyric i am mad at disney they tricked me had me wishing on a shooting star and thats exactly what this piece of movie art made to me i was on my toes during every episode i gasped so many times it made me believe again and dream and it even make me hope againin case you wonder about the reason why i am mad its because of the fear of never living this dream they created some may disagree some may want different things but in my eyes this is the kind of love i seek and value getting over the difficulties and falling in love with the real self even the flawed one
but please dont take this in the wrong way these series were not a cinderella movie it was speaking truth and thats exactly what makes you fall over heels in love with it the fact that you can see parts of yourself in every single character and feel their needs lust passion feelings while opening a window to the pastanyway everyone who has worked for this amazing creation should be proud for what they have made and i and i am sure many many many others wait for more"
bridgerton is just perfect there is great representation in the cast the wonderful story impeccable soundtrack i only have praise for this wonderful work
the show creators did a wonderful job adapting the book for the screen this was more than i expected for a regency romance book turned tv show i cant wait for more
what an absolute load of drivel historical inaccurate terrible acting boring storyline no doubt ms rhimes is just trying to rewrite history by showing pocs in high society the only pocs were waiting on the rich white folks the conversations are completely boring this is just an attempt at wokeism do yourself a favor and give this a miss
this show will not disappoint you it has romance drama scandal and the most amazing cast the writing is superb and so is the production and music there is nothing disappointing about the show a must watch for sure  and i hear there are more seasons cant wait
i only watched this because some friends had posted on social media about it i dont typucally care for sappy drama and im not a huge fan of period pieces i have never seen downton abbey with all that said i totally got sucked into this story the characters are well thought out and i loved the drama between daphne and simon
compelling new series and the best i have seen a while on the amazing neflix the proof is in the fact its already no in many countriesthe cast have done an amazing job all actors played their parts really welllooking forward to more seasons
i dont understand why people hate this who cares if its accurate or not its a tv show if you want accurate watch a documentary i loved downton abbey and this show is amazing
"season  review a special place in my heartok so im writing this whilst in episode  forces of nature i was hoping i could watch this earlier in the evening but as a lawyer i work late i thought id watch  episode then go to bed after starting this at pm but i just cannot stop watching lukes acting in this episode is fantastic the moment at the end between pen and colini rewinded several timesi wasnt sure how id find this season initially i was excited but the marketing was overkill because anyone whos read the book knows how awesome polins story is i mean its the book ive read most out of the bridgerton series so my view was how could you not know what date their season was and not being excited to watchhowever over the top the marketing was the romance and the beautiful moments between penelope and colin is warming my heart and making me cry happy tears i can only imagine how i will feel once i get to part  and after all the nuances and changes in their love story and their relationship dynamicluke newton and nicola coughlan are brilliant in this i knew they would smash it and they absolutely have romancing mr bridgerton is my favourite story from julia quinns fantastic bridgerton series so ive read this book several times especially cause we were forced to wait  years and know all the special polin moments and whilst some variables have changed they have kept key moments inthis is romcom heaven romance and comedy i cant stop smiling or laughing especially with the beautiful awkwardness i knew nicola could do comedy from derry girls check it out if you havent but love that both her and luke are brilliant with their comedy and awkwardness as penelope and colin it just fills my heart and makes my mouth hurt with smilingi will write again after watching part  its challenging to review each season of bridgerton but bridgerton has reminded me what it was like to be a teenager and love something passionately even though im in my s im still a teen a hearti love polins story i was curious about how graphic they would make the carriage scenei thought it was modest compared to the book but still good i like how they switched some of the lines ie colin said what pen said once the carriage stoppedbut i always love the carriage scene i liked their versioni love the passion that comes when polin argues similar to the fiery passion that kanthony has so looking forward to seeing that in part all in all part  for me is   point is deducted for splitting the season into  and making me wait  month and knowing that i will want to sit through and watch the show all thought againbut thats really a delight instead of a chore however if it wasnt splitnot sure how id fare at work tomorrow at least this way i get some sleepluke and nicola were the cast is cant wait to see the second half of polins love story and see everyone else develop also the rest of the cast is brilliant as always but maybe we havent had as many bridgerton family momentsi mean the pall mall scene in season  is excellent as is the dancing scene so whilst i love the focus of polins love story i also hope we get to see more moments of everyone together i enjoyth featherington moment im a big fan of portia and love every scene shes in i feel the same for queen charlotte lady danbury lady violet bridgerton so lets keep all their scenes cominghannah dodd as francesca is excellentthey really brought out her character traits in this season and i was remembering bits from her season claudia is outstanding too showing her compassion for all these complicated characters shes friends witj i never had a problem with her being friends with cressidai like that she sees the heart in her whilst still loving pen even though shes pissed at her but then i like a complex character its the same reason i like penelope also seeing colin grapple with his emotions and showing the angry side of colin truly outstanding nicola is the beautiful smart girl and represents all us smart girls she was superb and i just want her to be happy i cant wait to see fully happy polin after theyve overcome all their obstacles love this show so much next time we dont need the marketing rammed down our throats  people who knows it great know its great people who havent heard must be living under a rockok my rant is overlets go part  also at the end of episode  i was literally on my feet watching with excitement  its that good and beautifully actedseason  was brilliant better than season i didnt think bridgerton or the writers could do it i didnt think they could make me love anthony and root for his love story as he was my least fave character in season  but boy was i wrong i was a hardcore fan of simon and daphne but theyve been eclipsed by my love and rooting for anthony and kate once i got to episode i had to watch the rest of this season asap and probably did so in a night and a bit which wasnt great for my working from home schedule ive not read any of the books but i will order this one i just adore their love story and their conflict with their sense of duty to their family contrasted with their own personal desire and love for each other which i can absolutely relate to im an avid fan of austen books and possibly an even greater fan of the variations i mean i also like to see what pp would be with sex in it anthony and kates story reminded me of a combination of austen stories elizabeth bennett and mr darcy the lovehate romantic connection from pride  prejudice my fave austen book marianne and eleanor dashwood the sense and sensibility sisters both pursuing love with different dispositions and emma and harriet from emma  falling for the same guy in mr knightley and emmas conflict in respect of thisi watched the show in less then  days because i had a couple of busy work days but if i didnt work i would have watched it all in one sitting this show helped me recover from a headache thats how delightful it wasif i have one criticism i feel that we didnt get enough anthony and kate so naturally im going to rewatch immediately and also buy the book so i can learn every party of their love story also i hope we get to see more of their love in the next seasons considering kate is now lady bridgertonin terms of the other characters the bridgerton mum was fantastic portraying her grief and i loved every scene with her daphne and lady danbury plus all scenes where they were featured together look forward to seeing more of them in the latter seasons cause their also brilliant i too laughed hysterically at the wedding when violet bridgerton and lady danbury laughed after having no idea what to do next and when they tried to appease their queen who also put in a strong performance i did miss simon
initially and felt sad that we didnt get to see him and daphne together but we did see their cute child but lets be honest i was here for the great love story between anthony and kate and thats why im watching again and again which i did not do for season  only watched that once if i could have a condensed version of only their scenes together then that would be a truly great gift i think youtube will provide thisjonathan bailey and simone ashley were absolutely superb please lets see them in the latter seasons together or i will be truly sad i want more if their love story maybe i should check for a variation due to too much feathertons when i wanted more bridgerton scenes"
but disney castle in opening scene and words its a fairytale would add some sincerity to this hideous tv story
its like an adult nonmusical version of brandys cinderella though set in the past its not historical its a lovely story with rumors and drama a bit of gossip girl narration its a fun escape the costumes and sets are picturesque
the series in my opinion has more strengths than weaknesses like the great costume and the perfect soundtrack and the scenario wins over anyone and the actors choices would not change any from my point of view even the series being at the time i see no reason not to choose black actors for the roles of royalty since the stereotype that black actors can only play slaves or butlers does not help in the fight against racism today my opinion
i was shocked at all the negative reviews this series was captivating to myself being one who gets fidgety i watched it in  days and hoping for a sequel this was written to entertain in a modern world which gave it more character and much fun to watch the sensual scenes were romantic and not morally inept like most love scenes this is my first movie review in my  years i was compelled to share my experience because it is a must see for everyone
its not just bad its shockingly bad i really tried to give it a chance by watching  cringeworthy episodes but found myself fastforwarding through more than i watched then finally gave up
"and i dont care everyone should put their brain in neutral and just sit back and enjoy the gossip the scandal and the lives of aristocrats from a past era however fictional it may all bevisually gorgeous finely drawn characters who one gets to choose their favorites personally i like lady bridgerton eloise and penelope the most daphne mainly from series  was likeable but a little jennifer love hewitt at times and one cant forget the characters one loves to hate
i also liked the effective use of the music mainly played at the balls string versions of songs written  years in the future material girl anyonei dont usually like this type of stuff much but i found this one of those rare shows that i actually looked forward to watching the next episode"
bridgerton made for entertaining watching and judged on its own its a delightful romance swathed in period taffeta jewels ornateness decorum and rule breaking the fictional story did some very interesting things in its narrative and some have panned that its inclusive casting and as i saw it a femalecentered if not feminist perspective and the claiming of female agency physical emotional and intellectual despite the constraints of conventional patriarchal norms i really liked that the lead female character dynevor was full of personality and worked hard to define herself for herself as much as possible going against the grain and forging her personal path through various challenges and setbacks she stands up for her emotionalromantic happiness and does not compromise or settle in the affairs of her heart which is a rather more modern notion dressed up in period costume the show lent itself to very interesting analyses by the choices it made and it posited some different perspectives that in a way reimagine history by setting it in a fiction genreie projecting a what if world vs a documentary what waswhat is one fantasy fiction or even historical fiction have plenty to offer on their own genres terms juat as does bridgerton
ive just binged watched this reading other reviews yes it wasnt historically correct so what it was different fun and entertaining and raunchy made me forget covid i think the negative reviews all have got lockdown fever
just as a simple story  this show is quite good  neat n clean set pieces and excellent chemistry between thr lead pair
this is truly a masterpiece after sitting through all seasons of downton abbey a few times and enjoying the formal dark and historically correct dramas on the countryside this series is the exact oppositecolorful city life full of decadence emotions and sex exploits everything left in the genre that has not yet been portrayed on screen it is witty dialogue combined with casual erotics over the top fashion and a bright mix of people of all colors and sizes posing in all society groupsit is truly a visual joy to watch and a breath of fresh air among historical dramas it mocks the diamond of the season the pretty main character girl who is usually made a perfectly composed vision of innocence tormented by the agony of love and the supporting roles have equally important and interesting storylinesif you are looking for a feelgood series with a fast moving story and exquisite enovironments and relatable characters this is your goto this is donwton abbey meets marie antionette goes postmodern bonanza
if you are into historical romanticism in a jane austenlike way and you dont mind a few modern twists then bridgerton is definitely the thing for you the settings are beautiful the costumes luscious the acting is top notch and the romantic entanglements are worthy of any of jane austens novelsthe already mentioned nowadays twists are reasonably modest but will nonetheless give historical purists probably much to nitpick about the too exuberant and colorful dresses of especially the featheringtons some of the anachronistically modern music that is played on balls or a queen who almost carelessly wanders among her subjects and meddles into their personal affairs and of course the thing that bridgerton became inmediately famous for the seemingly random dispersion among the characters be it aristocrats or servants of actors of all kinds of colour and ethnic background true it doesnt fit the factual circumstances in th century great britain but its a wonderful and laudable diversity statement of the makers that for me worked like a charmi still had some minor reservations both main storylines the romance and the hunt for lady whistledown are rather flimsy and seem to be dragged a bit out of proportions to fill up all the  episodes the romantic drama is at least entertaining but to be honest the whole lady whistledown plot is hardly interesting way too farfetched and actually became more and more tedious several tiny sub plots are only poorly worked out like the brother who wants to become a painter or came a bit out of nowhere and didnt lead to anything like the fraudulent featheringtonscheme and since diversity seemed to be such an important issue i kept hoping for a gay storyline with so many brothers in the bridgerton family maybe a nice thought for a next seasona last word of praise for the dialogues such strikingly beautiful english is spoken throughout all the episodes and by all characters its an absolute and rare treat
not worth watching what a disappointment netflix should use their money to produce better shows
if you want your fantasy to be realistic then you shouldnt be watching fantasy as a fan of the books and the author of the books i absolutely loved it ms rhimes version of the bridgertons except anthony i went in  expecting it to be more soap opera so of course it cant stay  faithful to the books it isnt supposed to be social commentary or a history lesson its supposed to be a fun escape which most stories are i only gave  stars because anthony wasnt such an ahole in the books but they sure got the pressure hes feeling exactly right i hope we get glimpses of the smithsmythe family in the next seasons cousins to the bridgertons i feel sorry for those who cant just enjoy something without having to nitpick it to death to be edgy
bridgerton is a great series fun easy watchingsome critic saying it is historically incorrect and some what insult i feel take it far to seriously it is meant to be entertaining and never claims to be factual in anywaya mostly brilliant cast though the actress playing marina thompsons acting let down the era somewhat the character eloise a definite favourite lovely music and lovely story line my favourite thing is that the first season ends the story exactly where you would want it it completes the seasons story so youre no anxiously awaiting the next but still leaves you wanting more
"for the sheer attention to nuance that the maker works out to the screen and of course the characterization which is removed from complacency and expediency not to mention the tired orthodoxy i think this is the best gift art could ever have given us in the covid lockdown of  kudos to netflixthe haters hate for this masterpiece is almost predictable they are fatigued by the lockdowns nothing fascinates them anymore and shondaland for a second thought could do just that  bring a little sunshine to everyones darkness  only for these angry ones to unleash their bad energy  albeit they watched all eight of them episodesclearly the show was no documentary about british royalty which is what is pissing people off  bridgertons only a work of fiction and who is saying anything about political correctness
english royalty is no deity it can and should be twisted and stretched to as far as poetic license allowsand actors of color can pull off that task too its not and should not be just affirmative action that would be weird the times simply demand freshness and reimagination and so did bridgerton splendidly reinventing the presentation of british royaltyfor accurate accounts of the olden days of british society i am positive in some future bbc will be working on the role of royalty in the expansion of the empire to australia and africa and how thus the people and cities of britain prospered and flourishedthen i might join the wagon too advocating passionately that stories be told as they exactly happened  with utmost accuracy  and full character and demeanor of all the charactersactors after all we will be doing history justice forget arts who cares for netflixs fantasieslastly interracial couples are a reality now in our society we should begin to accept them on screen already and in our reviews its not hollywood forcing them on us theyre part of us and theyre adorable couples stop frowning goshanyway at least now you know i read between the lines"
bridgerton in my opinion is a wonderful show a true delight from episode  to  this show is the perfect inspirational concept of a jane austen novel with gossip girl and it succeeds in that brilliantlyof course it applies modern themes which blend well with the story the production design is beyond belief as well as costumes cinematography and the amazing score the cast is also excellent the two leads are fresh and full of star power and theres the mystery of who is lady whistledown which is greatthere have been people saying that its not as good as downtown abbey or jane austens work or a decent disney movie but the show does not try to be that for me bridgerton is unique in its own right its like this show is a cupcake full of sugar sprinkles cream and chocolate filling its not for everyone but those who love it will
"i had no expectations and this came out
music 
characters 
chemistry 
feeling 
story "
hate that they have strayed so far from the booksthumbs down they should have stayed more true to the authors work and not change so much and the casting omg its one thing to be political correct on other showsbut cast coloured ppl as upper society in a show about th century england society is a bit to much no offence to dark ppli am all for divercety
"its quite fun as long as you dont take it too seriously
do pay attention to the music at the partiesballs  billie eilish maroon  shawn mendes celeste taylor swift 
a good distraction in these complicated times"
if you do not enjoy period dramas with a diverse cast that centre on romantic stories dont watch this show and then pretend to be horrified by it this is a shonda rhimes period drama and delivers exactly what you would expect plus a little more the script is quite good and the story is entertaining a bit of a breath of fresh air i recommend this show to its intended audience
and i loved every minute of it dont go into it with any higher expectations than that its a guilty pleasure for those who enjoy masterpiece theater but also watched vampire diaries when no one was looking it moves quickly and is the perfect binge watch already looking forward to season 
loved it costumes wonderful but im obsessing over who found the gorgeous necklace that prince frederich gave daphne she ran out of the ball and left it on a rock wall right before she met simon in the garden wtf
"wonderful and impeccable plot the casting was just perfect the black representation in the series was all good it was magnificent to see black characters as the protagonist
i love you bridgerton"
to those that say its not historically accurate a la the mixed cast i say so what it got me to imagining what an integrated world at the time might have meant for us now its emily in paris across the channel at an earlier time and i loved emily in paris the deeper you get into the story the more enticing and fun it becomes it goes without saying that the visuals are sumptuous but the scriptplot are fine as well too highly recommended
absolutely loved this show i love the connection between daphne and simon the chemistry between those actors is amazing the photography music selection that modern touch was like breathing fresh air the wardrobe and the color palettes for each family was so detailedperfect for binge watching  or  timesthank you shonda for giving us something great this 
this show is phenomenal the characters are interesting and have so much chemistry the storyline never got boring and was quite unpredictable the costumes were gorgeous and the music was perfect i loved that they used modern songs rather than all period songs i will say there are essences of gossip girl but much more realistic and without so much unnecessary repetitive drama i cant stop thinking about the show
the series is soooo perfectly put out with the storyline  the cast the acting and the love of simon and daphne also how the show brings into light various social issues along with it and how it showcases a family of bridgestons so happy together all in all its a complete and perfect comboi just loved it and personally i loved daphne and simon like anything
dont believe the  star ratings because i truly dont know what show they where watching is this historically accurate nope is this based on real life nope but what this is is great show the storyline will have you watching episode after episode acting is on point shonda rhimes created the longest running medical drama on tv is that  accurate nope but its entertaining as is bridgerton just watch it youll be happy you did
i definitely would not recommend immoral scenes and bad language truly disgusting could have been a good show but too much junk in it do not watch as a family or individual for that matter should be rated r
didnt know there were books but definitely going to be looking it up regèjean page and phoebe dynevor had an amazing chemistry binged watched the whole thing in one day
"hooked from the first episode and love the diversity amongst actorscharacters
a mix of downton abbey and gossip girl and it works"
so i hated season  beige  boring simon and daphane were done badly but this season  this book  much betterwhile the story told by shondaland is still not the book i know and love and consider the best version of the story this season netflixed re kate and anthony was a  improvement on last season yes you pathetically sex obsessed americans is not full of gratitous sex scenes  thank you powers that be no this season was emotional and dwelt on interpersonal relationshipsit was perfect i cried through every other episodewell done shondaland i now have hope heading into season  benedict  sophie
what i love most is the atmosphere great actors the colorful clothes and rooms the movie sweeps you away perfect and a nice kind of distraction in the present time simon is missing
do not give up on it as season  is far betterseason was okay season  was amazing engaging and not as graphic in terms of sex scenes great acting and love story that keeps you wanting more
nothing to see here in the reviews but white people having a problem with poc its funny that these same people dont have a problem with whites constantly telling historical stories about poc without poc dont listen to the bad reviews most of the people had a problem with diversity cloaked in historical bulls smh
"season more pomp less romp in season two new characters join the fray two sisters the older sister kate simone ashley sharma of sexed fame has apparently trained her younger sister in all that it is to be a good and dutiful wife  played by
edwina sharma charithra chandran who is now out to find herself a catchso far so good charithra is very pretty but unfortunately she looks about  years old unbelievably she is  years old in real life this makes for slightly uncomfortable viewing her acting is also a bit meh which jars a bit at times she is only saved in these scenes by her older sister simone ashley is stunning she has a face that you simply cannot ignore her dark skin and chiselled looks are made for the screen but it is her acting which steals the scenes for me i think simone is going to be a huge star after thisthe story line is thinly veiled if you want deep and meaningful then dont bother watching this is a lot of fun i have no idea why they decided to not have as much flesh this season but it is still very watchable"
"im a life long jane austen fan so am a sucker for regency drama but this was quite something else
the detail casting costumes use of current music cinematography humour and story line were superb
the chemistry between daphne and simon was delicious and so believable the range and diversity of characters kept my interest throughout but the traditional line of austens story telling was so apparent it was sublime well done to all involved"
the series did not disappoint at allthe main actors chemistry is fire and makes me want to see more all the characters were amazing the only thing was i didnt get why the featheringtons had all the problems in the series that was not fair when they  burn for each other as saidit was magnificent
after viewing this show i rated it  and while i usually doubt naysayers who compare a three show to books i have to agree with them here when reading the incredible source material the passably good show becomes awful it was predictable some of the characters were cliche and dull and the ending was uninteresting but overall i still found it to somehow be fun between a few decent actors and all the drama as predictable as it was the show itself was believable and there were a few emphasis on few enthralling momentsbut then i felt the need to pick up the books every single interesting second in this show is taken out of the book and made worse the dialogue in the books is always funny quick witted and interesting whereas the show did not have a single such moment the parts of the show that were added were all so strange yet boring that they actually detracted from the experience the characters are so much more complex with many more problems that are specific to them directly affecting their personalities yet the show rarely shows any of these problems instead focusing on their own added modern problems that add nothing to the stories instead sucking all the personality from the characters giving them little to like the show is still fine with the gossip lovers and the pretty good acting from several and the costumes that match the character descriptions alrighti do note that this show had to cram  romantic novels with different stories taking place over the course of many years or at different times all into one show with one timeline i can see how they tried to make things fit and it somewhat worked the show itself may not be very good but the fact that it is passable is an accomplishment perhaps not a great one but an accomplishment nonetheless
me and my friends enjoying season  very much and very excited for season after watch the show  we are constantly annoyed badly executed make it seems like the elder sister is seducing his sister datedaphne keep saying need to find someone make you exicited and challenging to marry the edwina is perfect wife  very peaceful with anthony why daphne say it is not challenging and exiting enough is she suggesting a toxic relationship that only argue all the time will be happy yet she also make the comment about having to find similarities before marry so did she  did she found any similarities with duke before marrying him season  logic is very different level with season  season  logic is very well although daphne did argue with duke but she still remain reasonable polite level kate is very rude with argue with anthonyi really hope it just stop at season  cause even daphne character become stupid and annoyed this time otherwise  the other brothers and sisters of bridgerton line  remain well
"everyone is seeking their soul mate and to end up marrying one is a blessing indeed
shonda rhimes and chris van dusen have achieved something in this era of popculture that is a rarity they have managed to bring forth a romance novel with a diverse caste not only that they were able to bring tunes from famous melodies harmonies and songs and wove them around the romance love it you will find many shows and movies that aim to do it and fail miserably but not shonda and chris
if you love jane austen novel where you always hope of lovers eventually findings each other then this one is sure for you there is some heartache there is some unrequited love but there is also great romance
dont even get me started on chemistry between duke and miss daphne bridgerton
their fights and their romance is expertly portrayed and something that you will find rarely in todays tv shows or movies
please be ready to get swept away by incredible background score by kris bowers
mixing a romance with incredible music is the way to do it and van dusen and kris bowers have hit it out of the park the production value is outstanding and equivalent to what one would expect from netflix
the intimate scenes and level of nudity is appropriate for a romantic portrayal between lead characters in my opinion and never feel gratuitous
i cant stress this enough it is awesome that in present times netflix shonda and chris were able to caste such a diverse group of actors actresses and were able to portray characters from regency era
this being a romantic show get ready to watch it again and again kudos to netflix shonda rhimes chris van dusen and team in bringing this period romance to screen cant wait for the next season and hopefully multiple future seasons keep them coming netflix"
"this is everything youd hope and wish for from shondaland its a modernised period drama with just enough of both to keep you hooked the costume and set designs are to die for the casting is perfection its beautifully done yes sure the storyline isnt what people report the books to be but for tv  this works in the same way the keira knightly version of pride and prejudice shook things up so has this
i adore it and have happily watched twice through already"
please ignore any review using the word woke or stating  i only watched the first episode this is a great period series that only gets better with each episode i am  episodes in and all i keep thinking is that i cant wait for season let us start with how beautiful it is the scenery the sets the costumesperfect it is steamy funny dramatic and the ever lingering mystery of the narrating gossip columnist could not be more engaging and no one can overlook the love scenesi found myself holding my breath a time or two😊 ignore the haters and low ratersthis is a fun one that many will enjoy
clearly it isnt meant to historical correct i enjoyed the show regéjean page is beautiful i also read the book and i actually liked the storyline of the show better there are more details and other perspectives i found interesting which is usually the opposite when it comes to book to show
so everyone loved season  but many are slating the second series because it doesnt focus on the same characters its a book adaptationspoiler each book is based on a different bridgerton sibling so it appears the show will followpersonally i love the books and the show i enjoy the changes theyve made to make the show more inclusive to ensure the other characters are more involved and i love the different tone of the show to mimic the different character typepeople need to stop whining because a show is actually following a book series
i do not know the books and came with expectations i do love a good period piece so seeing a diverse cast was odd to me at first it did raise eyebrows for me but then from the get go you clearly see that this isnt meant to be historical contemporary twist on classical music unrealistic plot etc and surprisingly it worked for me i got mesmerised by it and couldnt stop watching the characters are charming simons super hot daphne very cute the queen hell that really spelt it hey this is fantasy and meant to be fun its really really worked for me its colourful and wonderful for once actors of colour are not confined to playing servants and its a good change its fun its positive its well played its imaginative just give it a go
"great show tell about the love and romance
nice
great scene and great relationship between duke and duchess"
lets be honest season  was just okay but the intimate scenes were thrilling enough to make this show huge season  delivered on an actual love story tethered to actual character development jonathan bailey is superb he can deliver so much with the subtlest shift in an eyebrow or intensity in his eyes lots of haters out there because of the relative lack of sex and departures from the book but it was hot and passionate nonetheless and ultimately a touching real deal love story
though i do enjoy a love story i did not find the first season so very interesting and it felt rather forced to go through with it the second season however was such a delight that i could watch it again and again the storyline the character developments and the acting of the actors and actresses are much better and so is the love in the second season if one gives a chance to this series one must see both seasons before making their judgement or perhaps only the second one if the first one does not entertain and probably see queen charlotte first which i might have liked the most among all it would also make you understand the history and the qualities of the society presented in the series much better to first have seen queen charlotte before bridgertonbesides the wonderful love stories and sex scenes i also love the elegant way they use english and the dresses the decorations and all of the small details in the show its lovely that they display both white and black people perfectly blended into the society in the shows its such a great entertainment
i love the take shonda rhimes has on this historical romance series although i do wish lady whistledown hadnt been found out by anyone and that the reveal of who she is came at the end of the last seasoni am so glad that anthony finally got out of his own way and got together with katei think that this series is a good first step into this genre keeping it simple and with a generally decent story line from the books although i do think if they are thinking of doing another series like this they should look to stephanie laurenss cynster series or the bastion club series now those are story lines that have drama aplenty for anyone along with great romance and from the descriptions in the books great sex too
i dont get all the hate i absolutely loved both seasons very watchable its obviously fantasy and escapism im not sure why the low raters are taking it so seriously i love the diversity and modern takes colour palette dress designs etc
it was beautiful the story was complex and exciting the cast truly drew the viewer in and brought the story to life the scenery and costumes were elegant and brought the viewer into the world the various storylines were raw fun and full of intrigue overall it was a delight full of laughs tears and suspense
when was the story of this tv show i dont think they had the song wrecking ball by miley cyrus at that time but that was the song the orchestra performed at the last ball when kate  lord anthony dance
"the reviews for every film are usually justified except for this one all the bad reviews are because of diversity however let me remind you that it was never meant to be historically accurate
it is a great quality tv show where black people are equal to white and not portrayed as servants only finally children will be able to sympathize with the main hero instead of asking their parents why are we portrayed as slaves in nearly all movies the main message here is to imagine new dawn for humanity which some time ago were two separate societies divided by color until a king fell in love with a queen love conquers all and can change everything be kinderfor anybody who wants to watch a visually stunning tv series with great actors and a captivating story  give it a try"
"this is an amazing show just watched episode one and went right into episode two this is a unique storyline with some historical context to it abs incredibly well done the costumes are so artistic and the townships are in the most perfect settings
i am watching this until there is no more"
i read all the series of the bridgerton and it is icredible how i could see the characters in the actors i really loved everything
good production i did not read the books so i can t tell how were they adapted i don t mind the diversity issue good vibez
i hesitated after the first two episodes because it was kind of boring and i had read some mediocre reviews but in the end this series was pleasantly enjoyablehere is my analogy for those wondering if they should watch its the crown mixed with fifty shades of grey and narrated like desperate housewives super intense love scenes and despite not looking like a compatible match the main couple ended up workinghopefully there is a second season in the works theyve got the following for it
season  definitely justified the twoyear wait and for the people who like the plot to follow the book simply skip it although the book does not follow the plot  it kept the core and honestly i think these  episodes are great i know that we dont all like everything the same and that the series is not to everyones taste i dont expect the series to follow the plot of the book completely but its important to me that it doesnt change important facts and that was achieved here the clothing doesnt fully follow the fashion of the s and there is no need because this is a fictional love story only set in that period for those who loved the first two seasons i think they will love the third one even more
i quite enjoyed the first season apparently despite the inyourface political correctness of the ethnic diversity of the british aristocracythe second season however makes me regret i even watched the first one this time around even the familiar characters seem much less amicable and the acting skills of their portrayers much deteriorated every scene seems to have been completed in one take as facial expressions and gesticulations seem animated exaggeratedly and the moral of every character seem to have adopted the notion that the more self serving the sensation of love is the more deserving one is of it notions of romance and vulnerability has been cast to the side by scheming and opportunism multiple scenes each episode are dedicated to mutual enabling of toxic behaviour as well as endless recycling of similar scenarios not to mention the cringeworthy placement of acoustics of modern day pop songsbut by far the worst thing about this season is that it is blatantly obvious how it will spell out already after watching the first  minutes and then having to sit through the rest of the episodes witnessing its terrible execution and poor attempts at surprising the viewer and make us root for the obvious ending twist by making all parties involved ever less likeablein short i will certainly not be watching any potential future seasons
if you want to be entertain and if you have a sense of humor well this is the show for you i love the casting characters and the actors did a marvelous job each characters journey was well executed and a decent ending to the series in case there is not a second season it is disappointing to see all the negative reviews especially for the reasons for the negative reviews i didnt watch this show to get an accurate account of history l watched bridgerton so that i could be entertained
"the casting is the best thing i have seen in a while
i absolutely loved the books and they smashed it
as far as im concerned the best book adaptations i have ever seen"
"i watched the first season and loved it i was hoping season  would be just as good and wow it was im hooked and cant wait for many more seasons
the cast is just wonderful each character is is perfect
love love love"
i adore this show so much the casting is brilliant and although it is of course not exactly as the book the stories they added work perfectly i think cant wait for the next season
i went into this series with a blank page i didnt know what it was about or what to expect havent heard about the books only chose to watch because it was so popular on netflix and boy oh boy do i not regret it i watched it all in one swoop i normally dont like period shows but this one had me hooked im starting the books tomorrow the acting is good the sideburns awful and the plot is exciting truly hoping netflix will make more seasons 🤞🏼
season  i think i enjoyed the novelty of it all the accents the costumes and set design the gallantry the sexual tension in season  with the long dramatic pauses had me feeling nauseousdrivel im sure i could feel myself losing brain cells while watching
"jane austen its not but i dont care it is delightful trash and i didnt go into it expecting shakespeare either i remember reading these books because i could buy them from the cvs next door to my old job watching the show i realized i recognized the storyline and laughed out loud i cant believe they made a show based on regency bodice rippers and i couldnt be happier they did this show breathes life into the insipid characters from the page and does do with humor and without taking itself too seriously the casting was well done and its about time hollywood realized that poc can do regency and bring a refreshing take on old staple i loved lady danbury eloise and penelope of course the duke was smoking hot as he should be and having read julia quinns books i recognized other characters as well
the fact is if youre expecting a historically accurate period piece you wont find it here i cant imagine what people thought they were gonna get when they watched a show based on the bridgerton books but this exceeded any expectations i could have had
if you want to watch some silly fluff look no further
i love it and watched it with tongue in cheek"
i was surprised at all the bad reviews im in my s and even though it did have elements of a teen drama i really enjoyed it the cinematography the modern twist on classical music the characters the costumes and cast were excellent it felt like gossip girl meets the crown and i was entertained and wanting to watch them all at oncei think the diversity was a really important part of its success and id love to see more shows with a cast like this
a wow factor indeed a wonderful storyline of betrayal scandal love  the murder most fool this a gripping tale that you would want share with your bffs over a pot of tea  biscuits i advise the audience of this review of this post to read the book the duke  i i would love to be the duchess of hasting with the proper etiquette and all i cant wait on the upcoming books on netflix
loved it i love the books and because i have been disappointed before with adaptations of books that i really like i did not create expectations about bridgerton best thing ive ever done the adaptation is really very good in every detail and even the small changes in the narrative were very welcome and the detail i liked the most apart from the cast which is just wonderful were the songs that served as background for the balls i loved that contemporary touch
"i dont know why there are so many bad reviews on this show its so brilliantly done is funny dramatic powerful
the costumes are on point and its beautiful to watch"
i loved how the two characters portrayed by phoebe and page fell in love you could feel the romance between the two lets not forget the romantic scenes that made this movie a sure watch for me
since there are no recent notable period drama airing bridgerton is a medicine for this need it is like a jane austen kinda drama mixed with gossip girl by a contemporary author acting is amazing but the shining star of the series is definitely eloise bridgerton claudia jessie shes the flavour of the tv series i cant wait to see her romance story in the future seasons i am aware that every book is a love story of one of each bridgerton siblings the author shows us even that annoying anthony character deserves love too second season is better and more exciting than the first one actually the first season is one of the classic period drama love stories but it is sad to not be able to see the duke again and sad to hear that phoebe dynevor who plays daphne bridgerton will not reprise her role in season  but in both season you may see the marks of pride and prejudice my favorite season is definitely the second season apart from the love story of anthony and kate btw simone ashley is a perfect choice for the role i first saw her in sex education she did quite well job there but i did not know that she is such a talented actor if there was no eloise bridgerton that would be definitely a jonathan bailey  simone ashley show  my favorite scene of the second season is absolutely the final episodes final penelope and eloise scene i mean the confrontation scene this was a remarkable scene of the season even the entire show i believe eloise ran late for this enlightenment i hope the next seasons preserve this harmony and the fluency
i really enjoyed this series i thought that the settings and costumes were perfect for the settings it is its own little world with some awesome changes it is not based on our historical world and characters are not based on who they were in our real historythe acting was great and they did really well for the scripts they were given in season  especially regejean page the dukeif youre looking for a romantic drama with risqué scenes this is for youhowever i just found that it is based off a book series and read the duke and i which season  is loosely based oni know the writers couldnt focus only on  people to make a series worth watching and some of the things they changed or added did really well but they screwed up on the whole love story and how the characters are supposed to interact with one another and their feelings i was very disappointed as i feel like the writes failed completely on delivering what could have been a better outcomeread the bookshaving read all the books and queen charlotte i am confused as to why the writers of this series are screwing up the story and massively skipping parts like book  and spilling beans in series  that doesnt happen till a decade later
take all the bawdy soapy stuff from riverdale and mix it with downton abbeys historical charm and youre getting close to what bridgerton is all about it knows its a little outrageous and it has a blast being itselfthere are a lot of folks complaining about the diverse cast here and these complaints should point to exactly how cunning this show is it doesnt give a damn about history or accuracy and instead it wants to give a silly sexy and selfaware spin on a genre that is often dusty and stilted this isnt a period piece for people who long to romanticize and reenact the era this is set this is a period piece that longs to make people relish the absurdity and charm of period piecesyou can find the joy in this eccentric series if you see just how tongue in cheek it is its marie antoinette by sophia coppola reimagined for bingewatching soap loving audiences and its delightful
"what is the matter with you who have written such terrible reviews
this is creativity at its best the mad hair and embellished costume design should give you the indication that it isnt even set on this planet but an alternative universe
it honestly doesnt matter that its far fetched and surreal  it is funny and well acted so just sit back and relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery and costumes"
doesnt do justice to the books and the bad acting didnt help
i feel like people giving this bad reviews are just sort of freaked out by the casting of black and brown actors as historically caucasian figures i mean it was strange at first for me mainly because i dont expect nonwhite people to speak in that posh upperclass way and behave so rigidly as they do in these period dramas but about halfway through the second episode i found the alternative casting made the whole thing more interesting to me the nonwhite characters just grabbed my attention whenever they were on screen partially because theyre excellent actors and fun to watch and regéjean page as the duke  lordy meow and i think i also felt the sort of runofthemill plot was elevated somewhat with this added visual elementbut to criticise the acting as some did here is ludicrous the acting is superb as are the characterisations the whole thing is a bit unreal the candybright costumes especially give it a sort of fantasy feel the plot is a bit onenote and simplistic and i admit im not super enthralled with a drama focusing on whether or not certain people will get married but it was charming mostly due to the wonderful cast and buoyant directionas people of that time might say its a most pleasant diversion
i loved this series so much and as a reader of the books i can say it is amazing of course as an adaptation there were scenes that i would like to be in the series however everything is perfect that i didnt care i highly recommend this series to everyone remembering that there are hot scenes there are scenes that make you cry and despite being a period series the modernity inserted in it current songs played in a classical version everything is perfect i highly recommend the series to everyone remembering that there are hot scenes and there are also scenes that make you cry
ohhhh how i loved this season the chemistry between the  main roles was so believable and i held my breath in many parts i loved season  but this in my opinion is so much better cant wait for next season
this was a delightful escape from a bad  the story costumes actors etc were all very good as to the comments about race heres a bit of history for you queen charlotte descended from the black portuguese royal line she was black also during the regency period there were black aristocrats albeit few in number they did exist nevertheless this is a fictional account of a period in history told from todays rules where color of skin should not matter when it comes to characters in a show hamilton paved the way for this and i certainly hope it continues and we move away from typecasting in film
"a modern day twist on something which is normally bland people use your imagination as this is not your usual casting it brought colour flare diversity isnt this what we all want
the series is brilliant to the writers well done you kept me hooked roll on series "
i feel that not since  gone with the wind  has a screened entertainment had so much fuss and after seeing a few episodes i found its triviality pitiful and its rather camp content much ado about nothing yes the diversity of casting is good in itself but i believe acting quality comes first and that regejean page though good to look at gives a perfunctory performance the other lead phoebe dynevor is equal in pallid delivery and has very little charisma the plot so far relies heavily on  pride and prejudice  elements and that is tedious especially when women start flocking around page as if he is some kind of god the other actors  or some of them  are better jonathan bailey on the acting level is head and shoulders above regejean page and adjoah andah steals every scene she is in the title bridgerton is so close to sanditon for comfort and i just wish jane austen was here to pass comment as for the direction the less said the better but a  for bailey in a powerful role and some good lines and for the diversity of casting
i cannot explain my feelings properly but i shall try as you see ive adopted the attitude of the ladies of the series shameless am i so today we are gonna talk about love ok ok i know it is not so thoughtful of me but believe me the story in this series is worth knowing i will not tell it to you of course im not lady whistledown after all but i can be quite the same if only we had school newspaper sorry out of the point i only meant to say that i want to express my full gratitude towards the whole crew of this series this was a pleasant and very enjoyable experience for two days yes in fact i waited a year and a half to watch it for  days thats why i am telling you that you will not be wasting your time watching it you will adopt the feeling of being in their generation and as a part of their journey i assure you but if i could be like lady whistledown and write gossip for entertaining our pitiful world i wouldve dreams dreams arent we all allowed to have them we shall see
"season  omg
without wordsits amazing 👏 😍i didnt like season  so i gave it up  times but in the end i finished it and i was really thinking if i should watch season  thank you god for doing it"
i love this show and i am here for the diverse cast which apparently has been ruffling the feathers of a lot of viewers lets face it a lot of people have a hard time seeing a person of color cast as anything other than a slave or a servant i can see the steam coming out of their ears now pitykeep up the wonderful work shonda and friends
"lets do a food metaphor great dramas are like gastronomic dishes subtle and exquisite
but bridgerton isnt that its more like a cake it exists to trigger every pleasure receptor in your brain and it does that perfectly which is why i give it "
bridgerton surprised me i started watching expecting some tired old jane austin story but it was good well written terrific acting in all parts casting did a great job the costumes were all gorgeous and the sets were just fabulous i enjoyed this show very much would like to see more by these writers maybe another series could be made
beautiful set and costume design ive not read the books so my review doesnt carry that baggage i like the diverse casting no need to see whitey mcwhiteypants having all the fun the feminist honking is a little overthetop hard to listen to the  male or female whining so loudly worth watching but have a phone on hand to distract during the cringe moments
love love loved it it is fun the characters are great it was the perfect christmas present from netflix i think it was my best gift of the year i can say if you are watching in hopes of seeing other shows maybe this isnt for you i love jane austen movies and downtown abbey this is not a boring carbon copy of those it is its own perfect show
i cannot understand why so many people put bad reviews up about this ignoredefinitely give this a go i wasnt sure in episode  if it was for me but then i started to hooked in very well done and great cast few familiar faces from uk dramas etc like polly walker cant wait for season 
perfectly idealrecently i have finished watching of the most provoking and very bold tvshow of the beginning  bridgerton and that is my opinionit was brilliant perfectly ideal form the first minutes of the show quickly catching the attention of the audience exciting from the first shots admirable from the first sight newly lightly fresh like a breath of fresh air it seems to me that this project is what we need most now the project that is broken the stereotypes of old costume moviei cant explain to myself why the cast of the show raised the wave of protest and misunderstanding because in my view there was the great spice of the show inviting to the starring roles the black actors the actors game the next characters like the duke of hastings lady danbury marina thomson will mondrich and others did great was off the charts at the end of the show all the characters became so close friends to me that i cant highlight the most bright and memorable performancefirstly my attention was attracted be the hero of violet  the mother of the great and shockingly prolific bridgerton family because as i see the mother of such huge and friendly family should be like her in the show she is kind understanding intelligent a little bit nervous if it is about her children and she knows how to find an approach to each of her children except may be eloise nevertheless i am absolutely sure that she will make out her in further seasons and help her to find her place in a high societymy second love is regepage who performed the starring role of the duke of hastings yes he is lovely handsome he is fantastically handsome it is very hard to take eyes off the screen when he has appeared he is gentle charming with good manners long neck pleasant countenance great professional and profound actor at the beginning it was strange to me how the hero with so sad unhappy childhood abandoned by his own father could grow up and turn in such mature confident and honorable person but sometimes the miracles can happenat the show we get acquainted with different type of noble family bridgerton featherington cowper and others despite the fact that main family proclaimed the postulates of the flawless and traditional life without brothels gambling bets betrayals was bridgerton my favourite family was featheringtonmay be it has been explained that they are not so perfect interesting and ideal like bridgerton and by this reason more close to real life may be because they are more bright jolly direct obviously that beautiful fresh daphne sooner or later will be engaged to the prince duke viscount or someone noble and wonderful person but how to get married a less beautiful daughters one of which is a little bit fat and others are not very pretty especially without rich dowry this is a challenge for standout character of portia featheringtonall featherington family is bright colored brave distinguished from calm honorable and noble bridgerton that is living without defect they are ridiculous at some moments of the show but in my view they are not vulgar frankly ignorant in spite of their greenyellowpink clothes and not very noble actionsit is much sorrowful watching the unrequited penelopes love to colin bridgerton and her sufferings about him he has been looking at her only at a friend but maybe the storyline get continued on other seasonthe character of portia featherington is significant for the story because she is a real head of this family and there are many goals raising in front of her how to marry daughters that is not very beautiful or wellmannered and at the end of the narration they staying without any dowry and money how to rid of the shame relating with marina thomson how to help her unfortunate husband paying off a debt to the creditors all od these matters has fallen on the shoulders of the womanwhat can i say as a resume i will be waiting for new seasons that as netflix promised will be  not the less
if you like reading romantic fairytales with happy endings then watch thisif you prefer historical accuracy with logical reasoning then this is not for you
wondering how the overall rating is  it must be  at most there is fastfood and it seems now there is fastseries the same crap tasteless just colors i wonder how one can compare this piece of  with downton abbey
it is gossip girl in a parallel universe i like it it is for those of us who like romance and prince charming stories the first season was so juicey as it had the perfect lead actor  such handsome man i recommend it to be watched by romance lovers 
i am absolutely enthralled by this period drama that makes me feel as if we could have had a beautiful world in which color was as natural as being a human
its perfect i really cant understand why some people are so angry for black actors theyre playing white characters when the contrary happens dont have all this commotion i think theres a word for that right
this came up in my recommended for you list a couple of times but did not capture my attention i love period dramas and so yesterday i decided to embark on the series captured my attention immediately and held it through the entire series the storytelling is enjoyable and none of the stories are too laboured but there is sufficient character development to have you invested a definite  out of 
bridgerton was really a welcome surprise this christmas it is much more than you can expect watch and be amazed by the most fertile family in high society
i really wanted to like this and it is indeed visually stunning but for me it failed in so many ways i didnt mind historical inaccuracies what period drama doesnt have its fair share but i disliked the oh so predictable story lines the what comes across as an attempt to be jane austenish on the one hand and then incorporate st century attitudes on the other not really sure what it was trying to be my favourite character was the queen loved her which is why i give it  stars
binged watched in  days  i really hope season  comes out soon
a lovely indulgence show enjoyed every moment every single one of the actors was so attractive i literally could not tear my eyes away from the screen
i found myself enjoying season  much more than season  there was more humour relatable and i didnt think i would like anthony as much as i did but him and kate with that slow burn  yes kate is good as well eloise storyline was also really good and i loved the evolvement of her hope to see more anthony and kate and more of the bridgeton family i didnt miss phoebe or reges characters tbh i thought i would
a fairytelling bright and beautiful piece of work i look forward to the next season
it was so entertaining and fun to watch with all bright dresses and with a totally different area and diversity just loved it it also has a very good and cute story
honestly if you really enjoyed the books dont watch this this was made for the twitter bio lovers
so much fun sexy scandalous and so much fun to watch most haters are upset with the diversity so ignore those reviews i was initially disappointed with season two because there was a lot less sexy scenes but the tension is what makes it so sexy and so fun a really enjoyable watch
baffling that no one bothers to look up any actual history when claiming a drama and romance that never claimed to be historically accurate wasnt just that queen charlotte likely was born of african and portuguese descent if anyone cares to find it clearly from her portraits she wasnt white so its not so farfetched there could be other royals descended from other moors and the like even if not slavery wasnt that visible in the uk not like america they werent picking cotton in england they used slaves in their other colonies where they had money in sugar cane and spices etc but if youre that bent out of shape over the mixed race casting or that its not like the books or that they mix in string quartet versions of pop songs its called creative license stop whining or having purist ideas of what this should be the rest of us are enjoying a bit of escapism  yes what is essentially gossip girl in an austen novel  during quarantine and this garbage year if thats not your thing no one is stopping you from watching something else
i really loved this series it was like watching a romance novel on screen and the guy that plays the duke he is scorching the writing was phenomenal and the acting on point
i watched this in a matter of hours i absolutely loved it and the books
if you are smart enough to know this is fiction and accept diversity you might enjoy this
this is ridiculous the acting is barely okay its superficial the mix of ages doesnt work for me maroon  or billie ellish have nothing to do in a ballroom in the th century some rules have to be respected to be true to period dramas i had great expectations but
"bridgerton was an delicious dreamy christmas treat it was such a fun and totally sexy show to watch the costumes sets music and acting were delightful escapism fitting for the last week of a challenging yeari was not a long time fan of the book series but read them once i saw the preview for this show i started reading romance for distraction and comfort during the pandemic and was excited to see a romance novel used as a source material for tv just like all romance novels the plots of the bridgerton book series and first season of the show are predictable and formulaic but comforting at the same time you know theres going to be problems but things will come together in the end dont come looking to find a shocking unexpected plot that being said you will find characters with depth and beautiful stories about love vulnerability and family i was happy with the adaptation of the characters and the changes they made to the plotim disappointed with the negative reviews regarding the diverse casting i understand the need to be aware of not erasing history but thats not whats going on here bridgerton is a fantastical st century romance story set in the th century its refreshing to have black actors cast in a period piece its refreshing the see regejean page play a duke in a romantic lead i never got the feeling that bridgerton was trying to do anything but provide a romance with representation all the haters need to get over it and really look into their hearts at why a black duke in a fictional story bothers them so muchwinners
anthony jonathan bailey was the best actor of the ensemble in my opinion fans of the books might be disappointed in how anthony struggles in the show but i think they gave anthonys character so much room to grow
eloise she was a joy and even more fun than in the books she provided as space for feminist critique of the restrictions of their society
the actors had amazing chemistry and it showedcriticisms
dont be mad i loved it and can still have critiques
the diversity was amazing but i did notice that almost all of the black actresses were lightskinned and there were very few darkskinned actresses with speaking lines if youre going to have a diverse cast it might be a good idea to be a bit more conscious of that
it didnt go unnoticed that they chose to cast a black woman for the role of marina one of the only tragic storylines from the series and they expanded it with an secret pregnancy if you know the books you know her story is not a happy one just a bit disappointing to add a black character that doesnt get to have a happy ending like everyone elseconsent i was wondering if they were going to change the daphnesimon conflict in the show but it was even more glossed over and downplayed i felt like they could have done a better job at addressing consent and trust in simon and daphnes relationshipoverall i loved it even with its flaws you should watch it if you are looking for a pretty romantic drama"
"the perfect mix of glamour intrigues beautiful decors dresses gossip romance sex and love in a patriarch society where the woman are the strongest
these days people are not used to see acts of love and sexuality therefore many give a low rating is for many people more difficult to see compared to acts of violence but rest assured the sex is passionate but not explicit and suitable for all ages
its a typical historical romance novel adapted to the screen and its perfectly done the performances are strong i would love to see more"
i dont know what everyone is complaining about as a black woman i enjoy the diversity of the show people really show their true colors when shows like this are made quit your belly aching and deal with it kudos to ms shonda rhimes i cannot wait for season 
my godi adore everything about thisliterally everything and ive only seen  episodes buti know because its shondathat this will not only never disappoint but ill be desperate for more
"to evaluate a highly produced series with  stars just because there are black characters is racism
where is your sense black people exist and deserve to be portrayed equally to whites in cinematographic works there is no use ignoring
and about the excuse of the time for the love of god is a fictic series there is no reason for this to be a requirement for only white people in the cast"

"brilliant could not stop watching the episodesbingeworthy cannot wait for a second series stunning costumes great fun plotline well acted by all
absolutely love this"
ive seen numerous book adaptations over the years and none have been so well done as bridgerton it follows julia quinns books so closely while also adding some changes that seamlessly fit with the story the cast is impeccable and the flow of events is perfect not a moment of boredom i look forward to many more seasons as we get to see the stories of each of the siblings
the second season was so much better than the first one much more detail into the characters still i wish they would make more eps per season the finale felt a little bit rushed but i love it
i usually dont like the adaptations of books this one though is an exeption i loved that the first season set up information for the other characters evwn more that the first book did specially loved the georgemarinaphilip subplot
"fantastical soap opera period piece
the diverse cast is utterly swoonworthy i also appreciate all the new faces  none bring prior characters theyre known for to this story
im keeping fingerscrossed that theres more seasons to come apparently the book series are  in total  one for each bridgeton sibling
aside from the main characters i really enjoyed eloise played by claudia jessie"
i really liked the first season the atmosphere was an intensified english historical drama with all the right ingredients clever banter love drama high stakes character building and an intriguing narrator who was an integral part of the plot i looked forward to season  but thensecond season yeesh what a difference the bridgerton format seems to be the start of each years series of balls and soirees designed to match eligible gentlemen and ladies i suspect that each season will focus on a member of the bridgerton family season one was about the oldest girl daphne and season two was about anthony the oldest son and viscount fine some of the good from the first season was still there the clever family banter and eloise the middle bridgerton sister whose personality was delightfully quirky for the most part but the rest was dreckthe main love interests were so illogical dense and obstinate  especially kat  it made them impossible to relate to and it was slow  painful irrational and endless with repetitive and often contradictory conversations on responsibility and finding ones true self  slow when the inevitable happened i didnt care anymorethis snoozefest was determined to last eight hours regardless to fill it out somewhat they had a pointless sideline with eloise and a printer boy a silly side order of fraud with the featherington family and a dose of feminism if season two did anything it made all the main characters from season one less likeable i wont be watching season three
although the st season was very good i much prefer the nd less gratuitous sex scenes i found it a little over done in the first season enjoying the story in the nd season
im a huge history buff as well as a lover of all things english the first episode caught me off guard and i wasnt sure if i could wrap my head around the concept im not familiar with the books and casting but as the series went on i actually fell in love with the pure fantasyuniqueness of it the chemistry and smoldering attraction between daphne and simon was almost as good as claire and jamie if you know you know anyway is it historically factual absolutely not but sometimes its good to let go and enjoy a fun period piece with no expectations
i dont think bridgerton is supposed to be taken seriously it is however beautifully entertaining especially for the gorgeous costumes dancing music lovely lead stars and the romance there is so much to enjoy that it fully makes up for any slight flawsexcess super
i loved the series the representation was fantastic and very important to construct a better world
i enjoyed watching it its fun and entertaining its not really history so dont watch it if you expect it to be that
what has the world come to this is beyond cringe bad acting bad writing and boring nothing but a cheesy interracial fest in regency clothesi dont want to waste any more time reviewing this crap show but its telling me i need  characters
the best things about this movie is the sets the outfits and scenes of the period drama beautiful acting by all the characters and awesome chemistry between the lead actors the queens gowns deserve a special mention an excellent story line to keep us engrossed all through the series am eagerly waiting for season 
i absolutely adore it and so does every one i know that has watched it more
i cant wait for more im obsesses i know it is probably not for all people who read the book just give it a try it wont hurt
"bridgerton is a delight
i hope they make many more seasons the sets and costumes are amazing the actors are great i love shonda rhimes production of julia quinns book"
i was so excited to the series and i really loved the outcome i just cant be more happy the actors was a perfect i just cant describe in word my happiness
this series is as inaccurate as it can be an not corresponding with reality whatsoever closer to a fairytale than to a historical drama especially the fact that this series is politically correct in ways this time period was absolutely not this makes the series odd
the cast is perfect we can see representativeness and diversity and this is amazingcolorful bridgerton
i mean season two is even better i know there is no duke but the romance between the two main leads is sizzling it is intense and i cant stop thinking about iteverything else works too it is funny there is drama and the music still does ityes i gave it a  still riding the wave of excitement
"amazing this serie is the best
i like this
i like history
i love everything and i agree a second seasson for yesterday pls"
the show brought julia quinns characters to life each and every person is tailor made for their roles i dont think i can wait an year for season  so netflixchrisvandusan shondaland please hurry
"the serie is not like the book but i attempted to say its even better
the adaptation is there with some differences from the book but all the vibe romance drama and even funny parts are all over the place in so many beautiful ways to explore it
as a fan of the books i felt excitement sadness joyful and the most important in a romantic piece of art i fell in love with everything the music is spectacular the cast choice is just perfectloved it so much
cant wait for the next season to watch antonys story on screen"
ery disappointed bad acting and the actors are totally devoid of presence and charm therefore there is no chemistry there is no passion there is no beauty everything very badly done it seems that i am watching an open tv show for teenagers ridiculous
its funny entertaining and sexxxxyyyy loved it so much i watched it  times already and its only been out like two weeks this is a must watch show for all the people saying they only watched  minutes and had to stop shame on you
i really enjoyed this series i didnt read the books so i didnt really care that it doesnt follow them exactly oh and i have an open mind so i didnt really care that there was a black queen in that time period geez people
season  now looking at it was mid compared to season  was done so well so perfect everything felt so right  cant wait for season  and on hopefully gets better as it did from season  to 
totally binge worthy i loved the diversity and the excellent actors they chose watched the whole season in  day and really hoping for more soon
it is simple if you wanna escape the harsh world we in it even if it is as temporary and short as  hours it will do the job and do it perfectly
i couldnt even watch the first episode ive read the whole series of novels and loved them this show is nothing like the novels and im embarrassed for the author of said novels i guess money trumped her hard workthe acting is just so bad and it is all wrong when it comes to the regency period the manners the gaudy dressjust no
this was just beautiful from the costumes to the sets to the cast to the script it was just one of those series you know the ones im talking about when youve watched the last of the episodes and youre sad that its over i wasnt concerned with who was in what role why they shouldnt be in that role nor any historical accuracy issues i just loved it for being the story it was beautifulas a side note i just want to know what happened to the diamond necklace that the prince had given to daphne she took it off when she was on the bridge and that is the last we heard or saw of it we were distracted when simon followed her into the garden right after but what happened to the necklace o
i found the perfect series the chemistry of the main couple is incredible 
i loved this watched it all on boxing day the characters are all really well done the acting can be bit over the top but i think thats the point i dont know what all of the bad reviews are about because i thought it was great
very engaging storyline and characters the clothing is gorgeous
season  deserves  very soapy season   only  at last we have tv show that it is a show  lovely entertaining fantastic and spectacular in first season script writers did a very good job and the main cast is just perfect
 stars for some good acting like for example anthony and penelope but omg what a waste of time season  was it should have been at least  episodes shorter the main story was so cringei think season  was bad also because kate was completely miscast simon hastings was also portrayed by a black actor but he was behaving like an english aristocrat and he showed feelings this is the problem of season  both edwina and especially kate were behaving like foreigners and i could not believe why anthony who was looking for a woman like him fell in love kate sharma  an idian woman behaving like one it was really dearing to cast  black women to play  aristocratic english women in the th century but to make them behave like foreigners was too much for methe romance between the indian kate and the englishman anthony did not convince me at all they had no chemistry probably because she had a stoned face and a fake smile most of the time why on earth did they choose this actress and why are people saying she did a great jobso i felt that the whole season  was like a satire because of the historical inaccuracy its like making a movie about nelson mandela and casting a white actor to play the main character that how off the casting for kate and edwina felt to mealso eloise was extremly annoying and she was behaving like a young bored chic from our time the only character i was really interested in was penelope
it has drama romance and a great plotline definitely a must watch totally recommend
im really in much more love with the series is very inclusive to all the races and the chances were better for the tv formats hopefully well have asians on the royalty soon too
i feel like im the same and even better than books im in love with the characters
amazing just amazing this serie needs continuation
its a good show with good acting believable chemistry between daphne and simon funny and enjoyableand the costumeswhat i dont like its rewriting history for politically correct purposes
nothing destroys a period piece worse than production not having done its due diligence and research dont think i made it through the first episode as the clothingcostumes were sloppy off era and cheap did i see a pair of spiked heals when a hem kicked up the jewelry was s junk costume as a civil war reenactor and costume reproducer from the s  s and collector of most i have zero tolerance for millennials feeble attempts at costuming theres no absolutely no excuse read a book geez like i havent made my point and im required to embellish on a series that is still available on streaming that shouldnt have made it past the cutting room floor your definitely gluttons for punishment i guess so if you want me to give examples to follow downton abby and sisiaustrian empress are good places to start other than to the best if my knowledge they hadnt designed gowns with crumb catchers in the early s but ill let them look that one up the story line cant pull this one out either
"funny mind relaxing filled with emotions bright colors nice soundtrack
i would recommend this show to anybody looking for something to relax and enjoy a weekend off
me and my husband watched it together and both enjoyed it very much and he is definitely not a type for this genre of the show
loved the characters music costumes
show is all fictions and has noting to do with history facts but very entrtaining"
im too thrilled by the show to make criticisms i loved the casting loved the sets and costumes loved that they kept to the essence and spirit of the books loved that each episode felt long enough loved pen and eloise love love lovethe only thing i would have liked to see more was more lol wit that julia quinn is so good ati want more seasons i want all the seasons
i have not read the books nor need to  i binged watched the series and couldnt turn it off loved the characters loved the costumes and enjoyed the story it was an entertaining period piece and i loved it
loved the book series and very pleased with the show
if you havent read the books you simply must julia quinn is a genius at making romance novels not just romantic but hilarious charming and addicting the series is wonderful too although there are certain liberties taken as there always are when taking a book to the screen its binge worthy for sure
omg this is the worst thing that ever happened to historical drama all these inaccuracies both historic and from the book it is so bad i dont understand what kind of statement are they trying to make lets also do a remake of mulan with white people to add diversity it is getting even more annoying season by season can someone please do this show right following the books which by the way are more historically acurate and save all this dramahorrible horrible and for feather headed people lets all swallow american productions i would have love to see that made by the english effort would have been so much better
loved it beautiful costumes and houses great acting would definitely recommend
the series is amazing and the characters are wonderful im in love with the duke
"i thought this show was a lot of fun i wasnt expecting reality or biographical accuracy at all so i appreciated the whimisical costumes and hair the archaic dialogue was executed well by the wonderful cast just as hamilton was not racially accurate bridgerton follows in its brilliant footsteps to push the boundaries of diversity and include all people of all colors to fill a variety of roles in this entertaining series
it was also surprisingly refreshing to watch something set in such a different time this is an innocent and oldfashioned exploration of romance and sex ie not for the prudes otherwise give it a go"
this show is awesome the cast diversity and the overacting is an absolute delight it reminds me of soap operas in late ss love it watch and enjoy
couldnt stop watching loved the romans and story and it the story has some twists and turns i wasnt expecting soooo good
season one was great the story in season two was great but the actors just couldnt deliver it it seems to be lacking some of the excess drama or sun plots of season  and the actress who played kate felt absolutely lifeless and one dimensional always sad when this happens to a promising series
i was quite ill when this show came out  only heard about it during the nd week of january  so there i was lying in bed watching tv and i got so swept away it really took my mind of my troubles the casting was brilliant  i wasnt expecting it to be so diverse and i didnt watch it for the diversity but it made the show that much more enjoyable cant wait for season 
this was such a delight stellar acting and casting the soundtrack the story everything netflix and shondaland are a match that cant be beat i will be anxiously awaiting a second season
starting the series i was not expecting much from the first episode i got this feeling of watching choices live action it was very bland but as the episodes were going it got very addictive the characters gained a lot more depth and relatability if you want to see a romance  funny at times series then this is for you it isnt anything groundbreaking and dont expect youll see the world differently after watching it but it is surely an enjoyable series to get you through quarantine
from the reviews its clear either youll love it or youll hate itits not period drama not historical documentary as many critics here tries to imply and evaluates accordinglyits romantic drama with very good budget i love season  even more because of the great chemistry main actors sharei read the books and im not bothered that plot was changed new approach made more sense than some scenes in the booksi guess this show is more for people that experienced love and knows the feeling
highly recommend watching ive binged watch season one and cannot wait for more
the story had great possibilities ive watched several seasons of greys anatomy and therefore have an idea of what shonda rhimes seems to enjoy putting in her shows because of this and the fact that netflix doesnt seem to be controlled the way television networks are so shonda rhimes could put in all of her disgusting ideas into this show i wasnt planning on watching it i finally decided to give it a shot because i love regency romance like many i didnt approve of changing the races of people who were real people in history who actually lived and had their own personalities and who are not how theyre being pictured here not just a change of color but from what ive read of queen charlotte a change of personality normally i dont have an issue with creating a diverse cast but as with many of shonda rhimes work she seems to be obsessed solely by the black and white races also her idea of a diverse cast was to just throw in a few black people here and there and call it a day im still wondering how black queen charlotte has a white blond haired blue eyed nephew unless hes really the kings nephew but if i remember my research correctly he is the queens nephew i was also disgusted with the filth in this show showing actual sex scenes and describing other things that have no real place in a tv show is horrible but as ive said shonda rhimes appears to be obsessed with throwing in some black people here and there throwing in a ton of sex and masturbation as well as dissolute parties such as the one that the artists enjoy i really should have expected all this greys anatomy has plenty of this stuff but it is at least controlled some by tv regulations i shouldnt have been surprised that that woman would throw in the complete dissolution of morals and integrity that she has otherwise some of the characters are okay but i do agree that many have no real character honestly the only two who truly have character are lady featherington and penelope featherington lady featherington is not always pleasant but she is determined penelope is a kind person whom you can truly feel bad for when her heart is breaking over colin bridgerton
i cant get enough i really hope they make the entire series i love everything about it
this didnt start out as something i thought id like but it proved to be a nice escape it was wellacted a fun and tantalizing story line the period love story was engaging and fun to watch i love the period costumes and the ostentatiousness more should believe in love
in my opinion the best series ever created the representativeness that the series brought is incredible im in love and looking forward to the second season
"amazing show the performances from everyone were exceptional the chemistry between simon and daphne is beautiful
can not wait for season "
remember when we used to like watching soap operas and sweeping romantic mini series thank you bridgerton for bringing back the addictive romance and fun people whining about diversity and historical accuracy are completely missing the point the show doesnt claim to be something its not shondaland knoes exactly what its doing and they are filling a huge hole that hasnt been filled for decades sometimes we just want to be entertainedim a huge fan on the bridgerton series for years ive wanted a film adaptation but a series is even better the books are obviously better but theyve done a great job of capturing julia quinns wit charm and romance its not a perfect show but its perfect if youre looking for some feelgood escapism daphne and simons love story isnt the best of the series so its only going to get better from here cant wait for the other siblings to get their stories
i got through the whole series in about  hours absolutely boring most of the story takes place at dances the acting is atrocious by people who obviously did study how people reacted and were in those days even what sex was in it was pathetic in the first episode its like look at my stunning body and my muscles another flop from netflix
no idea why this is upsetting people at first i thought it was great casting just using actors regardless of their heritage then i realised they made a subtle change to the plot and i think its a great one it never claims to be historically accurate  its based on a romance novel people i cant wait for the next series
i think season  is much better than season  its very elaborate in presentation and thoroughly entertaining good storyline with good standard of acting nice to see continuity of characters too
so in my opinion and yes everyone is entitled to their own but i rather enjoyed the series and could not stop watching if you do not agree thats fine but do not come after me for enjoying this series
i have re watched season  and season  twice now on netflix although i do miss simon i cant wait for a season  the time frame the drama i am sucked into it all will the queen indeed try to match edwina with another suitor will there be reconciles there is so much more i want to see
i love this show i find it extremely entertaining and despite its flaws i cant help but give it a  because of season  i liked season  except for the terrible main romance it had major problems lack of chemistry between the main leads and you had the female lead rape the male lead and they made it seem like she was in the right that was awful not to mention cringy sex montages that just made the male lead look like he had no stamina lol and because they had no chemistry everything seemed extra awkward not to mention regejean pages lack of acting ability the man cant act i understand that he is attractive but he needs some serious acting lessons we had some emotional scenes and he looked like he wanted to burst into laughter atrocious actor luckily they learned their lesson in season  and the couple actually had chemistry and they didnt add anything like what happened in season  i cant wait to watch season  and hopefully we get more seasons of the rest of the couples that are left
drivel opening scenes looked promising lavish expensive and colourful rapidly descended into garbageits like whoever produced it netflix was so excited about learning the cute way people spoke in s london society that any old script would sufficeavoid
honestly right off the bat they should have put this as a fantasy fiction and not historical since it really wasnt accurate of the times it is a good show and the characters are good i binge watched this show in one day i had to know what happened next eloise was probably my favorite character because she didnt want to follow what her family wanted her to do and be i didnt even know this was a book series i plan on reading the books and then forming another opinion since i cant compare them right now i would definitely watch this and just enjoy it for what it is and not for historical purposes
it was so rewarding to watch this show with this spectacularly amazing and charming cast rege jean as simon was amazing it looked like he was born specifically for this role it was extremely satisfying to see him not to mention nicolas perfect performance with penélope it was lovely
i created this imdb profile to review this series lots of folk chatting about it being too woke got me going to be honest it has a million historical flaws it inaccurately portrays the period so badly that one almost can imagine a vauxhall corsa coming round the royal crescent to pick up the characters it is still an amazing watch which i thoroughly enjoyed for those that go on about the actors being the wrong shade of pink please get over yourselves and watch it for what it is beautiful perfect escapism loved the black queen she was fierce and majestic the english roses were very good at swooning the leading man dashing there was amazingly camp slapping and prancing what more does one need during lockdownplease watch this for what it is not what it should be if you need historical accuracy watch a documentary instead if you enjoy a slightly camp romp with lots of costume and intrigue then pour yourself a gin and enjoy it
regal outfits scandalous gossip delightful love stories fierce sexual tension passionate sex scenes intense anticipation lighthearted comedythe only reason i didnt give it  stars is because regéjean page simon basset duke of hastings isnt in season  not even as a supporting or invited actor every once in a while 😭😭😭
okay ladies and gents bridgerton is not only binge worthy but bears being watched at least  times i confess  ive watched it at least  times already there is so much depth to so many of the characters in bridgerton that each time you will see something new that you did not notice before from the multilayered personality of eloise who is ambitious enough to want to go to university  in a time when women were only allowed to study personal deportment the history of british war heroes the various lines of the monarchy societal etiquette homemaker skills of sewing  needlework playing pianoforte and hierarchical deportment as part of their education to the two lead men anthony bridgerton who is in love with someone so so so below his station in life that he is not allowed to marry who is burdened by the responsibilities placed upon him by societal ruleslaws as the eldest  yr old male of the siblings in the bridgerton family and also is obviously still traumatised  grieving the lossdeath of his beloved father since age  to  year old simon arthur henry fitzranulph basset the duke of hastings who hates his late father for the emotional and possibly physical abuse and rejectionabandonment inflicted by the man upon him due to his stammerstutter and lack of perfection from birth simon is obviously at age  still longing for his mother who died in childbirth with him beginning of episode  and is so traumatized by this that in making a vow to his father on the latters death bed that he would never sire a child it is obvious that he is at the same time absolutely  terribly afraid that any wife of his could also die in childbirth as his own mother had done and also afraid that any future child of his may be born afflicted with the same speech impediment as his all of this is in addition to him wanting to end the hastings line with himself let us not overlook how strong all of the bridgerton young ladies are  even those wanting to get married are assertive outspoken ambitious and takecharge any modern man would find that admirable and counter to his year  male colleagues attitudes including daphnes own eldest brother anthony the duke of hastings is very impressed by daphnes ability to defend herself against the loathsome toad lord berbrook her assertiveness and sense of humour as well as him being considerate  respectful enough on their wedding night to reserve  rooms at the inn so as to allow her her liberty as well as to ask do you want me to stop twice no spousal rape here i love the way simons psychological issues are slowly revealed by his godmother lady danbury his very perceptive boxing friend will mondrich who told him youre angry but not at me so  take it somewhere else and finally do something about it as well as by wills wife alice  then gradually discovered by an inexperienced but persistently perceptive  loving wife daphne episode by episode with the culmination in her plain spoken but passionate  loving speech and profession of unconditional love for him in the rain at the end episode   all resulting in his surrender to that love itself as lady danbury told him  love conquers allthis was an extremely unique modern and welcome update to romance in an otherwise stifling and archaic patriarchal time when women were bartered like little more than the butchers meat and men were not allowed to show nor verbally express the softer side of their vulnerability or emotions very well done indeed chris van dusen shondaland and netflix ignore the racist haters and keep up the excellent work of healing the dividemasterful nuanced acting on the part of regéjean page as simon using subtleties of facial expression body language and linguistic tones to convey the struggles of the brokeness and eventual healing through unconditional love from his wife of the character of simon the world today needs more of this type of love so we can have peace absolutely wonderful growth and new maturity in the acting of phoebe dynevor as daphne bridgerton compared to her previous partsroles played this role really allowed her to bring her a game as well as showcase her wider range of acting ability than previous ones it really highlights the importance of actresses choosingaccepting parts which would advance their careers for the long term rather than just for a paycheck
season  was soo good i looked forward to season  but the story line was soooo bad and the main character miss sharma was such a bad actress it was awkward and painful to watchthey hardly showed daphny and her husband wasnt in it and never spoken offit was like watching a complete different series the hair styles also were so bad in this season
things i liked costumes sets mama bridgerton eloise the duke is hot marina change up and seeing sir philip early musicthings i didnt like papa feathertons arc and the queens arcboth didnt add much to the story and revealing the identity of whistledown too earlyit should of been cut considering the series was renewed before it even premieredsomething interesting you see the bee throughout the series but no mention of its significance
"amei a adaptação e como é inclusiva
os irmãos da daphne são super carismáticos e o casal daphmon possuem uma ótima química"
"i thoroughly enjoyed this but was so disappointed to see kate listed as lady kate bridgerton when looking at the cast list after only watching  episodes of series 
where is your spoiler alert they arent even married yet but it ruined my enjoyment
the tension of whether the wedding would go ahead was ruined
when kate fell off the horse would she live or die  oh wait she will be lady bridgerton so must be ok
thanks imdb "
fluffy pretty captivating well written and well acted people who fuss about historical inaccuracies obviously either havent read the books or havent read history quinn takes as much liberty with history as shonda takes with quinns source material both are fun and entertaining if you want historical accuracy read hilary mantel also a great readshow but much much more grim as is history
i had many doubts when starting this series including my distaste for period pieces however i was quickly caught up in the sheer fun of it all i binged all  episodes in a couple of days and really enjoyed the intensity of the love affair it may be smut but its a fun ride everyone is watching this for good reason
"it is a silly show with ridiculous plots and writing the main characters look like a  some year old having sex with middle school wendy from peter pan
dumb boring and not sexy"
i dont understand why people are mad that this show have diversity when its is period drama that is base off of a regency romance fiction book the keyword is fiction which mean that it can be whatever you want it to be there are tons of period drama that stars nothing but white people so me being a person of color and seeing one that have people like me in a staring role is a awesome feeling i hope that the show creator chris van dusen keep up the good work by adding more diversity into this genre not just only in the background characters but also with the main characters ie anthony love interest kate and benedict love interest sophie and other major characters that are introduce in later books the cast of the show were amazing and everyone desever their applause definitely love the chemistry between the main two leads and as someone who read the books they are just how i imagine daphne and simon the sets were beautiful and actually made me wish i could visit a place like that for real there were moments that things just felt predictable but than again that is all apart of the genre my only advice would be never go full wattpad this season went full wattpad if you read wattpad you know what i mean
"if you enjoy period pieces like downton poldark and the tudors here is a new treat for you the costumes are incredible the mix of modern in the music and cast is refreshing i dont really understand all the haters leaving comments i see different women all day for my job and discuss shows and everyone absolutely has loved it took a few episodes for it to get steamy  but its called character building 
if you dont like period pieces dont watch it since its obviously a period piece"
 the fashion accessories  the utterly amazing wigs on the queen the hats and feathers and jewelry and hairstyles all emmy worthy the fashions  especially those for polly walker gorgeous jeweltoned brocades accessorized with the wonderful feathers and jewels the music  early baroque music translations of pop songs  brilliant and fun the stars  shoutout to claudia jessie especially  a delight to watch her act with her physical comedy stylings
"i am not going to start by saying how i dont understand all the low ratings but rather by telling you why i enjoyed the showi had never heard of the books nor read any of them before watching the show so i was rather unbiased
however i am a huge fan of period dramas and historical accuracy
but bridgeton to me even though i love all those things usually was perfect
it didnt try to get me on board with it being a historical piece but rather charmed with what it obviously had to offer phenomenal chemistry between actors great costumes fantastical garden parties amazing set design and great music
to be honest i had to watch bridgeton a second time to realize that all that classical music wasnt actually that classical but rather reimagined modern pieces ranging from ariana grande to billie eilishto be frank i loved it i watched all  episodes in one sitting and the diversity casting was a great choice and not only because they actually touch on the whole poc in  society in the show
bridgeton doesnt claim to be historically accurate but rather takes certain aspects of historical accuracy womens standing in society gossip papers in the s usw and runs with themand because i am someone that needs to know how a story continues i read the first  bridgeton books right after finishing the show
after reading i still love the show and think it was a great adaptationi can only criticize one thing the sibling banter needs to be ramped up by like  they have amazing dialogue in the books that is dearly missed in the show
other than that great show one of the better adaptation of a book series i have seen as of right now"
yes it will not win a golden globe or something like that but its a really great show if you are not a snob or entitled you will enjoy it
 i know i do the novels sparkled and were a delight so funto be fair the tv series does have great costuming and sets but thats pretty much it in fact the producers seem to make that their biggest focus instead or character development the casting is just wrong the story isnt fun at all and the gratuitous sex is just  well gratuitous
"i cannot believe some of the reviews i read 😱
especially the ones who says that its not equally with the book so what
i just loved the whole show  the dresses  the houses  everything is over the top and i loved it all i really hope the second part is coming very soon"
i dont know why everyone rated this show so low i love this show and cannot wait for the next seasons to come out i cannot wait to see all the kids and how they fall in love even if it doesnt follow the books or isnt historically accurate its still a pretty awesome show
i never thought i would ger immersed in this series i havent watched romantic movies or shows since sometime as they have just bored me mostly the lack of chemistry between the actorshowever this old fashioned romance actually got me interested the drama the costumes and the settings in fact season  was much more mushy and indulging than season  loved the chemistry and love story of anthony snd kate anthony i woukd say was one of my favourite characters the whole season him with kate was a very unlikely pairing that made it all the more fun to watch also loved the on screen banter and rapport among the bridgerton siblings i was disappointed that there were only  seasons cant wait for season  to begin
this is one nice guilty pleasure when it was released i was quite snobbish about it and didnt watch it i am glad i changed my mind as i really enjoyed it lets skip the plot and just focus on what a pleasure is for the eye the gardens the tea parties oh my the outfits the saucy sex scenes mostly season  though and that wonderful ton spoken english dont expect anything to challenge your brain or any historical accuracy just go with it and enjoy like you would enjoy a buttercream cake
i really dont understand all the horrible reviews this show is for entertaining not history i am a history buff and also huge austen and bronte fan so this isnt that but it is entertaining beautiful dresses scenery and people i was stuck inside for a year working from home and this show was a perfect distraction from life for a while a fantasy type of getaway dont read the reviews try it and you might like or you might hate it i loved it so do all my friends and family
"every actoractress overacts every scene and it is frankly frustrating perhaps frustrating is not the right word perhaps the right word is rageinducing the story is as predictable as the the sun rising in the morning and with the terrible acting it adds up to a nauseating concoction that should have just been left on the shelf at netflix
if possible i would have given this  stars"
a must watch series at first i thought it would be not that great but its awesome 
i thought this was pretty good initially i kept passing it up as i searched for something to watch someone told me to check it out and i was glued for three days i thought it was funny sure you wouldnt see a lot of this back in those days but have we forgotten to have an imagination use some noodle and expand your horizons a little now it helps when you have a genevieve delacroix omg she is so sexy every time i look at her and hear her speak i melt in the couch please do not kill her off i will stop watching
i liked a series as a novel something unreal and it took it to another level but i really didnt like the story of antony and kate at all an unforgivable betrayal to her sister and they stay together i didnt like it at all and penelopes story finally gets her noticed more and it turns out she gets hated for being the gossip paper writer no i didnt like it at all
i loved the first season so much the second was just fine i expected a lot more after how the first one waswhat i do like about the whole series the era even if its not completely accurate to me was very beautifully done i love all the customes i also love the fun detail of having modern songs turned into an era appropiate soundthe whole lady whistledown mistery in the first season was so fun to watch for me i also loved the whole fake dating to real in the main characters the first season i was rooting for it to happenabout the second season i loved the new main ladies so just for that my rating stays
i never read the books but i am loving this series the diversity is fantastic and refreshing
i can say last years season had chemistry and a story this year between anthony and kate zero it doesnt matter what race you throw in but if youre trying too hard to mix them and it shows the chemistry is doomed i mean the constant arguing and cold shoulder treatment until the last episode was annoying at best and then throw some passion in didnt seem intimate i had to constantly fast forward because it wasnt real awkwardly a mess of a second season
escapism at its finest gorgeous costumes stunning sets beautiful people theres a ton of build up and heat and humor and passion everything i want in the romance genreits a tv series based on a romance novel not a historical documentary it doesnt matter if its not  historically accurate thats not the pointthe point is love and bridgerton delivers
"with zero expectations i stumbled upon bridgeton to fill a gap in my holidays and was delighted the chemistry between the two leads was exceptional and grew on me like a warm yearning blanket the actress playing daphne is diverse in her ability to be strong empathetic and vulnerable
i enjoyed this so much and the extraordinary costumes and sets were beautiful the modern take of music from billy eilish etc played in old ways was fun and the diversity of cast refreshing and magical to consider a world without an eye on race this was a completly gorgeous wonderfully entertaining piece"
i loved it so much the characters are so amazing and talent the story is very good and the appearance looks stunning one of the most good series of the year and i can not wait for the next
missed some of the scenes from the books but overall  would and will watch over and over and over again
slow and boring no reason to follow watching it very boring
i dont normally want to watch things like this i will admit to that up front wife has waded through enough of my scifi preference i feel i owe it to her sometimes i can be happily surprised this was not one of those timesmy biggest complaint is it just wasnt good i sat through a lot of greys anatomy and while much of it was cringe worthy some of the story arcs were interesting i probably gave up on that show after no less than  years maybe  i was shocked to learn it was still going strong a couple years ago but apparently people like it brdigerton is based on a novels that seem to be highly acclaimed which initially led me to believe i might enjoy the show i get the impression they seriously misfired on the original materiali have never been what anyone would consider a prude but i think a show better be able to stand on its story and the nudity should just be unnecessary window dressing this show will be fine for those looking for window dressing everyone else need not applymeanwhile we are really getting swamped in this  wokedom novels have always been the best medium for creativity but woke is destroying period fictionnonfiction unnecessarily series and films should be trying to create the settings as laid out by the author or go write your own material it would be just as distracting if kunta kinte first ran into the slavers in the forest it was jack nicholson out hunting a guinea as fine an actor as jack nicholson obviously is he would have ruined that film rather the producers would have should they have made that casting decisioni am not going on to episode  show gets a  because production quality and actors do well
"simply in love with seeing this adaptation of one of my favorite series
especially the fact of bringing black characters this is incredible we need to see ourselves at the top too do not get attached to the historical period your racism will not pass"
"i did not know the books but i am a fan of the jane austin movies so i was really waiting for this
and i love it
it took a bit to get used to the unusual form but this series delivered everything i was hoping for great costumes actors you like  love a story you could feel with in fact i loved the series so much i bought the first book by julia quinn
i did not like the book so i will not read the other  books but i do hope that netflix will give us  more seasons of bridgerton
thanks for so much fun"
season  was amazing obvi but season  i rewound the ending  times after finishing the first time just because it was that good when he finally said the l word i died after completing season  i also immediately went to amazon and purchased the entire  books please watch season  and  with an open mind its not a traditional period piece but thats what makes the series so special enjoy
this is the first new shoes in years that ive been interested in who cares about the historical accuracy of the costumes or the casting its fiction
folks this is fantasy shonda rhimes and company are presenting an alternative universe version of britains regency period in which yay hotties of all races gleefully ripped each others bodices all the while dressed in absolutely fantastic clothesoverall this is escapist guilty pleasure fun yet the series also finds time for some historical truths amid the fantasy most of all the way young women were herded ignorant and unsuspecting into marriage back then given no choices in life except to marry as well as possible and spend their lives as baby machines also the way a whiff of scandal one innocent mistake could destroy an entire familys reputationcome on guys and gals loosen your corsets and have some fun though for heavens sake dont watch this with your parents
there is nothing good in this show acting is horrible characters are dry and underdeveloped who is watching this how low our iq should be to accept this  development on the story  character development stupid dialogue
so many bad reviews based on the brilliant diversity and lack of historical accuracy  its so refreshing to see people of many ethnicities playing all parts and not just the below stairs characters  in my opinion good acting and chemistry between the main protagonists  i havent read the book so cant comment but loved the fun of it especially the quartet playing billy eilish  hang on  she wasnt around in  either  scandalous
"bridgerton ohh wow before i go on i feel the need to explain that im a typical man i like action and comedy keeping fit and drinking beer i dont really do chick flicks or romance but bridgerton  upon watching it at my wifes request  grabbed  of my attention
its set brilliantly in an almost tongue in cheek take on the regency period some other reviews have pointed out the mixed races of various families that would be unrealistic in that era in london but for me all the parts were acted well and so i cant say i noticed the charecters are believable and thats all i took from them the balance of romance and duty  conflict in this show are perfect whilst some tituations had me laughing others had me yelling just kiss her at the screen  and im not easy to excite every episode leaves you wanting more its simply beautiful its fun just when you think netflix have exhausted every genre up pops something entirely new
im not sure how anyone can be leaving poor reviews for this show its funny romantic dark at times a completely refreshing piece thats completely different to anything else around at the moment all the loose ends seemed to be tied up at the end of the season but if s does get made ill be waiting eagerly"
"i had read the books a long time ago and when i saw the trailer for the first i couldnt believe they were being adapted into a series i was nervous at first because adaptions rarely match the expectations of fans and this genre of books are well never really adapted
having now finished watching the series i would say i loved it the series is very engaging and fun the diverse cast was distracting at first and difficult to ignore but by second episode it made sense and made the series even better the casting for daphne was perfect i could see myself falling in love with her character she acted so well
the only thing that left me wanting was that i would have loved to see more of london of that time through their eyes"
im obsesses with this i feel in love with the chemistry between daphne and simon
i saw this series and despite being a little different from the book i liked very mutch the resemblance is incredible and perfect in some scenes and the differences between the book and the series are necessary to make the plot more vividi do love this series and became perfect
the script was so bad that i kept watching thinking it must be a satire clearly it was not it was just bad writing  and often equally bad acting at times i felt embarrassed for the cast totally apart from the colorblind casting some of the casting was just awful perhaps it was because the writing was so bad some of the actors demonstrated no range at all  one expression one emotion i continued watching because a friend recommended it to me but now i feel like a fool having wasted eight hours of my life
i admit ive come late to the bridgerton party but its worth a look just to swoon at regejean page and his chemistry with a spoon why some viewers are angry about this reimagining of history is beyond me its no downton abbey but its not trying to be it is more a modernized blend of pride and prejudice and hamilton sans the hip hop you have luscious costumes and contemporary music made classical interwoven throughout the series you know the duke and daphne are made for each other but its interesting to see how they eventually get there whats refreshing is that race is no real construct in how the upper crust in society relate to one other theres a few mentions on how bridgerton became a blended society but otherwise its not a factor of influence and why should it be simply put except for some in society who view the duke as a rake he is not treated or perceived as less than anyone because of his race rather hes higher in society due to his rank so women and their mothers clamor for his favor this colorblindness may be why some find the series provocative or uncomfortable a black man playing the romantic lead is not what viewers are used to seeing but its worth a look for this reason alone and to watch the dukes love for daphne and a very blessed spoon
i am a romantic soul and anything that moves butterflies im my gut  is worth watching it is light refreshing and entertaining obvious chemistry between the main characters historical logic was not needed the message is  love if you wish to escape reality relax your brain from heavier movies and just chill i dont see why wouldnt you enjoy it
i love the series is it an exact retelling of the books of course not books are never translated perfectly to screen but this takes a beloved series and gives it enough of a twist to watch it as an entirely new product its modern with its pop tunes turned into classical pieces and colorblind casting but it also gives us a glimpse at the harsh reality women faced in both high society and otherwise the dialogue between characters shares some of that even more than the books did regency romances tend to glamorize the past and the shows reminds us that while things are visually beautiful the reality often was not
having read all of the bridgerton books i can say this series is wonderful the characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors and have brought something more to each i cannot wait to see what they do with the rest of julia quinns characters for those who have issue with casting just stop as readers we have the ability to imagine characters any way we wish and to see such a diverse group of actors bring these characters to life is impressive i am going to reread the series with the bonus of having more depth to each character as a result of this first season well done to all
i loved this movie they truly did the book justice i have loved julia quinns books and this movie was wonderfully done i can not wait for the second season which will hopefully be anthony and kates story
sad another telling of a story about how bad rich th century british people were
thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of the books the sets locations and costumes were visually stunning the actors embodied the characters we have come to love and i loved the diversity of the cast it should be noted that there were many poc in the regency period and queen charlotte was actually a person of mixed ethnicity there was also a black duke who was a member of the european aristocracy there were also many marriages of mixed ethnicity its a pity that history doesnt do more to highlight poc instead of surpressing these details leading many uninformed of historical accuracy
just really enjoyed watching this even though its not without its flaws really good cast and the queens wigs alone deserve a bafta 🙌🏻
first  this in not a portrayal of history this is set in the regency era and is based on a series of books by julia quinn that follows the relationships of the bridgerton familyif you are expecting an accurate portrayal then keep looking if you enjoy regency romance and can accept the fact that the directorproducersscreenwriters took liberties to make it appealing to a wider range of audience i think you will enjoy it if youre a fan of regency romance then i urge you to check out the book series
i finished the show in one day i saw it with my sister we both liked the idea of the s i mean who wouldnt want to live in those years the duke is simply so mysterious which makes the show even better because the more minutes you see from the show the more you learn about him and his past you have to see this show its one of my favorites and im sure youll like it too
this show was everything weve been missing on tv lately yes it has a diverse castget over it i was amazed how beautiful the cast was and it being diverse only made the show better in my eyes i havent read the books so i cant talk about how true to the story it is but i loved this story i binged it in one day i couldnt stop watching i loved all the little nuances the backdrop the actors were amazing i say you go watch this show and enjoy how the world should have looked from the very beginning
season  was  but season  was terrible the acting sucked there was no comedy the romance was boring the story line was predictable in the worst way very disappointing
i absolutely loved the new characters fit perfectly into the plot and the iconic scenes from the book are all present
absolutely loved it love the diversity i cant wait to see more of it
absolutely loved bridgerton the story telling was awesome they way these characters stories were told was amazing the narration of the show chefs kiss and the acting was spectacular many of the actorsactresses on the show were new to me sorry i tend to live under a rock but their performances were awesome also the chemistry between the two leads whew amazing all i have to say is that i rarely watch romance shows but i loved this one netflix knew what they were doing the moment they got shondaland to sign with themupdateseason  bumped my score up to a  kate sharma  anthony bridgerton are perfection i am obsessed and i cannot lie their story is better than daphne and simons sorry not sorry
ill be honest this show is not the kind of show i normally watch i normally have a simple list of criteria to help me decide what to watch i usually only watch shows or movies if it has two or more of the following spaceships aliens time travel cool weapons advanced technology swords and other ancient weapons good action martial arts hot actresses superpowers story set during ancient or medieval timesso while this wasnt really the usual kind of genre that i would watchthe trailers i saw did show some action duels boxing etc and hot actresses phoebe dynevor is like a younger hotter deborah ann wohli gave it a chanceand i was slowly drawn in by the very interesting story and twists and surprises about high society life in th century london its very interesting to learn about life in the ton for girls whove come of age and the boys whove come to inherit their fathers titles and the challenges associated with thesethe costumes and sets look very authentic the cast is very talented the story will pull you ini cant wait for season  now though im kind of glad they revealed the identity of lady whistledown at the end instead of leaving us hanging for a year until next season
i actually think this series is a solid  but i gave it  stars to help balance out the baffling star user reviews there is nothing whatever wrong with the series its beautifully done in every waygorgeous costumes lavish sets clever writing good acting and compelling characters who on earth gives something like this a star review is there some kind of vendetta going on here that i dont know about this is fiction people its a charming creative romance very loosely based on some historical facts is there something wrong with that watch a documentary if you want historical accuracy this is entertainment and very enjoyable entertainment at that im enjoying it immensely and look forward to each episode i was delighted when a second season was just announced i hope there may be many more to follow
it started out as a ish out of  quirky and whatnot reminded me of pride and prejudice but after around  episodes daphne became unbearably more annoying way more than she already has the leading pair had no chemistry to start with and later in the show it became just sex and then fights about having a child it was incredibly dragged out and agonizing to watch and interesting characters like eloise or benedict have close to no screentime i really wanted to like penelope aswell and i feel so sorry that the writers made her character the dullest and most clichee ugly friend with unavailable love interest etc and most of the time i just pitied her all in all the writers have failed to create any likeable characters at all and the two and a half likeable ones had too little screen time for the viewer to get attached to them the mere conversation between the leads are infuriating theyre both talking as other were a wall also idk about you guys but i was expecting prettier costumes than the ones shown atleast the dresses their form irritated me oh and two stars are for eloise and benedict and nothing more
its been  years since i saw something that i would wanna write a review about it season  its so worth it in the beginning k didn t wanna give it a change cause the msin characters of season  where left offbut after the first episode when they meet on the horses i saw it all in a dayi have  childrenso i prefered it than my sleep the acting of the couple is amazing anx i would like to see them win an award next yearit was truly eoth my time
"i believe not all shows require to be complicated or following a mysterious story line
i have read many people were talking about its contradictions with the history at that time but it is a romance its not a documentary
i absolutely loved and enjoyed watching this show shonda always makes the audience really engaged as like greys anatomy will highly recommend this show if you are after a chilled smooth beautiful and gossipy drama
really liked the choice of the actors"
cant wait for the next series easy to watch and i couldnt stop watching 
id say this series is one part love story from a womans perspective one part contemporary and one part idealist future world where race is almost a nonissue
season one for me was quite captivating the wardrobes sets acting pace and story line all fabulous i could hardly wait for this second seasonand it was without a doubt meh i was underwhelmed i kept watching with the hopes that it would improve but it didntthe pace of the main characters story was off to me also there where noticeable holesbut tge biggest one where the heck was simon he should have been there to support his friend when he opened his gentlemens club and definitely shouldnt have missed his brother in laws wedding  which was given by the queen no lessoverall i am a fan but a disappointed onei pray that a season three will follow and put it all right again
bad acting combined with no real storytelling this could have had so mich potential but it seems like its been written by a yo
eu amei demais a fotografia os atores e o roteiro nao ficou cansativo e maratonei mesmo tudo em um dia vem segunda temporada logo caraiiii
this is the best you must watch it
the series is just perfect a gift for book fans as the adaptation captured the essence of the story and all the important references are there im looking forward to the second season
i wasnt really interested in watching second season the first was fun but got pretty silly as it went along to where i lost interest by the end seems they ran out of things to write and just plugged sex scenes in everywhere at the end and i was tired of simon and daphne i did however love penelope and eloise so gave the second season a go when i had nothing else to watch then couldnt stop the second season in my opinion was far better less ridiculous and turns out main characters of kate and anthony are so much better such good chemistry and acting plus felt they expanded eloises character more
held your attention which is impressive given that not a lot happens some of the characters could have been developed more but no doubt there will be further series thought the overall storyline around the oath a little weak
its the early s in england and like  of the upper class in the show are black it is so absurd that it is distracting and makes it hard to watch i put diversity in quotes as it isnt actual diversity just adding black people if were going to make some weird past that never existed might as well throw in some asians or latin americans maybe a native american imagine how weird it would be to make a movie about african tribes from  years ago and  of the chieftains and warriors are pasty british guys i dont mind changing races for scifi or fantasy etc but real historic time periods so silly
"just like any adaptation changes happen and when it comes to bridgertons they were very welcome black people feminist speeches and real problems
even people who didnt know the books are getting attached to the characters we can only ask for a second season"
its been a long time since i watched a good romantic drama and im quite surprised to see low ratings for this show im not familiar with source materials so im not going to compare each the most admirable thing about this show is the way they mix modern music with classical music the plot is a normal period romance story but the execution of the story is great in the beginning i was worried the pace is gone to be slow but guess what the pace is perfect im sure you are gone enjoy this show so much as i do the first half of the season mainly focused on our main two characters but in the second half of the season there are few subplots that are good to see im getting bored with romance drama when they focused on just the main couple this is my first time seen these two performances and they did a great job i really enjoyed their acting they have great chemistry on screen also the supporting cast is good especially the queen the only negativity i see is the predictability of the show writers should have done better with the mystery of lady whistledown i notice half of the season who is lady whistledown i am looking forward to the second season and i recommend this especially if you are a fan of romantic period drama
"is a great story really well made and enjoyable to watch i think the actors all did a great job and is really refreshing to see people of color in period stories
and if you are mad about that last thing then stay mad and quiet thanks"
imagine what the world would be like now if the experiment had taken place some two centuries agowhy is it that all the haters want the show to be something it is not take it for what it isguilty pleasure the departure from reality is fantastical just as dr who and certainly has the potential for an equally dedicated cult following i hope the show will go on for as many decades and portray many generations to comethe gossip and scandal are done with intrigue and finesse and the overthetop costumes are pure delight having seen charlotte and rewatched the first two seasons i cannot wait for more
i dont get why there are so many bad reviews i loved this series and all og the characters in it i hope we will get a season 
ok to make up a black queen even though it is ridiculous for that time but why the heck is it so difficult to follow the story line of the books they are well written and quite entertaining without needing to enhance with silly side plots or change the main story line or dont call it bridgerton
"i have not read the book and knew nothing about it and i was not sure i would even like the series since im not really into romantic seriesmovies but i gave it a chance after seeing the trailer and from episode one i couldnt stop watching i loved everything about it the characters the music the clothing the story it made me both smile and cry at times eloise is my absolute favourite character i cant wait for season 
i dont get the criticism about it not being historically accurate for me it was just a story in an alternative universe if you want i once read a book with similar era describes but it was set in the future on another planet with aliens stories are stories im not sure i would even like it if it was historically accurate watch it for what it is a made up story if you like romantic drama you will probably enjoy it"
two friends become the it couple pretending to be in love but will low self esteem and niavete and fear tear them apartwho is lady whistle down and will the queen and eloise be able to unmask him or her stay tuned to find out
love this adaptaption of the first book is it true to the book  no but it keeps the original vibe of fun and sassy and keeps a viewer entertained watched the whole season in one sitting
wonderful and really keeps you on your toes for real a very good watch to curl up on the couch
i really enjoyed it and think it was a great watch defoe one for the girls who love a good chick flick kinda series everyone has there own taste in filmsseries so my advise is to give it a go and see what you think bad reviews have never put me off and nor will they 
for the love of all that is holy this was absolute garbage a dumpster fire of the first order the diction was pure drivel the plot was flimsy at best predictable doesnt begin to describe how formulaic this series was the garishness of the period dress was laughable the romantic scenes were something that could have come from a s high school movie like porkys and please dont even get me started about the actress who played the queen she had more wigs than rip taylor who would have been a better queen than the actress they had and this lady danbury  she looked like she raided princes closet and was ready to go clubbing the only and the rock means only bright spot was jonathan bailey who could maybe pass for a young hugh jackman otherwise it was bad poor waste of time do yourself a favor and avoid this at all costs
i havent read the book so i watched the show with no expectations at all and i loved it i absolutely cannot wait for season 
i love the adaptation let the second season come
"love the show cant wait for nd series
great choice in cast"
"lots of people are being negative re this show
i wont be for the most part my main critique was the music i didnt like it i dont think it fitted into the timeline i was also not enamoured by the gratuitous sex scenes i personally dont think they were necessary
i really really enjoyed this fictional story though and that is what it is a fictional story set in a specific period of history it is not a historic retelling though i could care less that there were black actors playing non stereotypical caricatures the story was enjoyable the acting good i was left wanting more after each episode
the set designs were the stand out for me though it was a visual treat looking at the flowers and lights that were everywhere especially during the parties
if you are looking for something to binge on then this can be enjoyed over a weekend enjoy it for what it is and not for what you think it should be it is harmless fun"
the bridgerton isnt the same without the duke of hastings but i have to say that for some reason i liked the second season more than the first one i saw anthony with a different point of view compared to the first season everyone deserves true love
i like the story line and the acting the problem is it is very hard to watch an historical drama if i can call this one when someone is imposing their desire for diversity and inclusion on a series like this in no way would the population at the time especially in higher society have been this racially mixed so one ends up feeling as if the producersdirector tried way too hard and it comes across like a cheap shot it also feels forced badly done
superb acting costumes and sets some might say a bit too girly but as a guns and blast them up male viewer this series is enjoyed by both my wife and myself
"i am a big fan of the book series and i was not disappointed at all my husband and i binges the whole season in one night and ibhave no regrets 😄
some things have been changed but thats only natural in a different format i think shonda rimes did a fantastic job with this season and i really look forward to more"
"this is not your mothers period drama piece
this is so much moreyes the costumes are not historically accurate did that take away from the show maybe for you but in the vein of coppolas marie antoinette it very much displayed the lavishness and possibility that period clothing could be more the costume design team has made a masterpiece it was a genuine pleasure to see such intricate and breathtaking pieces shown from the queens court dress to daphnes blue morning dress  they are beautiful simply putyes there are black aristocrats aside from the main hero portrayed by regéjean page which is not entirely historically accurate does this change the character his motivations no hes still simon does the fact that there are black aristocrats get addressed yes in a very moving speech from the mindblowingly perfect portrayal of lady danbury adjoa andohyes its not familyfriendly in the traditional sense of the ratings system does this take away from the perfectly executed family scenes between the bridgerton siblings no it does not to quote lady violet bridgerton ruth gemmell we like each other and that is something that is integral from the books and is now in the showas someone who has watched many period pieces and suffered through the uncomfortable mansfield park  these actors and actresses are worlds apart its fresh and dramatic and exactly what i would expect from the combined talents of julia quinn shanda rimes and chris van dusenwhile im just another fan and one who has watched pride and prejudice  one too many times i can confidently say that this is my favorite period drama is it because its newly released dramatic a visual joy no because many other period pieces i could say the same forits because in every aspect of the show they have modernized the story but in subtle ways that do not overpower the larger scope of the show the excellent cinematography and set design diversity in casting scripting in a way that isnt right out of austen and the score i could wax poetic and write another  words on the score and audio alone kris bowers you are so very talented and as my best friend as my witness i had to pause and go on a ten minute excited rant about the track that i now know and have downloaded simon and lady danburyat the end of the day dont take my word for it form your own opinion if its not your cup of tea then go get a juice box"
its a beautiful storyline based on the british lifestyle with a little bit spice and a great love story with innocence trust me it give you some fresh air after a decade of nothing good
i havent seen such a good show in a long time it only took me a day to finish it all i can say is that i cant wait for season 
dont you hate it when they bring one of your beloved books to the screen and throw out all your favorite private momentsbecause they think tv audiences want flash and trashbridgerton gets the tv treatment so hard its unrecognizable glitzy gowns and coronets oh plentyfabulous interiors and servants galorebut charm no its like a ride in a romcom themeparktake for example the pall mall croquet game in episode  instead of granting viewers  along with the other characters  the time to discover how each person reveals character in play the writers spoil it by telling us everything ahead of time hes this shes that etc all thats left to do as the game proceeds is to check mental boxes  yes yes yes so dullpens story is boring and eloises is artificial the story of the club is totally empty of drama as for anthony and kate even when they get down and dirty theyre animatronicmoreover what isnt sentimentalized and crude is brazenly lifted from past series  like anthonys dunking which reproduces colin firths dip in ppso do yourself a favor watch episode  then fastforwardp s cowper is pronounced cooper but hey what do americans knowp p s alternatively add some spice  since jonathan bailey anthony is gay  by turning kate into kit
is the best is so beautiful you must see it immediately you wont regret it
the characters are so cool and the actors play very well even convinced me that i wanted to live in the s
bridgerton is full of surprises with a lot of romance comic relief powerful speeches and striking scenes we have a series with a plot and captivating actors it certainly differs from books but nothing that a good fan cannot love it is incredible to be able to see the whole history of the most fertile family in society coming to life
this is series is so much fun i absolutely adored it i shared my enthusiasm about this series with my friends and weve all raved about the bridgertons we cant wait to see which couple the writers will focus on next and tell their stories of scandals and romance praying for a second third and fourth season to come
if you are in the mood for something mindless and light during these trying times  give this escape a try dont overthink it i really dont understand the  ratings at all  wondering about the validity of those repeated reviews its not pride and prejudice but entertaining and visually well done i thought the casting and acting was very good and appreciated the modern twists
could only watch the first  minutes the acting is terribleand if a story cant grab you in the first  minutes it wont ever
i was enchanted in the first episode im completely in love i cant wait for the second season
i just love it for me this is one of the best tv series i have ever watched i highly recommend to watch and enjoy with it second season is my favourite but the first is also awesome
the actors  actress for this series is the best i love every episode  cant wait for season  wow what a great job please have a series  this should win alot of awards for sure💖💖💖
i enjoyed this series very much i almost did not watch until i got to the end of episode one i enjoy all the characters and and the string quartet playing contemporary music
such a creative concept of a period piecefamily drama mixed with historically inaccurate features such as the representation of all ethnicities in the upperclass and beautiful renditions of modern songs even though the end of the seasons is at least thus far pretty predictable each episode managed to capture my interest a series for the culture which definetely has contributed to a certain revival of the fashion of that time
everyone is talking up this show but its very overrated not like gossip girl at all
i dont write reviews but after reading the negative reviews i felt i needed to tell everyone the truth i have never read the books and i like history but i dont know all of history but i loooooove tv and a good romance this show is one of the very few shows where i literally cannot stop looking at it and cannot turn it off the chemistry between the main characters on this show was absolutely phenomenal i feel like anyone who enjoyed downton abbey would love this show it has a similar feel
a must watch history and fiction meet for pure entertainment i loved the idea of the s coming to life with many people who were different looking forward to session 
these reviews are ridiculously rude and idiotic its a romance show that is supposed to keep you wanting more and more because their love is so tangible and when their not together you cant stand it the show does exactly what its supposed to do and instead of being happy that the whole cast isnt white as usual now everyone is complaining about historical inaccuracies and that its ridiculous some people will literally never be happy i loved this show so much because i am a true romantici usually get bored with period pieces but not this one i loved daphne and simon i loved all the characters its amazing im sad its over and i cant wait for another season
i love british movies and tv services from pride and prejudice anything from  time period this tv seriesfrom netflix addes a twist it was captivating i read the book usually the book is always better but this series was better than the book it makes you want to see again and again cant wait to see the next series
this show brought me to life it is so good the characters are so likeable and the diverse cast is amazing truly an amazing show hoping for a season two
like watching a high school play no historical accuracy horrific acting what a waste of time
muito bem adaptada roteiro incrível fotografia impecável e o elenco é maravilhoso um elenco diverso e representativo o que atualmente é essencial nas produções
"the best show in 
the actors are so good in ther jobs that i feel i was living with them"
i was shocked to see the bad reviews on here i adored every moment of this series and i am greatly looking forward to season  yes it is very loosely based on a well loved book series which i have read dozens of times do i care no it was great fun and had all the feels fabulous bring on season 
the series is amazing a litle difference to the books but in this format it was incririble
my husband and i enjoyed it it was cute funny and easy to watch i think other people just took it to seriously to enjoy it either they hate love or never loved at all
i have nothing against black actors and actresses but using them in period dramas like this when there were none present in aristocratic families or the nobility of the era is as logical as having one of them whip out a cell phone this spoils the show for me
outstanding i see many possibilities for the story lines i cant wait for the next season love the story and actors and actresses
i have not read the booksbut watched this on netflix i was swept away is it a true period piece no i found it refreshing to see the diversity in the cast only in episode  or  do we come to understand the socialcultural mix for the piece the characters are lively the banter is funny when needed and serious when necessary this is a love story and an epic one the tortuous seduction between the main characters is a beautiful thing to watch how simon treats daphne when they finally consummate their union is the stuff of fairy tales every young girl dreams of this kind of first time he the experienced lover and she the eager trusting bride so is it a fantasy yes and a good one
this is great although i havent read the books 
ive read a lot of these reviews and the criticism they contain but wonder how many people ventured past the first episode which was somewhat overwhelmed by all the superficial flash employed as an early attentiongrabber the first half of episode  seems a confused jumble of excess rather than an introduction to character and story making me question if it would settle and actually not be crap but gradually it began to extricate itself tone things down and draw the viewer inby episode  the only truly irritating thing for me was the voiceover of julie andrews as lady thistledown a silly attempt at aping dame edith evans as lady bracknell every other anomaly  the ethnicity of some elements of the ruling classes the unlikely modern fabrics and patterns the orchestral arrangements of current popular music the duke dressed as though he is about to take to the stage at the swan theatre to play romeo  all these things exist alongside what we expect from a traditional period piece without replacing them and it only needs a small shift of perception one click of the kaleidoscope and everything falls into placethis isnt period drama based on strict rules of time and place but set in a time and place that has been reimagined occupied by people who are different but the same  backwardlooking forwardlooking trapped by convention ignoring convention struggling with moral dilemma and hoping for rescue all within the shifting landscape of a society where everyone competes to belong but noone is truly safethis is not period drama infected with modern woke ideas either as some have accused just about every societal repression you can think of is there just as it would normally be in a traditional telling interestingly the cast some of whom seem to belong in other eras conveyed by their behaviour and dress all seamlessly occupy the same story their triumphs and disasters are those of any time their concerns and problems those of any centurythe story takes the usual romantic twists and turns plus a few unconventional ones which are explored and resolved inventively the performances are good although one or two of the minor characters could have been better the leads are an engaging pair and their dilemma preposterous but entertaining and absorbing this series was wellplotted and gained more assurance with every episode which is why i think it a shame so many gave up too early wrote  star reviews and dismissed it for historical inaccuracieslighten up its not a history lesson and whatever colour people are whatever clothes they are wearing the fact the queen is seen in the bath when that would have been equally unlikely  its a tale told with style that follows the usual path of english period drama while giving it a mischievous tweak at the same time the result is a glorious mix that is well worth watchingid give it  stars but for the annoying julie andrews so its a  from me
the trolls are throwing a fit because the fabulous shonda rhimes made bridgerton with a diverse cast this is an impeccable show the casting the writing the directing the costumes the sets the lighting everything about it is just wonderful shonda hit this one out of the park its a fictional story yes its a period piece but so is hamilton starring a puerto rican aham and a black aburr i would not change a thing about the tony winning cast of hamilton i wouldnt change a thing about bridgerton its a delight to watch you will laugh you will cry your senses will just soak up the beauty of the show i hope we see more diverse casting in the future this show is not supposed to be historically accurate so get over yourself and just enjoy a delightful well executed show
if you have nothing to watch and are looking for some casual teenage heartthrob trash tv this is it the only surprise is its not set in a highschool but rather in the victorian era the story had me cringing at every step with almost too frequent sex scenes there is no villan or remotely likeable character just a bunch of annoying people making absurd and nonsensical decisions and having sex while doing it
does who dislike are just not right for this gerne i guess which fine but if you love some romance in any way possible this is the one ive binged it it was fabulous im hungry for more while being sad its done
couldnt stop watching hopeful for another season of this great cast and intriguing story line definitely racy so caution to those with tender sensibilities
"absolutely stunning production with incredibly talent and easy in the eye cast
so bingeworthyeasy to watch engaging and just beautiful tvdont get bogged down with all the miserable people giving this great series low ratingsthey obviously take themselves way too seriously and dont know how to relax and have a little funthis is not a historically accurate show its not trying to be if you want facts and no fun maybe read a book and take your arrogance somewhere else"
im giving this a higher rating than i should not because of the storylines predictable but because of the lead actor im a  year old white woman and all i can say is yumee
"i love the endless lovestory i know im hopeless i love the beautiful surroundings where the film is shot and not least the beautiful acting
but the best thing is definitely their language its wonderful to listen to if only we spoke like that today"
period piece where fantasy paints a picture of equality sexual desire and romance for our modern day pop culture original score of artists like maroon  ariana grande and et al covered by a classical quartet to help fit the modern narrative shows like this are just pure rubbish shallow and brain washingif you want to make a modern day teen drama then do so but there is no reason to take it back to the year  and use historical figures as a gateway to a false narrative it just an awful ideathe costumes were awesome hence  star
this drama based on a famous series of books is often hailed as not just one of the more popular and talked about shows of recent years  but also very acclaimed as one of the best and for good reasonwithout having read the novels as of yet this show indeed conveys its period drama splendidly whilst also adding some artistic and unique interesting liberties along the way the actors all do an incredible job very career defining and some you very much hope to see more of conveying a vast range of emotions and humour sharply written and paced indeedthe cinematography cutting and editing is great and the series features some overall stellar imagery and costumes works very beautifully put togetherdefinitely a highly recommended show
i dont know why there are so many negative reviews the show is fun colorful and very similar to hamilton in that its a modern cast in a historical setting if you like period pieces jane austin romance novels hamilton gossip girl which to be honest ive never watched but it theres a storyline that is what i expect gossip girl to be or even just shondaland shows then i recommend giving it a go
" the cast is amazing every character is strongly played and has its proper place in the story
 the plot is good no didnt read the books although the identity of ms w became obvious around d part
 yes we finally got pride and prejudice with sex still a sex quite politely shown like a sex a normal lucky couple would have the leading couple looks amazing together
 atmosphere is amazingthis is a review from someone coming from a country which never went to other countries and brought slaves from there so neither do we have any history of rasism or segregation nor do we have any issues with using the word black nor fancy multiracial casting in historical dramas all people i know simply find it awkward as most people in this world will find awkward a black father having a white son in a hamlet production or white people playing korean scholars in a historical dorama or nonwhite people in the british high society in  it is also quite annoying to see everywhere all these hateful and victimized comments about white modern people being obliged to be ashamed all the time of something they never did especially the white heterosectual man obviously and even being obliged to change their history on screen
still if this is the way for american society to deal with its trauma they have the right to do it anyway they please
with me being annoyed at blind casting in historical movies yes everyone is really really tired of american social traumas and pursue of some perfect tolerance working for everyone and avoiding this series for quite a long time i watched it and i totally forgot about blind casting in  mins this is the power of culture and talent i even got respect for this way of social psychotherapy"
if you dont like the cover for the tv show please dont watch it this is for people who want to have a fun time and marvel about the cimetagrophy the customes and the pleasure of seeing a fantasy world with attrctive acors of diverse background if you dont like to see an imaginary world where white and black people have equal status do not watch it if you dont like romance and steamy sexy scenes do not watch it if yoi dont like period fictional dramas do not watch it for everybody else who knows how to enjoy a reallly good tv show whose only goal is to entertain then this is for you thank you to the team of bridgerton and shondaland for bringing this show the ride was fully entertaining
this show is surrounded by a yearning romance and scandal that leaves the viewer wanting more you find yourself yearning for the couple and you feel the tension as if its your own and that takes a great writer and director having so many stories building in one show sets up what ever comes next i love all the seasons so far but i want more of this couple i cant get enough the chemistry that the actors and actresses had was beautiful and the story was so well written the director really did an amazing job capturing each not only the intense sexual tension but also the heart break and troubles that each story carried you can empathize and sympathize with each character in some way this series is amazing
if youre expecting another downton abbey look elsewhere the characters are one dimensional dare i say cartoonish the plot could have been borrowed from any number teen dramas i was mildly interested during the first two episodes but the same silly stuff kept being passed off as plot development finally fell asleep watching i cant even work upthe motivation to dissect it further i guess the shonda magic is wearing thin
"this show is great from start to finish i was hooked as was everyone else i know there is a brilliant display of diversity and it is nice to see actorsactresses many of them at the beginning of their career it has the brilliance of being adult enough to show the taboo of regular period dramas but does so in a way that allows romance and escapism sure people may say there is little historical correctness but the bigger picture is that it is a beautiful series does it have some flaws perhaps every brilliant show does but i thought it to be amazing and i cannot wait to see season 
also one word simon"
i havent enjoyed watching a show this much in years it has all of the ingredients of a great show romantic elegant fun sexy great script and perfect casting amazing music luscious sets and costumes beautiful sweeping visuals while bridgerton is the first in its genre to veer sharply into steamy territory it doesnt feel cheap thanks to talented actors and a strong plot the use of modern songs performed by a string quartet is simply genius and the music feels like a truly important component theres an element of mystery with the identity of lady whistledown which makes it great fun i also admire what they did with the diverse cast its not meant to be historically accurate but an imagined and better world cannot wait for season 
its nice to watch something so different with so much diversity to anything else on tv i truely allow myself to be so absorbed that i let myself forgot about the outside world for awhile light hearted  witty with a twist of scandal and betrayal and exquisite frocks to boot love it 👍🏼
hands down great show personally in a group of  women who all have suggested it dont take these few  stars for anything more than pettiness
its disheartening so many people gave this show bad ratings because of the color of the actors i have not read the books but loved how they were able to rewrite it to include a diverse cast the book is completely fictional so changing it around to be a juicy diverse love story brings in more viewers this was not meant to be a historical representation of the s for myself seeing people of color play queens dukes etc was so nice and refreshing to see because our history was taken from us biopics are cast to represent the true identity of a character and fictional stories are made for rewriting to bring in the masses so if you cant see past the color you need to take a deep look at the yourself as a person because you really missed out on a great show blacks asians latinos can play any role in a fictional show and guess what it does not change history but im sure it made a young child of color smile to see people who look like them get cast for a role they normally wouldnt get cast for
historical inaccuracies aside i really only have two problems with this show it is basically nothing like the book seriesand it is bloody boring stars for beautiful costumes sets and some interesting acting
i liked both seasons on one and two this is a guilty pleasure show i dont think too much about historical accuracy or cultural appropriations when i watch it i just watch for fun and pleasure it is more enjoyable that way people exhaust me with the seriousness of their ratings lol just have fun with a tv show jeez
beautiful sets gorgeous costumes and each actor was brilliant my favourite was lady danbury whose regal imperious nature stole every scene i can see why this is the  show on netflix and it inspired me to read julia quinns books
ignore the negative reviews this is wonderful i dont even want to mention diversity but the fact that it pissed so many people off means our world is still a mess sit back and enjoy the sexy drama
no it might not be historically correct but greys anatomy isnt a real portrayal of hospitals amazing bingeworthy swoonworthy  boshed it in a weekend loved it
i really enjoyed this show loved it actually was it historically accurate nope but its a fictional series so not sure why it matters to be honest i didnt really get hooked until about episode  was it a perfect show no did i watch it all in  days yes was i sad when it was over very much yes daphne and simon had great chemistry and i loved their story each character i wanted to know even more about i laughed i cried i cannot wait for season  and the fact millions of people have streamed this speaks for itself give it a chance
i could only stomach the first  minutes of the first episode i could not get past the historical inaccuracy of having various ethnicities in high society and diplomatic positions it just didnt happen in the s in england sorry the narrator mimics the style of gossip girl to the t the acting and dialogue is atrocious the only positives are the sets and clothing it seems this show is to appease those in the pc culture that love having a diverse cast no matter what the context quality or subject is i have no issues with diversity but dont mix diversity with a historical setting that is grossly inaccurate
i thought it was just fantastic i cried smiled danced and fell in love definitely my favorite show of the year
its exactly what it claims to be a romance novel in tv series format i love the characters costumes music etc and the plot while that of a romance novel was fun and had some surpriseseveryone needs to calm down its all in good fun definitely gossip girl meets the bachelor meets jane austen
great acting perfect cast refreshing show this show needs season 
"its a great bit of fun harmless and entertaining
i dont know why it get such awful reviews
if you want historical fiction watch documentaries
we enjoyed it and was super relaxing
enjoy"
a true fan of julia quinn and the duke  i was my first book read in her bridgeton series and thoroughly enjoyed seeing the story come to live before my very eyes in shondanetflixs version of this beloved romance story loved everything about netflix the duke  i as the struggles were real for the mothers of girls as we had seen in pp w mrs bennett and making advantageous matches for their securities in a mans world  the duke  i delivered a stunning performance by a stellar cast of professional actors  lady danbury  lady whistledown are two forces to be reckoned with  the duke  i deliver on a story worthy of julia quinns imagination with pure visual delights  exquisite costumes stunning cinematography breathtaking choreography and a well written adaptation of jqs novel of the same name thank you shonda rhimes  netflix for allowing me to glimpse what the world of regency period may have looked like with all the delights and naughty bits  i loved seeing simons back story and watching him realize through the eyes of love from his wife daphne that he was a man of true worth  simon never stood a chance from the moment daphne bumped into literally at a ball  looking forward to seeing more of daphne  simon and the bridgertons pall mall game
as someone who hasnt read the books i would have loved it but unfortunately i read them an amazing thing about book adaptations is the power that directors producers and the behindthescenes team in general has to make something good or something bad into anything amazing but thats not what they did they took a masterpiece that is the viscount who loved me and simply changed everything and changed essential parts like the fact that kate only wants the good for her sister and edwina wants to please the family by marrying someone with money to lift them out of poverty and they turned a whole love and beautiful story into something petty they made kate look like a villain for taking anthony away from her sister and they made edwina look like an idiot for not seeing certain things it was all too badi must confess that some scenes were very good it was much better than in the book but to my displeasure they were just exceptions i dont think the series should be called bridgerton when the only thing in common are the names of the characters thats because many of them had sharp personality changes lady whistledown and all its plot the permanence of house names and the plot of enemies to lovers everything else changed it would be much nicer for them to make a novel of any period without any connection to the book
ive read the books a few years ago and was amused by its wit and interesting plots i was pleasantly surprised when i heard the books are finally being turned into a series i have to say i am also pleasantly surprised by the diverse cast and hope i see even more of that in the future yes this is not a dull british period series we already have plenty of those what we really needed was something light and funny and as further as possible from 
it is totally worth watching the whole season rating shows after watching just  episode should be forbidden
will bridgerton change the world or your life likely not that being saidit is a delightful distraction for the end of this year just what this doctor ordered
i havent been able to stop thinking about this show the characters are so loveable and well rounded each episode it just filled with scandal and romance and its so much fun to get caught up in it fantastic show
the season is brilliantlove the storythe cast paly their roles very beautifullyi think the best romamce season from netfilx is thislove it
all the raving reviews here say switch your brain off before watching perhaps i just dont know how to do that lol dont get me wrong im all for fun to watch garbage shows watched many of them on netflix etc but this was not fun at all riddled with cliches all over and what they tried to do with a mashup of gossip girl and jane austen and downton abbey  sex appeal doesnt work one bit it is actually more like an insult if you happened to watch downton abbey im also not against imagined reality but writers need to be consistent and crafty with it it worked in the great but it doesnt work here
obsessed with this show please please let there be a season  and more
such a wonderful period piece  it reminds of a marie antoinette lol but as a series i just love and the diversity in the cast is so refreshing and beautiful im obsessed with this 
i havent read the books but if youre looking for something extravagant and soapy look no further its like if gossip girl and pride and prejudice had a baby
obsessed i became very attached with each character and side story throughout the show cannot wait for season two beautiful music costumes acting and storylines im so hooked
forget about the historical perspective about this show because its a truly great and fun watch i enjoyed the characters because they have very distinct personalities and their own quirks i havent watched a show that truly captivated my attention and made me come back for more in a while this show historical enough for modern viewers to continue watching and not get bored
first off i would like to note that i love arianna grandes musicthat being said i am also a big fan of period television and series period pieces have a tendency to take you back to imagining how life was hundreds of years go this series initially drew me in because it looked like it was going to be a good oneeverything seemed alright while i watched the first episode but then half way into the episode i was very weirded out there is a scene where we see various violinists performing for the guests and these violinists started playing thank you by arianna grandefirst of all immediately i was ripped away from the fantasy of watching a period piece it ruined the feeling that i was gazing into the life of nobles and ladies in the s i was handed a very crude awakening that these characters were not in s england they were just playing dress up in the si forced myself to go through the experience thinking it was just a one off but then moments later the violinists started playing another popular song from   i dont remember the name it was at this moment that i simply turned off the show and decided never to watch it againas i said earlier its not that i dislike arianna grande i really like her music but when you are creating a show that is set in the s please dont ruin it by putting in modern day music it really rips the viewer out of trying to believe that what they are seeing really could have happenned in those times
i wait  ages for this and i love so much penélope  colin are the best couple forever
i love this seriesit has brought all the characters i love to life and i spent  hours enjoying the opulence of regency life the loving and maddening bridgerton family the scandals the extra story plots giving the characters more depth and of course the passionthe creators have made a brilliant job of bringing julia quinns stories to life and giving a fresh enticing feel to themi will always love the books but this series has made them come more alive in my imagination nownow for the long wait of series 
better than my expectation i have to admit the story flow quite good enough whilst the casts are not the superior good looking but lovely  adoring cant wait to watch the season 
a very good drama you can enjoy drama genre lovers can surely give it a tryand its not everyones cup of tea
perfect the cast is the best wonderful to see my bridgertons all very beautiful
i watched it because i got super curious by all the hype made for this show god barely endured the first episode what is that really is it a past meets today kind of thing is it a mockery to the british royals a dark comedy some type of weird modern adaptation all i think of was cringey sorry the plot of the show is not bad actually but the executioncould have been way betteralso i couldnt comprehend what was all that hype and being at the top for weeks about even the chemistry between lead roles do not match
i just loved the series its perfect so far ive watched it twice since it premiered and the two times i watched the only thing i did was look underway to my computer screen the adaptation brought of course many changes but the essence remained the main couple is perfect simon is wonderful anthony cant say the same and i wish hed get better next season and that benedict and francesca have a real participation in the series not only in their respective seasons it is not possible for someone so to have liked this work
bridgerton is impeccable soundtrack actors story the s are magnificent and bringing her to the screens made everything more incredible the romance as it is portrayed together with the love of the family its brothers in all is an impeccable set it is worth highlighting the actors choices simon its perfect too anxious for a second season and anthonys story netflix  shonda  quite a hit i loved it
dont normally write reviews but such low scores need some balance never read the books didnt know about the controversial debates over casting until after i watched it tv is what you want it to be  in this case an escape from reality thats it i wasnt looking for a history lesson i wasnt looking for the meaning of life i was looking for a distraction on a cold winters evening  goal achieved i laughed i got annoyed with characters i fell in love with some characters and despised others its not going to be everyones cup of tea  but was something i and my daughter enjoyed together looking forward to season 
beautiful history and beautiful colorful l love this romance
it must be one of the first romances tv shows ive enjoyed so far firstly all actors and actresses are incredibly talented and take their character to another whole new levelbridgerton is refreshing addictive sexual and risky but on point drama mixed with romancewhile on season  the truth about romance is told exposing the british society season  brings the sexuality and chemistry into a different level
i knew id hate this show and i did any show that tries to lure an audience in with sex in a modern day vibe has to be lacking in everything else seems like its trying to do the stuff people thought was cool ten years ago explicit sex has become boring because theres too much of it stop lazily thinking its what the audience want maybe but it has to backed up with a good well directed story i hated this show i hate hearing scripts trying to sound modern when people clearly wouldnt have talked that way plus isnt all the hype around it suspiciously over the top
historical fantasy and period romance are a fantastic way to reimagine history episode  really hit me hard it gives you the imagery you always wantedcostumes are fantasticand then gives a depth i search for in reading romance books yeah i wasnt exactly sold on the main romancemostly for the woe is me whining of the privileged couple madly in love luckily you have a whole cast and menagerie of storylines to follow and invest in i cant wait to see what happens for these characters and i wholeheartedly love the boldness of saying what if we hadnt bound entire races of people in enslavement social inferiority and servitudewhere would we be today if we had had an equality movement nearly a century earlier also the queen is a kicka character and i could watch her comedic performances all daynot to mention her turn for the drama
i loved the series completely the way simon developed and how he was completely the same as the books the actors are completely wonderful i never imagined i would become a fan that easy the friendship of penelope and eloise captivated me from beginning to end completely true to the books
if you like sensual romances with great cast and amazing music incredible dressesit is your show you will fall in love
as someone who has not read the book i throughly enjoyed it dont listen to the bad reviews and give it a chancenot your typical drama
as did i i would never have watched this wonderful drama if i had listened to the critics i have not read the book so i am unable to vouch for its authenticity but as a viewer i was engrossed and captivated by the storylines costumes acting sumptious settings etc i binge watched the whole series and cannot wait for more many of the cast gave excellent performances the show is a big winner for me
"its common for some changes to works given budget and time restraints but it seems like every change to the story was because of some absurd pc ideology that undermines the whole point of the seriestheres nothing from the books besides the name
i think they did this cheesy poorly written and poorly acted fantasy nonsense and then bought the rights to the book and named this nonsense after themselves just dont waste your time im going to watch some jane austen movie to clear my eyes"
this period drama is the perfect mixture of gossip girl and jane austen the costume and sets are beautiful with stunning the plot is fantastical and so unexpected that it leaves you hanging in suspense at the end of each episode the conflicts and romance replicated in this period drama gives the watcher some historical perspective of great britain in the s whilst balancing it with a nice mix of romance including some steamy scenes
just enjoy this series for what it is the author has a great understanding of human nature and uses it explore all aspects of romantic relationships its something of a mystery to us even today we do want to fall in love to stay in love to find that love is the ultimate reason for a lifelong commitment in this piece piece we watch some fall by the wayside we see some endure none are perfect nor do they have to be but if you find it interesting to see so many factors contributing to and complicating peoples love life then this ones for you
the character development is extremely strong the plots are tantalising but the duke is the most frustrating human in the entire world
a witty subversive take on the regency romance genre the sets and costumes are sumptuous anachronisms abound but i didnt really care its a lot of fun just enter shondalands universe and enjoy
intriguing twists turns who knows who who said what excellent watch to do exactly what tv was made for to entertain takes you back to a time  place of history give it a try you wont be disappointed
yeah pretty much what everyone else is saying here every show these days has to make a statement but id rather remember the past and the vile attitudes people of that time had i dont want to see it glossed over like it never happened what next a ww movie where the holocaust never happened and everyone just gets alongplus the production on this series is a joke anyone else notice the yellow lines and parking bays on the road in the first episode lol how on earth did that get through postthe cgi cities look like an xbox game very flat and unrealistic lightingas for the story and acting yawn id need to be paid a large sum of money to sit through the rest of this drivel
this is a good entertainment as long as you do not take it seriously for a second and simply accept it as it is a good oldfashioned soap opera with no historical accuracy whatsoever lightweight superficial characters a feast of ballgowns and glamorous decor meaningless dialogue bodice ripping soft porn total escapism lap up every silly second lots of gorgeous male totty on display what a lovely way to get through life  simply throw a ball when all is looking desperate and gossip endlessly about all your neighbours i loved every silly nonsensical minute of it and moved on to queen charlotte immediately for more delightful tosh enjoy
its definitely watchable if you dont mind the repeated bonking towards the end which gets annoying after a while and there is no way on this earth that a regency duke would be talking to a debutant about masterbation if those two comments put you off then it is not for you i like the large non white casting except on one point which is referencing the king marrying a black woman where as queen charlotte was definitely not and she was also much more in love with her husband and genuinely distressed by his condition than this rather callous and wholeheartedly unlikable character is cast a a black women in the role but be colour blind to the casting as in david copperfield dont rewrite history to make a point if you want to understand a better history of the era then watch the madness of king george which is closer
sooo good every episode had me on the edge of my seat the costumes acting music everything was perfect i also think it is great how there seemed to be a hint of pride and prejudice i really hope the next season comes soon
i am having too much fun watching this show i love the diversity the costumes and cinematography are beautiful its not something to watch with kids in the room ladies so make sure you make some you time and enjoy a good show please see it for yourself instead of looking into these negative reviews everyone has a right to their opinion but make the decision yourself
to each their own accurate or not enjoyed every bit of it though there could have been improvements in some of the acting but overall was ok i also wondered about the choices of people of color set in that time but understood it to be in a typical world with all things being equal regéjean page is a brilliant actor
"it might seem odd to focus on the costumes when there is so much else odd about this but think of the exquisite costumes and jewellery used in the most recent emma and then compare it with this
at that time muslin was the fabric of choice for young women in white or very pale colours in this all the colours are garish and the clothes for the older women are frankly unbelievable ive never seen so much bosom heavingeveryone is wearing huge mounts of tacky jewellery which is all over the place in terms of period some looks like s woolworths  but there is simply too much all the timethen morning calls im pretty sure that young men did not call round to see a named young lady the morning after the ball in the way they are queuing up to do here i dont often feel pity for the actors but i did here  it was so cringemakingthe people putting this together have seen a few film adaptations of jane austen but understood nothing about the period or the manners"
let us speak of a simple truth if you are ok with people waltzing to shawn mendes  years before he was born ok with women in their mids playing young teenagers ok with huge anachronistic liabilities yet are not ok with a black duke a black queen an interracial relationship a black man with a white servant then you are a racist whether you like it or not you are a racist grow up
this web series is the best web series of  in terms of love story please release season  quickly
ive been reading some bad reviews so i wanted to say that this show did exactly what it was supposed to do it entertained the goal wasnt to be historically accurate the goal was to be an intriguing tv show and thats exactly what it was when i started watching it i stayed up till  in the morning to get as far as i could complex characters regency era be it a more exciting version and great sex scenes what more could you ask for
i dont normally like british shows but i kept hearing such good things about bridgerton so i tried it it took me a couple tries to get through the first episode but i became completely immersed somewhere during the second episode i love itpay no mind to the hateful miseryfilled  star palookas you know who they are
"its a simple sunday love story where you sit on your couch on a lazy sunny sunday after a big lunch and a wonderful desert waiting for sleep to take you away yet you wont fall asleep because as fictive as it might be this story is filled with so much colour you desperatly want to see more at least this is how i feel
and omg sorry for the spoilers but that love scene i am old fashioned and that scene truly fascinated me
it makes me want to crave more for the respect a man should have towards a woman and the kindness a woman should have towards a man both should cherrish each other i hope one day i will find this kind of passionate love and respect"
i like dramas set in a past time period i like dramas set in the same period as bridgerton however after watching the first episode of this series i cant bear to watch more its not just that the characters are out of place or that its so unlike reality it might as well be set in another world its also really poorly written the characters are flat and unbelievable
this show is absolutely amazing i cant stop watching definitely recommend love all the characters we really need a season 
i am shocked on the bad reviews of this show i loved all the characters and found it very entertaining the costumes were beautiful the dialogue was witty the chemistry was palpitating at times i admit my favorites scenes were with daphne and lord simon i felt their connection and left me wanting more every episode i actually plan on rewatching the series again its worth a watch
very good work this is a very good overall a good movie and we all like it
absolutely loved it the show is romantic and emotional with excellent acting from the two leads they are passionate and the chemistry is palpable
wonderful series with very nice casting and special plot
i dont have much to say except i stopped watching it after  episodes i tried to like it but there was nothing to like
ill be honest i dont watch many shonda rimes shows i find them to be not quite my taste for reasons you all probably dont care to knowbut this this is just soapy enough to be fun and substantive enough to keep me interested this is witty dialogue that relies onwitty dialogue this is strong female leads that rely on other strong females to keep them going this is what i always hoped a rimes show would beand since its based in a series of books where each heroine gets her day we hopefully dont have to worry about too much soapy stuff interrupting our prior heroines happily ever after in the seasons to comethis is a fictionalized england where where you can suspend disbelief and reveal in the world created for your enjoyment
bridgerton season  was not my favourite but i was very impressed with season  bridgerton season  shifts focus from daphne to the man of the house anthony i really appreciate that the writers chose to focus on anthony because he becomes much more likeable once he takes centre stage we understand why he acts the way he does regarding love most of it is rooted in his grief from losing his father  years before anthony was forced to become a man much too earlywe are introduced to kate sharma a spinster who also lets her familial duties come before her own wishes like anthony she is stubborn loyal and familyoriented queen charlotte names kates sister edwina the social seasons diamond to which anthony takes an interest in courting throughout the season and in his own words it is clear anthony does not wish to marry for love because of his family first mindset however that may just be an excuse to mask the true real reason behind his refusal to marry for love  his fear of losskate and anthonys longing gazes and moments alone display their immense chemistry i do not think ive seen such an abundance of onscreen chemistry between two characters other than kate and anthony when the two are alone the orchestral crescendo matches the rising sexual tension between them the serious and dramatic tension is accompanied by cute and funny moments such as the pallmall scene a good romance will have both additionally there is chemistry between the entire cast you can tell they like one another which really shows that chemistry transports on and off the screen this season is a slow burn which seems quite a different approach from the previous season the slow buildup of enemies to lovers archetype while a cliche is entertaining yetsometimes period dramas can get boring but i did not need to fastforward any scenes in season  cinematography acting and screenplay are  i am heavily anticipating season  which will place colin and penelopes romance to the forefront
waiting all season to see julie andrews unmasked as the lady whistledown and then its little pen i do love a wow did not see that coming moment all though hard to follow it is not an easy watch the cast each delivered good performance for the s but stand out performances for me came from elrose antony and lady delacorte nice touch with making modern music instrumental to suit the era all in all not a show i will watch twice but im glad i did
the series is impeccable from the costumes photography soundtrack the representativeness of the cast was wonderful and the cast itself is incredible  its just all perfect a series to cry have fun learn from the characters and their evolution i cant wait for the second season it was all amazing 
"if you enjoyed downton abbey you will probably enjoy this series situated in england although different eras the two series take us back in time to the grandiosity and richesse of s with the gowns accessories balls waltz and palaces
i would give the series some time since the first episode can be confusing with the large number of characters names and big families yet once you get acquainted to the characters you will fall in love with their acting
despite being only  episodes the characters evolve tremendously the acting of the  main characters daphne and simon is beautiful the two characters embark on a very complicated journey yet evolve and grow together obviously it was clear where their friendship was heading starting with a cold ruse into a beautiful friendship to only move into passionate love lies and true and complete love at the end the progress of the couple felt almost impossible at times and i think thats what made it convincing
the secondary characters such as eloise colin lady danbury anthony marina and penelope add a great touch to bringing variety to the series eloise is revolting while all ladies her age should think about marriage she doesnt anthony is involved in a forbidden love marina is pregnant from a true love yet is not married yet and so on these characters bring us the reality underneath the perfection painted through those balls and gowns we are and will always be humans with lust desires but also shame and mistakes
i love the mothers character who despite making mistakes was juggling her  children alone as a single parent trying to balance between the duties and roles that the era demanded from her but also having her own values and principles believing in true love
finally lady whisteldowns character added a true twist to the whole plot a little like gossip girl where aside from all the action and intrigues a main mistery remained all along although i should admit it was easy to unveil her true identity"
"first off i couldnt care less about the diverse cast the actors who played simon and lady danbury were great but the personalities for anthony violet and so many others were justwrong i wasnt a fan of the addition of mr featherington or the boxing they included
and why has no one mentioned the absurdity of the royalty plot why was that needed ruined the whole thing for me
the fleshing out of the other siblings was nice but it also left a lot of blank spots in daphnes development"
new look to an old story i love it such a treatmusic score is a bonus
in coming across this show i binged the whole first season one episode after the other and im excited for more it kept me intrigued the actors do a great job and i feel like this show does a great job in giving a glimpse into a historical period of time well filmed great storyline i highly recommend
the plot and the story was very entertaining and utterly romantic i was hooked from the get go and there wasnt one dull episode the entire season the diverse cast was so refreshing and i absolutely loved it binge it or watch it at leisure its worth your time for sure im definitely rewatching it over again
julia quinns bridgerton on netflix is a great adaptation of her work moving any book to the screen the writers have to select certain aspect of the storyline to keep it moving so always remember the books are the books the series is the series and never the two shall meet casting was done spot on
"i loved this show people need to understand that it is not a history lesson its fun and romantic as it should be and i loved they took the opportunity to showcase amazing poc talent playing parts that had not been usually portrayed by them
shonda is a genius"
if it is going to cram modern concepts in a victorian fiction why do a half assed job of it and not go all the way
i thoroughly enjoyed that the chemistry between the leads was incredible i just dont understand the negative reviews about lack of historical accuracy  its fiction enjoy it for what it is a tale of love conquering all
"this series astonished me in every way and left me inspired happy and full of emotions
first of all to the diversity of the cast because it is the first very obvious observation it is not accurate of course we all know that but seeing another and better version of our history is a powerful thing one that i felt and loved
about the plot it is basically gossip girl playing in the th century but with much less teenie drama and much more real emotions the way the picture the sexuality of the characters is truly new to me and as much as a fresh breath of air as the diverse casting
i havent read the books and i know it can be hard for screen adaptions to live up to ones expectations i cant comment on that but without having read the books this ist a truly new strange and inspiring series with a great love story i would recommend to all my friends"
loved this series the two leads did not have a lot of chemistry but their sex scenes were hot hot hot there is a lot of eye candy well done to the casting department
what a amazing story of siblings trying to find love and romance while trying to avoid big scandleslying and cheating a great romantic drama show with a great cast characters and costume design the music how they use todays music for the show is amazing definitely worth watchingtimothy treakle
i fell in love with this family in the books and now on tv even thought they changed a lot of things the essence of the books are right there and i thank the creators alot for bringing my imagination to life
surely this should be listed as fantasy i have only seen trailers for this show and fond them to be absurd after checking out the creator of the show i was not surprised and resolved to avoid watching at all cost
took a little for the show to really get going but you cant help but get wrapped up in it very good
love the casts love the costumes love everything❤
if you used to like romantic movies but in this day and age stopped caring for abuse sexism and harassment considered romantic in our old classics well this is for you feels good without a false note there was almost never a moment when i thought this is stupid or argh come on they just need to communicate better arent these moments the worstanyway beautiful actors performances direction and costumes fun all along
yeah its dumb but its also fun and so well produced not boring trash great actors and writing and i hate this type of content and i love this highly recommend some great up and comic talent
if downton abbey and gossip girl had a baby in you would get bridgerton being a fan of both of those previous shows this one dazzles first off the setting sets costumes and color scheme look great i think the cast did a great job i really felt immersed in the show and time period i especially felt immersed into the bridgerton family the first episode made a big splash for medefinitely curious to see what comes next
it would have had a nice edge to it with its quirks and over the top colours and characters so within this whirlwind of frivolities schemes and balls yet another cumbersome story about motherhoodfatherhood and the inevitability of it all it was not only preposterous but completely out of place
dont watch this if you want a real feel period piece the amount of angry reviews on here because its inaccurate are astounding i personally loved the fact that the queen was a black woman and that the love interest was an incredibly gorgeous black manits a fun and gossipy version of the elite in england where all cultures are mixed together to create a spicy and daft world definitely had a gossip girl feel with the gossip rag but with julie andrews narrating it makes it charming rather than viciousits beautifully bright and colourful with fun quirky characters and an enjoyable love storyi binged the  episodes in one go im not sure what could be added to it with a season  but nonetheless ill watch when it comes outits an easy show to watch and overall enjoyable if you dont take it seriously
no i haven´t read any of the bridgerton books but i have understood that there are some differencies between this tv series and the books i really want to read the books because i think that bridgerton is a charming well written enjoyable amazing and nice tv series usually the famous saying goes so far so good but i must repeat the title of my review so far so greatpeople might have some huge issues with this tv series modern interpretation but i´m perfectly fine with that the first and second season of bridgerton have made a lasting impression on me i have rewatched some scenes circa  times yes you read that correctly lady whistledown is my profile picture on my netflix account why because i am a huge fan of writing i have also watched and liked the netflix afterparty  bridgertondo i have a favorite character in this tv series maybe lady whistledown daphne or kate but honestly i must say that i like many of the characters in bridgertoni´m looking forward to the third season very much i hope that it will be as great as the first two seasons fingers crossed
ok reading the reviews frustrated me many people think this is a jane austen take like sandition bridgerton is a book series by julia quinn if you want to be super technical jane austens novels were mostly before the regency period she lived from  the regency period was that being said romance novels including regency are not grand literary works like austen they arent trying to be it is a guilty pleasure genre with various degrees of steaminess they are fairly predictable and fun reads though period pieces historical accuracy isnt the  priority its fiction that being said queen charlotte was very likely mixed racespeaking of race this is a shondaland production  shonda rhimes is known for the inclusiveness theres no way she would ignore queen charlottes lineage and i think she used that as an opening to add in the inclusiveness not to mention viewers like seeing themselves represented by adding a diverse class more people are willing to watch same goes for the color schemes especially the featheringtonsif youve read the books youll still love it my mom read them before watching it  after watching it ive read most of julia quinns bibliography we both loved it yes some liberties have been taken such as adding characters  side stories and making daphne a blonde incomparable but it doesnt take away from the stories i think the added side stories actually make us more invested in the characters building up the excitement for the next seasonsall in all dont take the series too seriously just sit back swoon giggle and enjoy
woww this season  has been so so hot anthony is super hot in this season lol kate abs him ughhhhh ive rewound parts because they are so intense
to those who complain about the diversity of actors not representing history well you have had a whiite jesus and biblical heros on your screens so you cant really complain about a few black royals
its like a bad played parody not enjoyed not recommend
a good netflix show the reviews on here are being way too harsh it was a solid show
"a lot of people misjudged the series saying that it does not meet the real period in fact the showrunners did not want that i really enjoyed watching this series the plot is so interesting and the costumes and decors are just amazing
you can easily get attached to the characters and their story beautiful series totally worth to watch"
bridgerton is a fun simple and romantic series the costumes and the atmosphere are very nice it takes you away from your daily life and ensures you a chilled and lovely evening
so good so far not understanding the bad reviews truly enjoyable
appalling casting simon is cast with someone vastly more attractive than he is in the book the entire bridgerton family is cast by someone whom has never seen attractive white people daphne is portrayed by the most insipid girl i have ever seen why im wailing the bridgerton brothers are attractive at all there are dozens of more attractive men you could have chosen lady danbury rules
unbelievable plots poorly written dialogue a great disappointment
i could not tear my eyes away and im usually on my phone watching a show but this grabbed my full attention and wouldnt let go if you want the same old period drama then there are millions out there for you bridgerton is the period drama for us who are excluded from those other stories we deserve a happy ending too i cant wait for season 
i love julia quinn love stories usually the book is awesome but the movie or series it is made into is not up to the mark but bridgeton is exceptionally well made couldnt stop after watching the first episode cant wait for the next season guys be quick
pure escapism a fresh adaptation from a young ladies perspective the sets costumes and hair were breath taking bravo i loved it penelope stole the show for me
i actually liked it a little too much nudity but still cant wait for the next season nice to have something with a different genre than cops or medical shows refreshing in mt opinion probably will watch it again while waiting for season 
very distracting and interesting if youre looking for escapism tv this is the show and boom series for you
what plot after the first couple of episodes you realize there is absolutely no plot the actors do well with what theyve been given unfortunately the story is absent this is quite a bore
shondarhimes netflixfinally a film which reflects the fact black people also existed in the royal courts of england  through out europe athough bridgerton is fiction a good start to research document begin telling real history on film
i absolutely love this series  the characters the dialogue the characters have with each other the diversity of the whole cast  i love all of it my girls wanted me to watch this so i binged it it hooked me immediately ive always been drawn to time period dramas and bridgerton does not disappoint cant wait to see s i am so excited s and s were riveting and as accurate as possible for that time period the costume attire was completely stunning its irrelevant that in that time period as the diversity the cast the show depicts was non existenti find it well done love 
i wasnt a huge fan of season  maybe it was daphnes baby bangs or the cringey sex scenes i watched the full season but my reaction raged from meh to ugh but season  has me hooked the chemistry between anthony bridgerton and kate sharma absolutely sizzles the music continues to amaze you oughta know now im in
why all of you take it so seriously it is a really enjoyable series with nice production and beautiful act from main characters if you are not into that kind of series about th century or fairytales dont add it to your list bridgerton surely doesnt worth  out of  rating i see in reviews
absolutely enjoy the entire show completely binge watch the entire season in one night was highly enjoyable hope there is another season
looks like the world just wants to hate anglosaxons not even allowed to be an ethnicity anymore im sick and tired of it there is nothing redeemable about color washing white history out of spite
loved it all very bingeworthy every period piece does not have to be jane austin the acting was excellent costumes were beautiful and scenery exquisite i thoroughly enjoyed it
bridgerton is beautiful and romantic the aristocracy truly believes they are civilized while treating women like chattel however bridgerton has given women the autonomy to create their own destinies unlike other historical dramas that portrays women as weak and needyi love lady danbury is gorgeous bold and does not take no for an answer shes the pencil that connects all the dotsthe men are fickle and lost and in need of attention a nice change from the typical period romance dramascheers
its awesome its bingeworthy loved the chemistry between daphne and the duke
"amazing already watched it twice 
really well done i recommend to everyone who wants to dream a bit"
fun and entertaining fantasy drama perfect diversion if you are a romance fan
"i liked the cast but the drama is hard to understand why the creators brought queen charlotte to the scene why marina and all the fuss with the opera singer
it was confusing it made the plot slow and heavy
simon is so freaking hot but not even him could save this disaster
eloise was so annoying and the costumes this is a nonsense
a terrible waste of time i hope they do a better job for the second season julia quinn and her characters deserve better
and the music horrible attempt"
before i start id like to say i love period piece moviesshows i was skeptical since i dont like gossip girl or other basic teen girl shows but bridgerton is differentafter  min i was hooked the chemistry between regejean page and phoebe dynevor is undeniable the casting costumes set editing and acting are phenomenal just give it a try
produced by shonda rimes comes bridgerton a tv show set in the regencyera england seen through the eyes of the powerful bridgerton family the show focuses on daphne bridgerton and her journey to finding herself a suitor during the social season she quickly becomes the favoured bell of the ball but unfortunately the suitors arent quite to her liking meanwhile the duke of hastings has returned to london to settle the affairs of his late father he doesnt have any interest in finding himself a wife but fate has other ideaswhile the social season commences a new gossip paper is discovered called lady whistledown giving everyone daily updates on whos pursuing who and any other scandal that presents itself throughout the season think gossip girl but with a daily newspaper instead of text messages and instead of kristen bell for a voiceover you get julie andrews which is pretty awesomeone of my favourite parts of bridgerton is the balls like fullon dancing balls not only are all the locations phenomenal and extremely gorgeous the costumes are incredible and the music is often contemporary music played by an entire orchestra some of the songs that play throughout the series include thank you next by ariana grande bad guy by billie eilish and wildest dreams by taylor swift this one was my personal favouritethe costumes on this show is absolutely stunning and not going to lie it made a corset look very appealing the guys on this are extremely good looking and i havent seen any man pull off a top hat and mixed patterns like the men on this show doall in all this show is incredible and as this is based on a book series with the first season representing the first book there could be up to  seasons i can imagine there will be plenty of nominations for the upcoming awards season and all the actors and actresses are well deservedthis is a show that i wouldnt recommend watching with your parents though there are plenty of steamy scenes that dont leave much to the imagination and as someone who did watch this with her parents i definitely will be watching the second season on my own unlike gossip girl you dont have to wait until the entire series is over for the mystery youll be sure to discover who lady whistledown is by the end of the season i highly recommend everyone watches this especially if you are already a fan of shonda rhimes
i loved this a movie to watch and just feel good watch it enjoy it  take time out to live in a fantasy world where love wins
bridgerton is not without its flaws the plot is weak at times but in general the acting is good and it is a pleasant entertainment for those looking for a soapy romance story the highlight is the intensity of the romances that peaks in season  i must saythe increasing romantic and sexual tension between the leads is amazing and i hadnt seen something like this for a very long time there are scenes that made me weak in the knees for this alone the series is worth the watch if you are craving for romance and a handsome smitten hero to fantasize withregarding other aspects i didnt care much about the historical inaccuracies i take this as a fantasy story so im ok with everything
you can see that the jewelry is fake the costumes have nothing to do with reality but if you dont take it seriously as i believe it is intend to be it is quite delightful
political correct bsits like remaking the shaka zulu series only this time they casted white actors for shaka and his tribetotally unbelievable
ive just binged this in  days between children high on sweets and presents definitely not for someone who likes history to be just so but otherwise its wonderful colourful intriguing and full of life all the characters are played amazingly well and just like a good book you feel fully submerged in their world i was sad when it ended and i will definitely be watching it again
there are so many poor reviews for this show and i dont know if they are honest or harsh either way i dont agree at least not completely bridgerton is certainly not the best show but it was filled with enough drama scandal and comedy to keep me gripped throughout the series the costumes and set were absolutely beautiful
ive read all the books and am thrilled with this telecom series season  cant arrive fast enough
netflix brings to our tv an amazing love story wrote and created by shonda rhimes which shares the story of a family the bridgerton seeking to find love in london s high society it is temporarily located in the xix century so the costumes settings and also the music will create a special atmosphere that will keep you captivated short note the music from the series are songs that you can listen to everyday on spotify or even radiostations adapted to the xix century vibes amazingbut what is more interesting about this are the love stories that this show deliversin season  penelope falls for a duke the most charming duke you will ever see as she discovers the perks of being a woman in lovein season  the love triangle between anthony kate and edwina will keep you entertain and some kathony scenes will make you weak trust me chemistry is assuredif you are a fan of love storys mixed with royal issues and a lot of gossip this is your thing for surep s cant wait for s
this show is beautiful and anyone who thinks otherwise is wrong
if this is not considered culture appropriation then its because of double standardsbridgerton is a silly masquerade where anyone can dress in a costume and claim they are whomever they want without merita worthless even damaging lesson for people anywhere but especially in the west where entitlement is considered a virtue nowadaysi gave up watching it after a couple of episodes it spews nonsense for which ive had my fill from news and social media
if your are looking for a historical drama based on true events and facts  this is not for youthis was so much fun to watch the characters settings the wardrobe colours movement the storytelling so imaginative but can assure this fantasy this fiction changed my dayswe are now in the middle of a pandemic  with restrictions and bad news arriving everyday  do we really want to watch something linear and sad and heartbreakingwe want to watch something that jumpstarts our imagination that makes us giggle laugh and blushhavent read the book and expect it to be as catching as the series or more because thats the way it should be
season one was absolutely phenomenal season two boringit dragged and the music was mediocre compared to season one simone ashley needs more acting school i did not feel the chemistry between her and the lead role anthony i cannot connect with season two and i really tried however it just was not memorable
the most watched and loved series ever gets low reviews get a grip 
i iike pen and colin the tough eloise the spice of the other featherington sisters the warm hearted bridgerton mother and the entertaining ceolike featheringtonthe beginning seems fine  they are on a good way i liked that pen wanted to have her own glowup shine so a good hearted man would pay her the respect she deserveson the other hand colin seems to be a good one in the previous seasons selfsacrificing and open for a good woman which did not worked as planned and even he talked bad about pen behind her back because he thought it does not matter in front of the dirtbagguys who have their own simple minds and it was the easiest way to get them quiet  not nice but possibly everyone knows this he seemed to be a good friend and no playboyso the last season ended with colins wish to see the world and the new season starts with his return from the trip there would have been many possibilties how to use this for the new season  most likely he found out what matters in life found someone one his trip or returned and found someone in one of the first episodes which build up parellel to pens maturingthat was not the case even it seems for audiance at first that he believe in what he says and wanted to teach her what he would appreciaten from a woman it came out he did not follow his own words and just did this for pen because he is not busy with his own non existing search for a good wife and because he has gilt feelings that pen heard what he said like  no no you understand me wrong i will show youmoreover the audiance get the feeling at the first episodes that colin search for a woman and does not find the right one at the events that fit to him they all act like silly groupies in front of a handsome guyin fact he liked the attention just as much as he liked to vistit woman who charge per hour  it is a kind of frustrating that this is the development he achieved at his trip  not cosmopolitan not someone who matured  came out better and want that share after his return just someone who learnd that you can satisfy your needs everythere one the worldthe thing with lord debling  as others stated out you may think he is really interested in pen and has only eyes for her  even other women try her best it seemed that there would be a showdown between colin and the lord as the seasons reach the middle  but no moreover without the last scene between pen and the lord on the stairs wild guess  which was one of the scenes who was reshot or added due to fact that the creator noticed that the season is way to dark and unsatisfying  the official reason why the season did not air earlier without this scene you as viewer could think in reality he did not care about her feelings at all and if you think further he just saw in her the safe choice the woman who would be overjoyed to find someond who would marry her the woman who would not do any attempt to find someone else when he is away for years the woman who is not know for to be courted in the past anyway and that even more look like if pen was not his first choice but leave a woman like cressida for three years alone at home could be a kind of risky  so he saw pen as the best horse for him and put his attention on herthere were a lot of changes in the ton of the season in the fourth episode  like netflix ordet a season with  episodes devided in two party we have to hurry up make progress and throw a boneas also mentioned from other  there are sidestories that i did not need in a  pisode season which took an eternity to air and has to last for an eternity until the next seasoni hope in part  is way more essence as shown in the trailer is it really that big deal that pen is lady w is it really necessary that eloise threaten pen i mean it was not that big deal for eloise in the first episodes of the season and she did not tell anyone even she was resentful when she saw how the people treat pen no matter how hard she tries  eloise felt kind of sorry for peneloise was the one who talked about the project colin has with pen  which spreaded more and longer when everything pen wrote  with was not nice but not without reason as eloise should have notice during several events at the end eloise should know that pen has a pure heart and an her longtime friend search for real love something what is not common in portrayed society of the show just look at her friend cressida for me this problem is probably made up to much in the next episideslast guess for a good twist who did not read the book  is the baby challange part in the book at all or just made up for show  pen become pregnant really soon and is the daughter who give birth to a boy at the end there were also a lot that i like in part  of season  until now  maybe more for part 
i liked everything in the series the actors were wonderful the music the conversations the story itself and everything else were wonderful i really enjoyed watching it i totally recommended from my point of view waiting for season 
nothing redeeming about this show why even call it bridgerton when it completely butchers the story beyond recognition
a moment to visit back in the era of renaissance or say regency era of london when there is way to select brides and grooms shame and family honour is top priority king and queen have powers and nations were united over the wedding brighton is one such family they are in search of perfect groom and eldest one fall in love after several accidents with biggest catch of the place and what started as a fake alliance turn into love but due to prince friedrich insecurities things fall apart and daphne get pregnant was the issue bridgertons  cousins were all set for marriage but will they find love and things got problematic when one of the cousins whose love is at war died and she have to find another groom to support her child and she went with his brother and most of them enjoyed there time  finally all ends well and few find there love and mystery remain unsolved is mrswhistledown but lets see what season  got for us
ive tried watching other period pieces because they have high ratings but found them boring after considering this one for a few days i decided to try it the brightness of it the colors costumes hair everything is absolutely stunning thats what drew me in my thoughts very shortly into it were that it was an early th century gossip girl i would say im sure the writers directors producers intended it to be that way as someone whos not read the books never even heard of them until the show came out i dont have that to compare it to but i enjoyed the show very much i dont care for the gratuitous sex as most others have stated either but thats one of the things usually found in this genre so it didnt throw me off so much i loved the show  it was gripping at times and visually beautiful
s gossip girl with infusions of modern day references im enjoying this series very much on episode also to the one reviewer that was upset that black men and women are in this show as dukes queens princes etc you are the prime example of subconscious racism very disappointing
excellent period drama with wonderdully written intertwined stories watched it all in  days as it was utterly captivating
"this is a truly magnificent show that many people just do not understandlet me explain this show is not historically accurate and was never meant to be it is a light hearted look at the autocracy of its time in order to appreciate it you have to set aside the thoughts of black rich people and indians who would not perhaps have existed in this time and set it in an alternate universe once you do that it becomes 
a marvellous light hearted look at the gentry of the early s it has many interweaving stories of love lust and betrayal in amazing settings and fabulous costumes slip your historical mind into natural and go with the flow and i guarantee by episode  you will be hooked"
 for a production so centered around the two leads having one of them signed on for only the premier season makes little sense  a sweeping love story ending as it is beginning  then to have that actor mismatched to such a degree with the other principal of the story makes even less sense  dynevor  page never really look like they belong together  their intimate scenes show that  they never truly produce the sparks that are supposed to be flying between them now for season two hes gone after all the setups for a continuation of the future between them  netflix has an increasingpenchantreputation for producing shows with glitches  now one that must begin anew with a replacement not expected by viewers producer shonda rhimes said of the series our goal is every season having a couple viewers are obsessed with and you can believe were not going to see more of their story next season because were telling a completely different love story every season  there are eight bridgerton siblings and as far as im concerned there are eight bridgerton seasons  thats a lot to ask of viewers well see how that all works out
the plot of the tv show is amazing is a typical shondaland show
"i loved
its perfect i love the book and loved this series
i need a new season"
im definitely not a romantic movie or tv show viewer but i really liked this show binged it in  days and a month later im rewatching it again season 
lovely series binge watched from pm to am saturday i havent read the book so i couldnt compare love eloise and daphne love the unmasking didnt expect it decent acting cant wait for season 
i absolutely loved this series for me it was an amazing ride of love challenges and desire the character development and writing was phenomenal the scenery and music were absolutely divine and fun such a unique and titillating period drama i will watch it several times over and if there is a second season to come i will excitedly anticipate it
"oh deari normally love period dramas but this one is so contaminated with political correctness and virtue signalling that its nauseating yes you know what i am talking about  the abundance of nonwhite characters in senior roles partaking in ballroom dances and being lords and ladies totally madeup and totally false the lefties are trying to rewrite history and pretend that there were black lords in england in the s theyre brainwashing youngsters into thinking that oh look weve always been a multicultural country
the defenders may claim oh but this is not meant to be totally accurate portrayal of the era but imagine if in a period drama set around the s if rather than horses and carriages the victorian characters drove cars everywhere  would you not lose total credibility for the show same principle here with the diversity oh and before anyone uses the r word on me  im nonwhitethe only thing missing in this joke of a drama series was a blm fist symbol in one of the classical paintings on the wall"
the best thing about this show is all the snowflakes that have gotten their noses out of joint because its not the cookie cutter grey and drab regency that they are used to and those who are purists of the novels and expecting the same story beat for beat as in the books and i say that as a reader first and tv watcher way behind thatseason  despite the many problems i had with it was much more enjoyable for me but i still liked season  also unfortunately i found the two leads in season  whilst certainly delivering solid performances to me were much more akin to live theatrical performances where everything needs to be exaggerated rather than small screen ones
this mini series is meant to be entertainingnot jane austin or historical accurate its that simplethose who are bashing it are trying to complicate this fact where not talking about a historical period piece here these are based on modern romance novelsnothing more
i am shocked and saddened to hear the other reviews because it has africans in it art is subjective and movies and tv and be created in anyway if you cant get past the diversity im sorry but you are the problem of the rest of us not moving forward in society this is the stuff prince harry and megan markle are trying to change this show has great harmony great acting the cinematography and music selection very good costumes are exquisite as well this piece really shows at the end of the day being diverse we still have gender issues in society but it also shows that we can progress i find this show charming makes you yearn for more and give at shot please give it a shot wiht out ill judgement
 this started out refreshing with some interesting characters including the queen the aunt who looked after the main male lead character and the gossip but they can only do so much i will say that having a mix of races at all levels of society just felt right and it also shows how jarring it is to see people of colour relegated to tokens or maidsbutlers in other shows these are all made up stories anyways show some imagination since any glorification of historical periods is bs and none of the historical shows in the past have shown reality for  percent of the human racethe intelligent sister was more interesting than the main female lead daphne who was dull in all ways and the main male lead was barely interesting the first half of the first season was far better than the second half some negatives include those two main characters who were flat and uninteresting i thought for sure it was going to turn out that he was illegitimate anyways since the housekeeper mentioned that his mother had trouble getting pregnant and needed some good strong seed implying that it was the asshole father duke senior who was barren one can always hope that this far more interesting plot twist will come to fruitionas well the pregnancy and fall from grace for the visiting cousin was ho hum also the opera singer romance also boring sorry was she supposed to be a version of the hooker with a heart of gold maybe if more was actually shown as to how she became an opera singer what that life was like instead of just professional love interest to men of meansthis show would have done well to hire the writers from jane the virgin if the plot is to be constrained then the character development must run the show and insipid leading ladies and men isnt it i gave this an  but only is worth a bit over  and that bit is for the elements i mention at the topfinal note was this written by the current young generation who thinks they have invented sex and want to show off their new toy every generation goes through that the irony in this case of a historical fiction is delicious
completely hooked from the first episode cant wait for season two
an absolute caricature of th century regency britain clearly written and produced by americans the bbc does it much better ironically i say this as an american but a strong anglophile the gratuitous sex of season one was luckily waned down in season two season two at least has an interesting dramatic arc though i still struggle to find the true dramatic benefit in revealing lady whistledown at the end of season  what i dont understand is how these actual british actors somehow sound like they are putting on an accent i watched this out of curiosity and clearly word of mouth interest
i loved how they managed to get the essence of the characters from the books to the screen i loved the scenery and the clothes as well as all the excitement as everything is presented i loved it so much and im looking forward to the nd season
fiquei impressionada com a produção dessa série já era apaixonada pelos livros e a série superou todas as minhas expectativas
"this show is a breath of fresh air feast to the eyes royal colourful entertaining
enjoyed the show so much made me buy the book after having read it prefer the show to the book
i rate this show  because  is perfect and bridgerton is not but it certainly does not deserve "
unlike most of the other reviews my husband and i both liked it we are looking forward to season 
talented brilliant incredible amazing showstopping spectacular never the same totally unique
i started the first episode and found it boring and stupid one of my friends said that i didnt give it enough time i watched more episodes it never got past stupid most of the characters are portrayed as idiots
"i adored this show
it was something different and something for the senses
if youre into period romances this is definitely for you
if thats not quite your style maybe give it a go anyway
go in with no expectations and just enjoy it for what it is
dont listen to the haters  listen to the fact it was one of the most streamed tv shows of december  for good reasonim off to buy the books"
the thing i love about this show are the characters and the modern music adapted into the elizabethan era
after looking at all the negative reviews here i almost decided not to watch it but for those of you wondering whether to watch it or not i say go for it and decide for yourself the chemistry between the main leads is sizzling which is always fun to watch even the entire cast is thoroughly enjoyable
i dont typically watch these types of series however it was my wifes turn to pick our next series to watch so i tagged along we were both very engaged and impressed by this series i dont know why so many people are giving it such bad reviews i thought it was very well made and entertaining
"i dont understand all the bad reviews i thought it was an excellent story predicable and not historically accurate but both the books and movies are complete fictional so i dont think historically accuracy is really that important even though its in the late s i love all the diversity theres a feminist character and gay characters as well as a good mix of racial representation its a bit like pride and prejudice
there are characters you love to hate and characters youll just love this is a series ill probably watch more than once it was very enjoyable"
" im not interesting in idle gossip and backstabbing and this is hour upon hour of it
 the sex scenes are so cheesy and overdone and sometimes take up the entire episode
i tried to watch but episode  was enough
 this show doesnt empower women it shows them mostly as nothing but liars but also attacking one another gossiping about one another using sex as revenge  doesnt seem very empowering or "
i havent read the books so came to this series without any expectations and i loved it the story line is good it is visually beautiful and the cast are great it has everything you want for a weekend watch i binged this in a day and now im sad its finished
it was a good show enjoyable to watch and definitely binge worthy but they changed a lot of the story from the book to make it more drama filled and scandalous and they took out  very endearing parts from season   boom  that i loved and  huge changes from season   book 
wow just finished the last episode to the first half of season  all i can say is wow at first i was bored of this season but then i came to realize it was all a build up of my favorite love match in the bridgerton series yet these two are everything and more i felt so bad for penelope when she was being criticized and mocked but this actually makes her realize her worth and sets her up to fully embrace love colin has glowed up so much and so has penelope i love her character evolution and can we talk about that carriage scene i may or may not have rewatched it three times already
i absolutely love this adaptation ive read the books and shonda has brought the characters to brilliant life the music costumes and sets are breathtaking i cant stop watching can not wait for season 
now im watching season  the newest one from the episode  until now im in love with everything that is connected to this amazing stories of all characters i also recommend to watch bridgerton serial about queen even more lovely story what here is not to love actors costumes historical places and traditions are perfectly fine present to audience so i can compare this to anee with an a its just kind of serials you can watch it over and over again and never being bored im not giving spoiler but if you like this part of our history its perfect for you i hope they will film at least tree seasons more
british aristocrats being played by africans and idians completely ridiculous if that wasnt ridiculous enough the plot and writing are worthy of a youtube amateur soap opera and the acting is hammy because netflix makes these aberrations skip this garbage
"awesome show hope season  comes out soon
you will love for sure it has twists and turns"
like a huge fan of the books i have to say that im delighted with the show its absolutely charming modern beautiful so happy with the result so happy about de whole crew actors actresses directors and specially shondaland team thank you all for this show
honestly to say i fell in love with this series the characters the dialogue the dress the location the chemistry absolutely divine
"binge watched this show and enjoyed watching it binge watched agin for the next few days
to me it was jane austen gossip girl to all the boys mixed in one and it was highly entertaining
the dresses and the dance and settings were a treat to the eyes
eagerly waiting for season "
bridgerton is not jane austen a docudrama based on real life or even downton abbey bridgerton is a highly fictionalized soapy romance series set in the regency period it has a good storyline beautiful costumes gorgeous sets with lots of eye candy it is historically accurate absolutely not its a fun watch and enjoyable
the only emotion i managed to have watching this was laughing i laughed a lot if that wasnt enough the plot the writing are equally terrible and the costumes are artificial that look like they were made for a childrens theater it could be set in the present time which would be just as silly but not as fanciful as that j a is turning over in her grave
you will not find the same sweeping safe romance of jane austen here instead youll find a show that is based on books that are quite steamy and full of wit humor and a good amount of sass i loved s so i decided to listen to all of the books on audio ive since fallen in love with the family even though the show deviates from the books a lot the general story is the same and the differences especially in s have only kept me on my toes its worth the watch light hearted romance lovers will rejoice
clearly this isnt shakespeare it is supposed to be light people but its an incrediblely enjoyable very well made beautiful looking fantastically soundtracked series its fresh its fun its often got surprising balls just what the world needs now delicious escapism cant wait for the next series
im not hyper critical expecting the show to be historically accurate in time period representation i like that the casting is diverse and they dont feel the need to make a big deal out of it i thought the show was a great escape during a rainy weekend if you like period pieces give it a try and ignore the people who nitpick every little thing
this was a wonderful multiepisode series i realize that some things in this movie may be farfetched considering the period setting of thes but the characters are believable and enlightening if you like love stories where each episode is so wonderful that it leaves you wanting to bingewatch the next episodes all day then this movie is for you
at first glance i didnt expect bridgerton to be so well directed it was beyond my expectations the choice of casting is excellent phoebe and regé are great together and they really delivers authenticity and realness in their characters as simon and daphné their british accents empowers the scenes for me it was their entrance leading them to their first dance as they form an attachment which really catches my breath away the decor the fireworks were mesmerizingly epic the music and the soundtrack really comes along very smoothly and captivating even the script was astonishingly wellwritten and you completely felt emerged into the show at the end of the day its a really beautiful love story based on true feelings conversations and the way phoebe and regé portrays their characters for one minute you might feel like they skip their characters to reveal their true own personalities and it really enjoyable and unique to see you learn whats really important in life the little things details that really matters in season  anthony and kate were perfect for each other i truly much enjoyed watching them playing their characters so well they bring so much love humour great conversations and it was a real flow of state from start to finish their first meet up on horses were great going to the balls dancing the wedding scene to the end bouquet finale was just fantastic the music definitely plays along well also eloise and theo were lovely i think the upcoming seasons are going to be marvelous too
nope just nopemore of the same nonsense can we just fast forward till movies and shows become good and more importantly accurate again
this series allows for loopholes and every one is taken having said that the romance is unique in the scheme of things when one reads a book its not imagined that the characters are not pictured in the mind of the reader then again one can be so engrossed in the words its imagined shonda shocked youd never know the romance is old fashioned from the synopsis and if you havent seen it but only heard about it one cant know a music artist from  years ago but can know the regency era apparently this work of pure fiction in the era of oxymorons such as historical fiction is nothing more than a marriage where the partners dont stiff each other it swept general audiences and spawned a unicorn an unofficial grammy winning musical apart from it the synopsis and some echoers make today feel like  you maaaaaaad is what needs to be said to accurate historians who dont even know what peoples favorite musical artists were  years ago without tricky google they think there was only one race back then and only one race could achieve and be rich
i loveeedddd the storyline i cant even believe there r so many bad reviews on this  there is so much diversity within the cast too and they explained that this show wasnt an actual reflection of the time obviously the people who left bad comments on this clearly didnt read the description on the show or saw that it is a romance  they call it cringeworthy well then why bother watching it  it was rlly great  see for yourself  acting was also amazing recommend
but we do love it dont we bridgerton is without question the most absurd illustration of th century aristocracy ever portrayed on any screen large or small its painful to even think this was actually any kind of realityhowever there are several redemptive qualities that come to point one of which is the colorblind casting the other is lady whistledown whatever would we do without her she is the one character who reminds us of just how ridiculous it all is eloquently expressing her opinions that can even help us formulate our own well i dont need much help thereone thing of particular interest here is the fact that in the vast majority of mainstream gay themed movies and such lead characters are portrayed by straight actors in this case however its refreshing to see that a lead male hetero character who has great difficulty keeping it in his pants is actually portrayed by an out gay actor hows that for a little gossip take that lady whistledown sorry if that ruined anyones fantasy the integrity of the character is well maintained through superb writing and a gifted actor eventually it will be ok in hollywood to avow ones sexuality without destroying their careeroverall this one must be taken with a grain of salt lest we fall into the shallowness that is this production if youre going to engage in this tale of historical nothingness take it for what it is
this is a must see series aaaa writing directing and acting  i absolutely love the music and the story line i recommend it to all my friends and co workers the way they have mixed the music of today with the lifestyles of the past is brilliant it was beautifully done and you can watch this show without having to try and understand their language and speech we talk about it so much i hope they make more episodes
"this show really captured the fun of julia quinns work while i did find the diversity of the cast to be a bit blatant the story moves right along as of their skin color didnt matter i really liked the portrayal of simon once i knew the writers werent adding in some background of african roots just the actors skin color no big deal
costuming and sets are gorgeous its a bit fantastical rather than perfectly historical but it balances nicely between the two in a nearly believable but still fun way"
this show is a prime example of money thrown towards sets elaborate costumes many wigs most ugly etc at the expense of poor acting writing and story lines the music tries to be hip but lacksseason  was bad mainly due to lead femaleboringseason  is worse mainly due to lead maleover actingall of the acting tends to be very bad along with the directionsaturated colors are pretty but thats about it
i have read all of the books and the movie was beyond my wildest expectations loved the actors costumes storyline etc i cant wait for the next season
is a pretty good series i recommend it to be watched as a couple with your girlfriend girlfriend wife it is very well made and the atmosphere of that period is wow i recommend with confidence especially for couples
if you were a fan of the books you will love it if you have never read the books you will also love it if you like period pieces specifically regency they did well in choosing both actors sets and costumes good grief the actor they chose for the duke is seriously swoon worthy i love that they have julie andrews narrating as mrs whistledown also if you like to binge watch this is an easy show to do so with cant wait for the second season
i just love how the families and the details has comed through the chemistry between simon and daphne is just stunning also i liked the other characters i see lot of people misliking this series but i found it entertaining and easy to watch give it a try 
ee i heard of moon knight but never really knew the hold story but then i saw the first episode on disney plus and i gotta say im excited for what comes next oscar issac really takes us on this journey playing like a cary grant like style
terrible casting and even worse acting the whole thing does a fun book series a disservice i am disappointed
tale as old as time  those of us who enjoy romance novels have often read this or that interpretation of one and the same love story young man troubled by his demons comes to terms with his life with himself through his growing love for a girl he is rich and handsomeshe is beautiful and pure bridgertons plot is predictable happy end  mandatorywhat is unexpected is the absolutely mindblowing on screen chemistry between the main characters it was pure joy to watch the development of their romantic relationship in this reimagining of th century british high society  racially diverse so colourfully dressed not at all historically accurate who cares i do not get why so many people are upset that bridgerton failed to portray regency era with historical precision that was not the plan all along what makes this series so unique is that it allowed creators imagination run wild and free except for the love story  the pulse of the show the centre of bridgerton universe simon and daphne will pull you in and leave you with a happydreamy smile on your face at the end of the final episodereinforcing the idealised notion of romance it is total escapism and a hard blow to gray reality it is great entertainment

if the likes of outlander and poldark are the classic music of period dramas bridgerton is the pop music of period dramas its catchy it has a good beat and you can dance to it but it lacks substance layers and depth i thoroughly enjoyed it as a oneday binge but it cant touch the nuances depth and historical accuracy of other tv dramas set in theth and th centuries
"in short book lovers should go in with an openmind and jane austen lovers go in not expecting an historically accurate regency romance but a fun modern twistif youre expecting this show to be a bbc pride and prejudice or emma series you will be sorely disappointed
bridgerton mixes modern society with a regency backdrop with its diverse cast and orchestra versions of modern music it has a very fresh and modern feel while still having most of what you love about a good regency romance
being an avid reader of julia quinns novels i tried to watch this with an open mind knowing booktotv adaptations will not be  true to their original stories though i thought the narration and overlyposh characters of the first episode of bridgerton to be a bit overthetop the show does settle into a nice rhythm come episode two and onward
the showrunners and writers really do capture what was and is so special about the bridgerton novels stories and characters while bringing in bits of other bridgerton books and new characters and sidestories to fill out the show
i really enjoyed this series and seeing the characters and i know and love being brought to the small screen very entertaining sexy and fast paced all with beautifully designed costumes and sets i binged all  episodes on christmas day and i am ready to watch it again i for one cant wait until season "
it takes a clever team indeed to take a historical romance book series which focuses on the happilyeverafter one one couple per novel and make it into an ensemble cast with a strong throughnarrative yes many changes were made when comparing to the source material yes the costumes and events arent meticuously periodaccurate but the unique effervescence of julia quinns bridgerton family books is what has been brought to the screen the decision to offer a femalefocused femalegaze perspective to regency life sex selfactualization and identity in love is what we needed from this new historical romance series the spirit and overall arc of the characters is what van dusen and shondaland have given us and that is what matters most
absolute hogwash never never never in georgian society yes its fiction but even fiction has to have some resemblance to reality especially when its historical fiction if not why didnt they put michelle pfeifer as one of the slaves in roots if they did it would have be utter nonsense and absurd as one reviewer wrote why not add every other race and not only black people but i disagree with this reviewer that the inclusion of black actors was due to the producers being americans ive watched movies made by british that also suffer from what the reviewer calls diversity i think this movie is a reflection of how diseased our world is now when an historical fiction has to strain so much for fact that it becomes a travesty of history pity
"i loved it
the heroine got a little annoying at times but the lead hero was very swoon worthy loved eloise and her search the clothes the multi culturalism maybe racists you can try pretending its an alter universe where people are just better in general its awesomely mushy but not too silly and the sex scenes are hot but man are there a lot especially when you are watching it with family and youre like maybe i should watch this alone in my bedroom with the lights out
anyway i loved it and highly recommend it and i am not a typical hallmark holiday romance watcher i like a bit of grit and intrigue
i gave it  stars to counteract the racists and their many extrafake accounts id probably give it about an "
incredible actors wonderful production great script and does not deserve the racist attacks he has been suffering because it is a series of fictícia history and not historical based on real or historical facts but yes fiction accept that there will be black protagonists yes and all are great actors
"i will admit i have not read the books but thats okay because this isnt a book review as for the television series it was captivating the sets wardrobes etc were precise and obviously created with precision the actors all hit their mark and played their roles exceptionally well just like any story you learn to love and hate a few of the charactersthe series was exciting to watch and i wanted more as soon as i finished the first episode i wanted more love more lies more sex more betrayalall of itfor those reviewers upset about poc playing queens dukes and highclass individuals get over yourselvesits fiction for goodness sake this isnt some biography or documentary
yes the story does include historical elements however most viewers comprehend that what we are watching was soley meant for entertainment and entertained we were"
love bridgeton they worked so good i think i think that it was amazing to see a curvy woman like penelope and colin i love their different love stories i i am looking forward to penelope and colin story and all the other too
this show is what daydreams are made of what young lady wouldnt want a handsome duke to escourt her around town and dance with her at all the parties what woman ive never had this day dream the gowns are exquisite i even found the mens clothing to be beautiful the storyline is an ageold tale the music modern in a classical sense i can watch this show over  over if you like a fairytale watch bridgerton
its not that hard to condense regency literature into a tv series or film after all it has been done many times before to high standardsi seem to recall shonda rhimes saying that content should mirror the world we live in but regency britain is the past and i cant imagine why she didnt just deal with the world we live in right now never mind that the world we live in is vastly homogeneous depending on where you arewhat bothers me most about bridgerton is the lack of regard for historical accuracy even beyond the casting the dreadful clash of colours in the costume and production design made me think id tuned into britains got talent by mistake do they care that most of the pigments needed for those garish colours were not available in the early th century i think we all know the answer to thatthis series displays some of the worst hair makeup and costume ive ever seen on any britishmade production this is what happens when some people behind the camera especially the standby crews are untrained but in the case of bridgerton i suspect this is actually intentionalif you want to watch period brit series with black or ethnic characters that make historical sense id recommend taboo or even the millfor those who just love the artistry of amazing costume and make up teams s pride and prejudice mike leighs peterloo or mr turner emma thompsons sense and sensibility and howards end are perfect in fact youd be safe with anything shot before 
this was never my genre but wow did this show change that i put this on almost nightly just to fall asleep to the soundtrack was surprising and so good its in my playlist now i have now been buying the books because i am addicted to it now i highly recommend this show even if its not normally your type of show to watch just give it a chance you might get hooked too
i love it all cant wait for next seasoni researched it over again cant get enough
this might just be the best series of  season  is needed
"i havent seen downtown abbey and im not fan of jane austen dont know why people constantly prefer to compare things this is love story for itselfs
good actors amazing scenography i really enjoyed it well done"
loved the series better than the books the characters are faithful to the spirit and i loved every momenti hope netflix does right by shondaland and keeps this running for all the books
i gave it a go watched the entirety of season   who are people kidding with the actual draw for this poor one directional mess there are actual dedicated sites that offer unsimulated acts for those unaware for me this was a mess dressed up as a  shades story
"not trying to be an historical drama a fun and delightful romp
loved it
ignore the bad reviews not aiming to be anything historical"
this show is so much fun the shows story is so addictive it really reminds me of gossip girl the scandals and the salacious gossip are really entertaining and exciting the music is just fantastic i loved the string versions of some of this years chart toppers including ariana grande and shawn mendes we all need something to brighten up this bleak year this has everything you could possible want sex scandal love and beautiful people
this show is off the charts good funny romantic and gives you all the feels
"not usually one for period dramas but watched because of the hype
really enjoyed it was funny great story and fabulous acting by all
will get the books to read now"
love the diversity cast in this series enjoy it  cant wait for season  in the future
i am speechless season  is dreadful the script is an insult to human intelligence acting is poor during some of the most passionate scenes we bursted into laughter the situation was so unbelievably forced and comic we almost thought we were watching a parody
this is one of the best shows on netflix of anywhere for that matter it has it all i watched the whole season in two days it was so good i couldnt wait to see what was next its juicy good fun cant wait for season two those who gave it a negative review obviously didnt bother to even watch it is netflixs most watched show of all time scandal lust love secrets and diversity together it makes a wonderful show
pretty good representation of book series so far dumb to cast a gregory to be younger than hyacinth i hope there are more episodes soon 🐝
even though i am an enormous regency fan i had never heard of these books let alone read them ill admit that the first episode was a bit disconcerting since i didnt know anything about the show before seeing a short trailer but i soon realized the genius of the casting the actors are well chosen and play their characters with believability  isnt that all we really need i laughed i cried i fell in love with daphne and simon and especially with lady danbury im going to see if i can download the rest of the books and ill probably be up late tonight reading more about my new favorite people and seeing them all in my minds eye i cannot wait for season 
"dont listen to all of these negative nancies on here i dont remember this series ever being billed as piece of historical record or claiming to be an adaptation of any work of jane austen this is a beautifully and imaginatively written series that perhaps challenges the viewer to imagine how the issues of race and propriety may have actually played out in high society from the perspective of those who it affected rather than from the perspective of those who didnt want to admit it was a real issue
judging this series as the original work of art that it is it is nothing less than brilliant it is wonderfully romantic with indelible characters that are drawn together in a truly imaginative series that is addictive i really hope they are able to continue the series"
after watching the trailer i was curious about this show and didnt have anything to watch so i put on episode  watched whole season within  hours it has a lot of charm would say if you liked gossip girl and you also like jane austin stories you are going to absolutely love this
this series is so silly it follows the books so loosely that you wonder why its named as such the cast is terrible the acting is mediocre and the costumes are something worthy of a childrens theater they added to the background of something historical and british just to disguise the mediocrity that this series is
diversity satire humor and wonderful costuming in this production focusing on a series of matches many not of any interest but none offensive or overdonethe central appeal is the glitter of the videography and the chemistry of the two leadsboth off the charteasy to rewatch or have on in the background as well as a popcorn muncher for a weekend by the fire
i feel like most of the negative review are by people who are used to downtown abbey or are looking for any reason to hate the series i personally have never been able to get into historical but this show captivated me its refreshing and does drag a little in the last few episodes but at the same time its refreshing to not have a and they lived happily ever after once theres a wedding and show actual hardships the series does a good job to integrate other characters in a way that makes you giddy to see their romance play out in later seasons
a good portrait more of the same and this one is good at the end of the day is a previctorian gossip girl
season  was much better than season  in my opinion it had more substance romance more thrillin season  you can truly get a sense of the strong connection between daphne and simon of true love you notice the looks they give each other their relationship is gradually built through small gestures and meaningful conversations and it doesnt take forever to reach its peakseason  insists way too much on the negative sides between anthony and kate creating unnecessary drama explores too much the family subject for kate and when they only share a few passionate interactions suddendly theyre madly in love with each other it lacks the build up and feeling of authenticity from the first seasonkates stubbornness and devotion to her sister gets to the point that is truly annoyingwouldve liked to have seen more positive interactions between her and anthony and not so much time wasted with that farse of a wedding between him and edwinathe whole thing with lady whistledown also gets to be annoying so much fuss around the subject and it is weird that just like eloise we rarely see the side of penelope that likes to gossip and is interested in the affairs of othersalso the complete absence of simon in season  was awkwardi truly loved how complex and full of substance season  was season  was good but dragging and unnecessarily dramatic
no its not historically accurate but we all knew that going into watching it that doesnt mean you cant enjoy it for the super fun show it is im a european history major and it didnt bother me at all i found it refreshing so not sure why people are miffed its not true to history its an alternate reality which is why its so creative and something new for a changeits sexy light hearted and tons of fun so just enjoy the premise and indulge in the what ifs of it all nothing wrong with a reimagined period drama series where people of colour could have been a duke or a queen not the one shining the silver
billed as being a modern classic this fails to hit the mark in every way the two main foundations of any production are the script and the acting  both were appallingly bad but not the good form of bad to make it at least laughable the sets and the costumes were good to look at especially some of the locations but the acting was so bad its as if the actors and ive seen better ones in a infant school play had decided to vandalize every scene they were in to ruin the location if you like watching total rubbish poorly written and dreadfully acted this is for you if not dont waste your time
"i always wonder why a series or movie has either  or  ratings or    or  unless there is a group of people with some irrational bent for or against a show this is fiction so people getting bent out of shape about color blind casting seems irrational
there is a huge cast with many stories to tell of romance and intrigue this actually is my favorite shondaland show im bingeing the first season and look forward to future seasons the series has also encouraged me to buy the books by julia quinn"
bridgerton is pure escapism fun romantically erotic eye candytake it for what it is and enjoy the talent of all those involved  the first thing to note is that this series stems from the amazing success of julia quinn books lots of them  so successful in fact that she wrote prequels and spinoffs  the books are funnyromantic full of irony and steamy light entertainment with no claim to sofistication  bridgerton is not and doesnt want to be an a accurate historical period drama the stories differ from the books a bit and shonda rhimes unique take of them transports us in an alternative  one where people of color had the chance to be included in the highest ranks of british nobility see queen charlottebridgerton doesnt aim to be historically accurate or to mimick jane eyre the only thing that is accurately described are the limitations and the difficulties of being a woman in  societyshonda rhimes has done a magnificent job on every level the visual the music the costumes the cast really she is a tv mastermind she depicted a vaguely historical fantasy rich in colours romance desire and used today musical hits played by musical quartets in classical arrangement as soundtrack the use of color is stunning and is complimentary to the storytelling defining the characters and in both seasons the sory is aderhent enough to the books to not lose its heartclearly nobody is perfect and were all entitled in personal favourites and tastes i for example would have much preferred the character of kate in season  being as funny and ironic and lighthearted as she was in the original book both the script and the actress played kate too headstrong and dry cancelling the humour trait you can find in jq book making her a little too arrogant and at times completely unpleasant not a fan of simone ashley acting to be honesti find bridgerton a great entertainment show with no pretense to the oscars but visually stunning and fun to watch
the plot the locations the characters and all the factors are rendered to perfection the backgrounds of the characters their experiences etc are explained to the audience in a very nice and descriptive way as someone who has read all of his books i fell in love with the whole season and i cant wait for the other seasons to come out with the same perfection
the bridgertons is a series worth a second watchim looking forward to the second season it was very interesting to watch the plot as a whole despite the fact that almost every character has its own storylinethe very beginning may seem a little boring but its worth to endure in order to continue to simply burn with interest in subsequent eventsthe series is filmed very beautifully the cast is simply amazing smooth transitions the atmosphere of the aristocracy and much more make the picture bright and interesting but the main thing is just an amazing plot
this is the best serial hit ive ever seen  pseudohistorical melodrama the plot is very intriguing and unexpected people are so tired of the debilitating madness in the world that the bridgertons with their uncomplicated extremely banal and simple problems wandering from century to century turned out to be the perfect escapist start to the new the public is also ready to enthusiastically follow the ups and downs of love because romantic prose with its elementary hyperemotional sensuality will never cease to excite peoples minds in general this is a very cute insanely exciting and colorful project which even ends according to all the canons of a soap opera here they get married reconcile and forgive i am inspired and advise everyone to watch 
i couldnt even finish the st episode if youre a fan of the regency historical romance genre you may be as disappointed as i was maybe not to each his own for me it was a complete bomb didnt like any of the characters right out the gate maybe the problem is ms quinn writes such fiere funny characters its hard to accept what i perceive as bad casting choices maybe it would be very enjoyable to those not attached to the bridgerton books
all the haters made me have to write this is not an historically accurate drama its not supposed to be nor were the black characters substituted because of color blind casting they were purposefully added to create an alternate history one where a king married a person of color and changed the culture the fact that people dont get this is kind of inexcusable since its right in the dialogue of one episode yet having different races is not a big part of the story  it is clearly a cultural statement if youve watched other rimes shows like scandal and how to get away with murder you know that interracial couples are a common theme except this time the main characters are flipped with a white female i totally understand how that might make people unsettled with our american history of lynching black men for raping white womenthis is not about the books  the stories are based on the books and the sexual aspects are very much from the books but this version adds the aspects of race to make it edgier and better i havent read the books nor do i plan on reading them because i think what has been done here is taking source material and doing something different with it that source is based on a period when the romance novel was born the era of jane austen and yes this does pay homage to that genre very well especially since austen clearly read original feminist material by mary wollstonecraft and used them for basis in her work along with etiquette for women and the various ways they were expected to live and behave and there is considerable commentary here about those topics but regency novels are no jane austen and shouldnt be equated as suchthere are definitely references to disney such as the two simple sisters one of them who sings terribly in one scene like drizella in cinderella this is also obviously paying homage and perhaps satirizing the genre but it also feels familiar in a way that lets your guard down and pulls you into the story more but this isnt a rip off in any way just as using the source material isnt because art always imitates other art the important aspects are in where they differ and distinguishing those differences is where the statements arelook nobody is saying that bridgerton is a masterpiece like pride  prejudice much like her other shows its full of scandal and sex but ultimately is fun its entertaining as hell truly i could not stop watching this after a couple episodes and i cant wait for more seasons for people that dont understand that the casting is purposeful i suggest you do more reading on american history and civil rights its clear to me that normalization of mixed society is a main theme and i love itbesides that this is just cheap dirty fun and i liked that too 
its absolutely wonderful it actually brings a delightful joy to many viewers amazing cast the continuation of this show is a must too many people love it 
i really love most of the changes they did from the what was on the book love the cast they did wonderful they truly played their characters well i had fun watching this series and do recommend to watch it
i started to watch this series once it revealed on netflix but i also rejected it once i finished only ep i thought it all rubbish and id never see it again however i found out it earned quite a bit of profit and attention from audiences then i think perhaps i should watch rest of the show and the result i am not dissapointed at all probably you should give it another try if you made your conclusion about the show before you finish but no pressure its all your decision
just watch and enjoy a nice story with a fantastic decor
history without any semblance of historical accuracy is propaganda if you have not cancelled your netflix account yet you should or this will never stop
"this show is unique and brilliant  a must see 
your welcome "
god bless you for the diversity of actors the music the costumesi couldnt never imagine so much talent in one serie look them shine on the screen what a wonderful idea to leave racism god bless you for that they are just marvelouswhat a wonderful serie i really enjoy itthank you all
jeez peoplewhats up with all the bad reviews if you read romance novels you would know that this was based on a collection of books by julia quinn its meant to be racy its meant to be fun and definitely not for the kids so quit complaining watch the eight episodes and enjoy
this tv show goes very well with a beer or wine at the end of the day and it actually helps to forget about all problems around us you can relax and enjoy watching pretty women and handsome men in lovely clothing listening to their charming conversations in good english great cast and talented script writers in first season in my opinion second season is a bit lower in quality but still moderately enjoyable to watch looking forward to season 
the whole drama is very wonderful and eyecatching in addition to the background costumes and music the plot line of the story is also very bright not dragging mud and water and the passion play of the male and female protagonists is really enjoyable after watching super reluctant so i watched it a second time  definitely the most memorable play ive seen so far
i dont think theyve yet invented a word that can hope to capture the utter badness of this mess i went with horrendous but that only hints at the level of awfulness achieved in this eyesore and earsore while i salute the reviewers who have attempted to document the various badnesses of this show thats like trying to count the number of grains of sand on a beachit will be a cold day in that famous hot place before i watch another netflix original series
"addictingsexycolorfuland filled with scandal and drama i cant thing of a better way to close out 
i really like the actors they choose"
this show never claimed it was going to be historically accurate in fact the entire point is to be diverse fun and to add a new updated spin to this genre some of the people who are complaining are actually upset about the diversity theyre like oh no what are black people doing on the screen if diversity bothers you watch something else apart from the lowkey racist there are actually others who are genuinely upset this is not some exact replica of the book sorry to tell you its not meant to be and if thats your expectation you may want to watch something else the show changes some things and thats kind of the point if you go into this with an open mind and a fun attitude youre going to love it the show does not take itself seriously which is actually what i appreciate about it its not really heavy its actually lightweight and very amusing i love the spin on using current songs but putting a classic twist on them that was so edgy and i appreciate things like that the show takes liberties it does things how it wants to not how its supposed to its the good kind of cheesy and we loved every minute of it the show is actually blowing up a lot of people are really into it i went into it understanding exactly what the show is trying to do so i didnt take it seriously and i was able to have a really good time dont let the low key racist or the traditional people fool you this is a really cool show and so many people have fun with it
"bridgerton
i am presenting the series that i love the most  bridgerton i think it is the best series for people who like alternate history period drama  the story is about the bridgerton family which is based in england  daphne the beautiful daughter of bridgerton deputs on london marrige market  while simon the duke of hastings returns in town  and the most important one is lady whistledown  the mysterious lady of the newspaper which keeps everyone informed of the scandals of the society  thats what i like the most about this series  theres a lot of mystery and conspiracies that keeps you excited this series is not exactly like every other british period drama about the fancy talk  but its also filled with romancesocietydrama rumour mystery that grabs your attention since the begging  the acting is perfectly achieved and everything is well constructed  i fell in love at first sight one of my favourite so far and i totally recommend it  "
the season  announcement of this show has been tickling my bum not even going to lie this show is great and the song adaptations are even greater it feels so nice fun fresh and sometimes even oddly hot to hear songs from our century being adapted into the one they are in i would make a painting about this show if i could but i honestly dont want to its  degress outside today and i can feel myself melting into my work chair as i type this they give me nothing to do here so i have lots of free time to write especially very entertaining and easy pieces such as this one anyways lady whistlewhatever needs to stop in her steps and remember that she is in fact a ginger and she should feel lucky that she is not getting stoned every day because of it im hoping she ends up with her one and only lover crush best friend whatever youd like to call it
absolutely loved it binge watched until the end and i cant wait for seasons to come
so bad its actually unintentionally funny in parts a lightweight foam of nonsense stripping any real substance from what could be a marvellous series to leave behind a bodiceripping suitably woke yarn for the moron generation perfect for bored housewives desperate for their next fix of  shadestwilightetc to ease the numbness anyone with any semblance of standards from their content should avoid
the series is fastpaced witty fun sexy and everything from the actors to the production are extremely pleasing episodes that have no boring parts that you just want to skip over like other series a modern touch on regency romance that viewers around the world can enjoy
great escape for any girl watching to dive into romance a bit cheesy but the sexiest period drama i have seen plus second season also funny story telling absolutely amazing in nowadays lust and lost soul perversion it is nice to watch slow build up and poetic love dialogues super hot love scenes too was a surprise gay can pull off such believable straight man second season better than first one so lets see if quality continues in later seasons but i will definitely come back to watch as it is truly great mix of passion class build up fun esthetics story teller voice was the things that kept me watching on first season so well deserved award indeed
"i love the show its innovative and interesting my favorite so far i could use a little less of the extra long love scenes the story is good enough i like the hot and steamy but i dont need to know every single detail im more of a classic romanticism vs todays bang bang thank u mam i like sensual sexy love scenes without crudeness otherwise it feels like porn beautiful
couplings"
a gorgeouslooking drama based on julia quinns bestselling romance novels this adaptation is fresh exciting and a whole lot of fun think austen and gossip girl mixed with downton the crown and perhaps a dash of outlander a splendid regency romp with a spectacular cast that are perfect as their characters sit back relax and enjoy some good fun absolutely cannot wait for season 
cant believe all of the bad ratings on netflix this is one of the best shows on netflix right now it has scandal romance and an intertwined story line i like how they incorporated races together even though it wasnt the real regency period after all this is fiction right since the covid i have watched an i surmountable amount of tv and this is one of best shows i only gave it one stars as i think the main characters  simon and daphne need a little more emotion in the acting and it is a bit pg rated for the story
this is more stupid than the stupidest stupid or even stupider
all those spice mmmmmmmmmmm honestly im fed up well thanks simons your typical alpha male whose ego beyond the reach he can f himself ion care he can be gone ss not for him but yall hear me ouuttt tho
enjoyed every episode and really hope for more seasons to come
"the show is incredible
we need to talk about it black people was not rich in the history because of the white people so please stop and accept that this should be the right"
really liked to watch this serie its like gossip girl in another period
this was the best period romantic show that ive ever seen the storyline was great
this is an absolute mess nothing really happens characters are plain onedimensional and not memorablethere is no message no ploti just dot see the point in making this seriesthe main character is only concerned to get married and have babies she even makes a horrible thing to get pregnant later in the story and we are suppossed to like her and understand her there is literally nothing interesting about herthe male lead does not want any of the things she does but it seems that it is romantic for the writers to coerce him into it he also lacks personalityhorrible i gave  only because the main actor is gorgeous
bridgertonseason was so good i loved it and have watched it an unhealthy amount of times 🤣 kanthony have next level chemistry on and off the screen its like d chemistry it just jumps off the screen at youi also loved all of the anthonybridgerton monologues to katesharma i loved that it was so different to the first one in the sense that it wasnt only about displaying physical intimacy it was also about highlighting psychological intimacy the meeting of the minds throught the heart just loved iti keep saying this season is far better because its brilliant tv all round all the elements watching anthonys growth interwoven with kates and all those beautiful conversations with his mum daphne and benedict and how that translates into all his monologues to kate even things like the tulips he brings to her in episode  links to season  when his mum talks about tulips to him its all just brilliant
amazing romantic and cant wait for the next season
so much hate on this show but i must say i tastefully enjoyed it binged the entire season in one week and i for one look forward to the next the fairytale romance had me hooked i eagerly await more
this show is so entertaining it takes you into a bright world i am a huge jane austen fan and this was the perfect show to watch if you enjoy her writing
it starts out as a fantastic and beautifully done period drama with amazing costumes sets and hairstyles and then the sex starts and it keeps going and going and going it gets to a point that you just fast forward them to get to the next part of the storyline its a great up and down love story but the constant makeup sex is boring and loses its point otherwise a good production
i reluctently sat through  episodes of this series with my wife bewildered at what i was watching ill be the first to admit i am not a romantic drama fan but i dont mind watching a good show i can loose myself in along side my wife so i am open to them however this one is off track in soo many ways i dont watch tv to be reminded of political correctness or what some people wish history looked liked that is exactly why i avoid the news now its coming in through netflix there may as well of been flying pigs and aliens included in this show as in my view it is history science fiction and a scary preset yet again to open doors that allow history to be confused and glossed over in a polical correct way be mindful of what you support
hard to get into but had some interesting plots kind of forced
ill start saying that i dont considera myself a romance lover however i enjoy a good romance when its well told and with extraordinary performancesshonda rhimes really knows how to do tv in season  they did a great job with world building cause they addition of black royals rebuilds this world as is in season  they make it clear that the structure is a new story new characters but the same quality and season  i feel like it cements the theme of it all which is a lot of romance classy sex scene and gossipit is very enjoyable even if its not usually your cup or tea its very entertaining point blank
i love the fact you have a new phone numbers and your number will help us get it out and you have a lot to choose to and your family will have a lot to choose to and you can share it to me and you can share your thoughts with you or you have to do something for your family or family and you have a lot to choose from you to and you are so blessed and your life will always have to do so we will always have a lot of things you can do to and your life will be so blessed and your family will be happy and blessed you are your life will always be happy with us all you do for your family love love and
when i watched this show i was amazed by how beautiful the cast and design of it was the scenery was to die for and the outfits were also amazing they also made sure to focus on each and every character showing how that character is going through something although the main focus is of the  love interest they do not fail at giving others screen time as well people can hate on this show for having black people and other people of color playing queens dukes etc but honestly does that really matter at the end of the day this show was not meant for a complete historical accurate portrayal it was meant to show the love stories of the amazing bridgerton family from the moment i started the show i was hooked every episode had me at the edge my seat waiting for something new the shock when i found out who lady whistledown was the whole time was insane this is a show a  recommend for others to watch
i liked it a lot i was first shocked that they put people of color as elite members of society but later on i kinda love the idea that if only that is really the case then it would be a very lovely scene where love knows no race hope they put asians too even as traders i liked how the story goes deeper when pride and hate is portrayed as something shallow and the duke gave in that love weighs more than hate and how the couple came to understanding as an asian from a conservative family i can really relate with the scenes as to how my mom cared for me and how my dad used to arrange my future and how me and my siblings were as well as how the head maid of the house treated me and how i adjusted to the new community and the people of the household when i got married i also loved the blind item like a classic gossip girl it adds fuel to the fire and made the show more interesting the show may have eliminated painful realities in history but the realities of life is there how some couples are to each other how many people portray a happy life but in reality they are not how people appear rich perfect and happy in social media but in reality they are problematic and empty as well as how you would lose people and how they would talk about you once they find out your deepest darkest secret the staring game is one of the best also i like how they just look at each other and communicate it is just so romantic
this is unbelievably ridiculous of a historical tv show if you want to call it historic because its completely wrongit is completely inaccurate the folks of african ancestry held high positions and had respect during this time let alone in england when they were not treated nicelycmonwhen i see a show that takes place sometime in the past i want to see accuracy that includes fashion hairstyles mannerisms music etc etc i dont want to see a tv series that would appease certain demographicsit is not worth my time at least i gave it a try until they correct it i will no longer watch
i live the storyline and how it keeps you wanting more
the way they mock the old ways but still keep it informing and educative amazes me such a good and fun serie to watch
like anything thats rarely done or having even a glint of controversy there will be outspoken critics and reactionaries chomping at the bit to have anyone hear their pleas and protestations its not until theyve become distracted by something else that a gem like bridgerton can be genuinely regarded on its artistic merit overall despite the negative reviews here im glad to see the general audience is far more discerningbridgerton is a delight simply put its as easy as sunday morning ive found myself binging this series more often than im willing to admit okay ill admit it ive watched through every episode at least x in under a month and i hardly ever rewatch series im not obsessed youre obsessed anyway it has beautiful sets amazing production value incredible music that i absolutely love along with an amazing cast and characters all tied wonderfully together by a beautiful script and directing i could almost describe it like an  hour long movie given its pacing theres always something interesting happening meant to drive this quite remarkable and unforgettable love story forward including truly gorgeous cinematography that brings this fresh reimagining of the regency era to life if youve an open mind give bridgerton a chance and you will not be disappointed unless having fun disappoints you i cant wait for the next season to arrive
i havent read bridgerton i have read bujolds vorkosigans saga we are all having a wonderful time matching characters from books written in the s to s with a bookscreenplay airing now tee hee
i am loving this new series already i have laughed and cried over the course of the episodes so far aired seeing characters grow in their understanding of themselves and those around them is inspiring added to the amazing sets wonderful dancing and beautiful arrangements of well know songs it is just a pleasure to watch one of the few shows that actually makes me put down my device so i can give it my full attention i havent read the source books and fully intend to wait until the show concludes so that i can fully enjoy it usually i would go off and read the books to get all the details that arent able to make it into a tv series but this one i want to watch first so i can just enjoy the beauty of it
you know its actually somewhat entertaining watching these lowiqers who think theyre actors however it quickly becomes tiresome the wokness and antieuropean fake history displayed in this lowiq series rewarded netflix a cancelled subscription good luck netflix d
i really dont get the negative reviews on here this show is absolutely spectacular the cast i cant even choose a favourite as each is so unique and captivating the acting the dialogue the clothes the breath taking moments you get the point  bingable delight
what age does this series be about what age does this series be about
only the smart ones understand it brilliant work
bridgerton it looks like the usual period romance drama but it breathes fresh life and more passion than is usually comfortable to watch with your parents along with the expected romance theres a mystery that keeps you needing to keep watching one season is not enough recommended for anyone that loves a good period drama but will enjoy modern elements
"i loved everything about this series beautiful story cast picturisation background songs choreography love and romance and most importantly how it ended after long time i watched a story wiyh happy ending
ut is a must watch"
i was not expecting much from this latest austeninspired series but it was almost impossible to watch the whole plot was lost and muddled to start with in the frequent versaillesstyle sex scenes it became clear very quickly that this was not even an outing to show faithful costume design but rather a bodiceripper eroticromance novel put on screen the terrible acting was irrelevant since none of the characters or plot were worth paying attention to anyway
"firstly you have to understand that bridgerton is not historically accurate but a regency fantasy series
yes it has its flaws and controversy but at its core its an engaging guiltypleasure love story that has all the cliched tropes like titanic or ps i love you
it also has in my opinion the best shot sex scene on screen ever wedding night
its traditional and sometimes prude but the dialogue is snappy and sometimes outright romantic the music is both fun and melancholic when it needs to be have some fun for crying out loud"
nearly stopped watching after the first episode but stuck with it so glad i did superb acting especially from the two main leads the raunchy scenes between them were so tastefully done their chemistry sizzled colourful lovely scenery including parts of bath which i loved seeing as i live nearby im really sad ive finished watching it
from its wholesomelooking trailers i had expected this to be like downton abbey or an adaptation of a jane austen novel i almost dropped this when it got more raunchy than expected but as i had done with game of thrones i ignored the unpleasant parts so i could continue following the storyoverall its highly entertaining aside from the colorful and wholesomelooking cast the costumes houses grounds and parks are lovely the bridgertons with their capable and affectionate mother violet ruth gemmell are a delightful lot composed of eight children with names starting from a to h they really love their mother and each other a testament to the great love between their parents before their father passed awayviolets best friend lady danbury adjoa andoh is a rich and influential widow who is a friend of the eccentric queen charlotte golda rosheuvel the wife of king george iiithe bridgertons neighbors the featheringtons are quirky and rather silly except for the youngest sensible penelope nicola coughlan a close friend of the rebellious feminist eloise bridgerton claudia jessie pudgy penelope has a crush on colin bridgerton luke newtonthe series showcases london societys obsession with finding suitable marriage partners during the regency era it depicts how fathers or guardians take their responsibility to find suitable husbands for their daughters or sisters seriously the excitement and fuss that go with preparing for a ball especially during a girls presentation to the queen the importance of a girls reputation the long lines of suitors after a successful night at the ball how being declared the diamond of the season by the queen can drastically improve a girls marriage prospects and a marriage proposal being the soughtafter culmination of a london seasonevery now and then a mysterious writer named lady whistledown voiced by julie andrews would print scandal sheets that report on juicy tidbits about members of the ton eloise with penelopes help sets out to uncover her identity even collaborating with queen charlotte one timeseason  mostly deals with the bridgetons first sister and fourth sibling daphne phoebe dynevor who catches the eye of the duke of hastings simon basset regéjean page during her first seasonseason  is mostly about viscount anthony bridgerton jonathan bailey and kate sharma simone ashleyi found both seasons delightful once ive decided to ignore the raunchy parts instead of fuming over how the producers were sullying sweet love stories with unnecessarily dirty scenes
this was a well put together series the storyline was so so good and all the characters role was amazing i just love the scandal in it was so good and this is something you can watch more than once
this is light and breezy making it great entertainment after a long day
this is one of the worst shows i have ever forced myself to watch not surprised at all that its a shondaland production as this wreaks of all the mistakes she has made in her previously entertaining shows this entire series is mostly about the concept of knowingly marrying someone who doesnt want kids and forcing them into submission every relationship in this show is shallow and incredibly predictable even the ending surprise was not a surprise at all i tried my best to get through this and find something enjoyable but overall i can confidently say that i hate this show and its absolutely awful please do yourself a favor and just read the books as it seems everyone who has read them can admit they are far better than this pile of trash
i watch the full series of bridgeton and i would have to say that i found it very refreshing its something new something different they did not stick to old past use on how society should look or act but using a little bit of a modern touch to a renaissance time i found it fun interesting in risktaking in a good way a lot of people are still stuck in their old believes that when they see the high society they cant understand or believe that minorities could play these particular characters which is really sad especially with this time i would love for my children to see stories that have more diverse backgrounds to show them more than just slaves and servants but people of high society contributed to this world so in conclusion i found that this was definitely refreshing and i cannot wait for season two
ive been reading the books over and over since i was  years old  needless to say i was ecstatic about the show it didnt disappoint thank you for making it
i created an imdbaccount for this review why because i cant get over bridgerton im jaelous of you if you havent watched it yet it is romantic entertaining the set and dresses are amazing and the storyline kept me captivated from start to finishespecially the chemistry and intimacy between the two main characters simon too sexy my goodness  daphne is so addictive how they managed to bring across their emotions via eye contact slight touches etc made me start to believe in love again yes im aware thats not realistic but still in short must watch you wont be dissapointed
"its a must watch
loved the characters the storyline the scenery great job super entertaining and worth to watch"
"everything was perfect the costume the music the storyline the dances scenes are also fabulous at last the cast is diverse and so good why do we need to exclude good actors because its not historically accurate gosh movies are fictions  i am so mad that hollywood chose white people playing leading roles in asianbased stories is it proper think also of elisabeth taylor playing cleopatra  which is totally inaccurate for sure
i do love the bridgertons books by julia quinn and i love the changes made the story of marina which is not in the book echoes to the sad story of the wretched girl in sense ans sensibility but here we do not hide the girl who loses her virtue she is dignified siena the opera singer is not the ever lost and miserable girl as we found in many historical romances she is proud and choses her destiny i do agree with the feminist view
i personally love the duke played by regé jean page his acting is really smart and subtle i do hope he will be the next james bond for he is able to show a new face of masculinity with humour
i also love eloise violet bridgerton and the queen they were brilliant
i was not a great fan of anthony and im afraid the season  will not be as good if he takes the lead anyway i am looking forward watching it
thanks to shondaland and netflix for this great christmas treat i watch and rewatch the series with delight"
"sorry but i could watch only for  min the queen who behaves like a drank sailor in a pub where is the grace and benevolence really
editing my first review after seeing a high score ratings tried to whatch one more time picked episode  no it is impossible i have very sophisticated taste in movies and degree in art history
this movie is nothing but a disappointment"
what a delicious and addictive candy  is it full of vitamins and nutriments  no but who cares i got exactly what i expected a fun and addictive tv show with great actors and costumes  i love you shondaobviously if you expect a realistic or historical drama maybe thats not the show for you
id recommend trying this show out i like the plot and think the acting is greatheads up they forcibly make minorities royal figures which is completely unrealistic for th century england it is bearable but it is in your face especially when you first start watching itthere are way too many sex scenes that are literally pornographic i wish they werent so detailed
not historically accurate but the series opened up possibilities of how regency life couldve looked like in the past should we have been more open to change  ethnic diversity the colours  set was vibrant the cast captivated the scenes the story mesmerising  the one liners funny as did not read the books but binged season  throughout christmas   loved it cant wait for the second season coming in march  nb there is an exhorbitant amount of sex scenes that one can do without otherwise it did not phase from the storyline
i loved it the sets the storyline showcasing how much women have had to overcome and helps me appreciate how far we have come that aside omg amazing
this is a fantasy theres no actual magic but this isnt reality and its not trying to be its an idealized alternate dimension where everything ends up alright and everyone who ends up together belongs together theres very little substance here and i can see why that irks some people i for one could not be more pleased no other show has properly shown the inherent eroticism of the brushing of fingertips against skin the temptation of a slowly removed glove the breathless anticipation that most romance novels can only dream of capturing i spent a full decade of my life voraciously reading victorian romance novels trying to find something this good and this is the crème de la crème of the genreif youre upset about historical accuracy id say thats like watching game of thrones and being upset that it doesnt accurately portray the middle ages thats not the point and its relationship with reality is not meant to be anything more than the gentle brushing of shoulders of strangers in a crowd if youre upset about the racial representation go back to the s where you belong and let the rest of us enjoy ourselvesfor those seeking more like this dont bother with the books at least not the first one although i cant imagine the author discovers how to write less ridiculously shallow and sexist characters between books one and twoi will say that my major gripe is the instance of female to male sexual assault its saved barely by the character having no understanding of such things but i completely understand anyone who decides to opt out of the show as a consequence its not right and the show doesnt do enough to portray the seriousness of such actions she never really learns her lesson and were left with yet another instance of media not portraying male victims as well victims if it happens again on the show it sets a pattern and ill opt out of future seasons
jane austen is spinning in her grave im waiting to see if netflix makes a movie about nelson mandela with matt damon playing him really disappointed
diversity at its best  in a word simon the rest of the cast did their best to wow us but all fell short that said i look forward to season  that will allow other characters to shine bravo
"it is really good i just hoped they would change the rape scene i mean there was no need for that scene and they made it look like daphne was a victim
other than that it truly is great"
"i liked the fact that poc were represented
and it was very interested although i dont understand some of the words but yeah"
bingewatched it loved rewatched it the story is original characters matched wonderfully will definitely watch all following seasons
bridgerton is a lavish and engaging period drama that brings a refreshing twist to the genre with its diverse casting and modern sensibilities the shows scandalous plot gorgeous costumes and captivating performances make it a mustwatch for fans of historical fictionbridgerton the netflix original series set in regencyera england explores the importance of marriage and family in society the show follows the lives of several families as they navigate the intricacies of courting and marriage in high society bridgerton highlights the social expectations placed upon individuals to marry well and secure their familys future however it also emphasizes the importance of choosing a partner for love and mutual respect the show portrays the ups and downs of relationships and the impact they have on both the individuals and their families bridgerton is a captivating and beautifully crafted series that masterfully delves into the complexities of marriage and family
i understand its based on the bridgestone family however omitting some of the characters from season  like simon made season  uninteresting anthony and kate dont have the fire to keep a whole season going probably wont bother with season also they shouldve kept lady whistledown a secret longer
ignore the idiots complaining about historical inaccuracies and colorblind casting i dont want to write spoilers so ill just say that they clearly didnt watch episode  this is not a show for people who want serious historical drama its just good romantic fun
"such a kinda beautiful story with lovely cast and main is acting are really incredible
i was literally completed in a one day such a fantastic series and cinematography is perfect really i was thinking i was in past"
i seriously think people nowadays just need to find something to complain about it this show isnt realistic its a show its a fantasy in fact its a fantasy of rich aristocratic families so of course we wont relate but i loved it for those saying its shallow pride  prejudice circles around the same themes sure this show is more lusty and the duke is fine as hell but the problems are the same finding matches to marry aristocratic families who lived in the lap of luxury had nothing better to do back then but try and find ways to entertain themselves so of course you can look at it as shallow or you can loosen up and enjoy i found it easy to get wrapped up in the main love story theyre believable together and have great chemistry the loves scenes are enough to make a grown woman blush for those saying its not historically correct some shows dont need to be none of us had a problem with brandy being cinderella and the prince being the asian son of a white man and whoopi goldberg lighten up all in all i was sad to see this season end and i thoroughly enjoyed it looking for to the seasons to come
love this series love the humour love the drama n love the storyline cant wait for the nd book series 😍😍
i wouldve given this tripe a  if it had been intended as a comedy the plot lines are like the worst telenovela but without the acting i have no problem with the historical inaccuracy but the ridiculous writing bordering on insulting makes me laugh out loud if youve ever seen the snl skit the californians just imagine that taking place in early th century england everyone associated with this drivel should be ashamed of themselves however if you look at it as a comedy it is uproarious having done so i feel slightly less cheated out of a couple hours of my life fabio should have been cast in the lead so that everyone would know this is an absolute joke i would rather eat a toenail off a nyc subway floor than watch another episode
i absolutely love love love this show it is so easy to just turn on and sit down to watch i loved the characters and build up they had throughout the first and second season the first season was amazing and definitely my favorite i also loved how they focused on one character in a season i thought it showed variety and character development after watching previous seasons i anticipated the new season very much but i was a little disappointed this season didnt have as much build up as the other seasons did i dont get the same feeling watching it as i did the previous seasons but still an amazing fun show i would totally recommend and is a much watch if you have netflix
i would recommend season  definitely it was charming and the characters made you fall in love with them it is not an actual historic piece but a sweet story i think my title of this review nails it however season  was difficult to finish in respect that there was zero chemistry between the leading love interests if i can get through season  and have a change of heart i might revisit this review
the dramatic balance in bridgerton is outstanding there are plenty of historically accurate portrayals of this time period but bridgerton did not set out to be one of them the writers paint a very romantic and artist take on the time period the chemistry between characters can not be overstated and there were just enough twist to keep the audience guessing i had no expectations when i begin watching it and for that i am thankful it should be given an honest chance and enjoyed for its unique approach familiar storyline
i just tried this show because of all that i have seen written of it i have not read the books and im glad i havent yet because sometimes the showsmovies never really do the books justice but let me tell you that i now want to read the books i love period piece shows and movies and this show made me laugh and cry i absolutely loved the spin on who the writer for the gossip paper was it was a wonderful surprise it broke my heart everytime penelope got her heart broke and cried it made me cry right along with her and i thought it was perfect that she was the writer and the love story between the duke and future duchess was lovely i cant wait for season two and to get my hands on the booms
loved every min of this series all of the actors were amazing i fell in love with simon i love that it took me away from all of the hate and turmoil in this world for several hours
yes its beautifully shot they incorporate contemporary music in a classical arrangement but wellwritten it is not the plot is aimless the character development is as thin as the dialogue i dont care about any of the characters and even if we put aside that this is a poor knockoff of gossip girl in a regency style its not done well and lacks all of the nuance clever banter and explanation of manners of the era that make classics like pride and prejudice work even when redone as clueless bridgerton is to period dramacomedies what grey poupon is to fine dining
yeap the main actor is handsome he steals the show
"i´m on my rd run watching this show i cant get enough of it
refreshing dramatic funny and romantic
i recommend watching it and just ignore the bad reviews so glad i´ve seen this before i read the bad reviews to know they are wrong"
this show has romance drama and comedy and is definitely a nice twist to a period drama it does not take itself too seriously and should be taken with a pinch of salt in places and enjoyed for the romp that it isthe casting is brilliant there is great chemistry between all of the actors and the show does a good job with character development and arcsit is set loosely in the regency period but really it is a world of its own it centres on the bridgerton family who are of british nobility and follows other notable families and characters that come into contact with them each series is focused on a different bridgerton and their quest to marry and ultimately find love the first series follows daphne the eldest daughter the second series follows anthony the eldest son and the head of the familyi have watched both series and enjoyed them both my favourite was the second series i really enjoyed the dynamics between kate and anthony and the sharmas are a great addition to the show that being said both series are greatthis is a show about family love and friendship and how that is navigated in the world the characters live in it looks at some serious themes but it doesnt take itself too seriously and it is very well done it has sex drama scandal and humour it is a show to be watched and enjoyed
probably the longest blooming wisteria cherries and peaches on this planet so lovely
bad writing bad acting bad costuming  bad everything and while it is currently politically correct to ignore ethnicity when casting for movies doing so backfires entirely when it so egregiously contradicts historical fact and reality avoid this bit of hollywood fantasy
beautiful casts gorgeous costumes and care to every detail in every scene the yearning and slow burn are so delicious some parts were a bit slow but understandable because nature of the tv show
"it is nothing new period drama meets saucy scenes downtown abbey at its worst
too much for me for something that was promising too much ended really disappointing"
very interesting movie stuffed up in an serial good trailer interesting seconds actors disappointed continuing
to me it felt like they were trying to force a storyline but they themselves just didnt know how to execute it not just with daphne but like even with lady whistledown i cannot tell you how many times i forgot about lady whistledown until they mentioned her with daphne and the duke everything happened so quickly there was hardly any tension no jealousy or burning declarations of love which is what you expect from these period pieces because its taboo to express your romantic feelings openly during that era and when that happens its like the most raw and intimate thing shared between two characters the rain scene in pride and prejudicebut they just couldnt execute it well enoughi love the duke regé jeanpage i think hes very hot and its about time we had a man of colour portray the handsome royal in these shows but even with his storyline they couldve done so much with his childhood trauma his daddy issues i feel like he shouldve had in fact he deserved to go on that heros journey and finding out that hes not this emotionally detached fukboy that he thinks he is i feel like we were robbed of his emotional development and seeing his feelings for daphne develop as he finally accepted himself as the man he is when hes with daphnei feel like he shouldve left the country so that there was something he and daphne both yearned for some burning desire that was emotional and not just physical and then when he came back in the next season preferablythey could reunite and have that burning love that indistinguishable fiery passion because they realised what they mean to each otherthat being said i did enjoy it i think its light entertainment fun to watch a bit slow at times and some storylines can easily be removed but the clothes jewellery the set design is remarkable so just dont expect a lot from the first season and youll be a happy viewer lets see what happens in the nd season
a historical fiction relying heavily on the fiction
i love this show i love the settings and the costumes everything is so extravagant and beautiful i do think they increase the saturation on the images but it works everything is so beautiful it makes me want to go back and live a high life in the endlish society the story lines are great with different scenarios and never the same love story twice yet the newest season made me swoon i cant wait for the second half to come out the sex scene are very tasteful even though they are basically soft core porn but what else would we women want all the couples are sooo cute i cant wait until eloise meets someone
i am very disappointed outlander wasnt one of the nominees
i would never have given this show a glance had it not been so highly recommended by youtuber roaming reckless now im hooked and cant wait to see how the rest of the episodes unfold love all the characters and enjoy watching their individual story take shapeif i had to pick a favorite or two it would be penelope and the duke of hastings those two characters are deep and so very human in the damage done to them and how they hide their scars and do their best to put one foot forward and find balance in their lives the scenery is rich and beautiful and the dialog is clever and witty there are life lessons to be learned along the way if we are open to hear and see them

the same selfappointed critics complaining about historical accuracy to the detail are probably the same people who believe todays news media is accurate at all the same who champion it as being diverse which is historically divisive in reality even if the current globalist push forces it down western cultures throats and borders would be the same screaming for ethnic authenticity in characters time periods but those are the ones that want to have cake and eat it too several reviews mention how the show whitewashes a tragic period in history seeming not to realize that its always done in entertainment to all ethnicities follow the money if you want to know whos pushing certain agendas but good luck getting the group that owns all the media to listen to you slavery is a touchy topic surely but this is not a story about slavery and if you want accuracy which the highly sensitive but historicallyallergic mob seems to demand better start with africans who were the first and remaining owners of slaves is the truth too hard to show perhaps just unpalatable but this is entertainment like the mass majority of the media if you havent realized that yet turn off the tv altogether or at least do your mind and the world a favor and stop believing the divideandconquer news and consider yourself above the real plague of inaccuracieslets hope love conquers all
ive seen the tudors and loved everything about it ive seen versailles and it was absolutely fantastic now this show here is utterly bad disgusting and shows horrible actors too i cant believe how anyone in the world would want to continue watching this bs after episode  absolutely the biggest nightmare of tv shows in history ever
this is definitely a nice little soap which someone can binge watch in one lazy weekendi felt  at season was better than the next one basis of wit sarcasm feminism and last but not the least role of lady whistletownlady w was lost somewhere in the nd season the love story suddenly became the only thing going on a bit cliché but entertaining nonetheless
supposedly set in london but clearly filmed in bath the dialogue is absolutely cringeworthy and clearly written by americans who think putting shall in front of every verb makes the language regency embarrassing the acting is terrible and this show has no historical accuracy whatsoever austen would turn over in her grave if she new this gaudy brash overthetop trash is masquerading as austenesque
as someone who really loves the show and been waiting for this season since the moment the last season ended i expected so much unfortunately so far season  is not deliveringfirst of all we only have  episodes which cuts our enthousiasme right in the middlesecond this seasons couldve been the funniest with a quirky penelope and a colin becoming obsessed with her as she progresses but we dont much of thatspoiler  the kissing scene was bad for my opinion we needed build up and more time of that scene more sensuality and more close ups to their faces their stress the intensity of that moment and the moment penelope says thank you i laughed cuz that was not even a kiss for my opinionthird if eloise turns out gay im stopping the show and no turning back like i wouldnt mind any other character to be gay but not eloise and finally i feel the cast were not convinced nor invested in this season theres no flow in the progress of events and unfortunately and unexpectedly im disappointed
i cant wait for netflix to make roots with a white and asian family that experience the horrors of racismaristocrats all over the world mix races all the timenot every series that is made needs to contain a group of friends that has every race every gender as that doesnt match realitythis is the type of show guys get forced to watch to appease their other half but have to cringe through all the crap that is clearly not the way the world was in that region during that time period
"my wife has had to sit through some pretty dire tv series of mine with little complaint but never anything as truly shockingly awful as this pile of steaming excrement that i endured at her request
netflix have made fools of themselves and their subscribers by putting this innacurate woke embarrassing and unintentionally hilarious mess of an adaptation on
ive never shook my head as much watching tv id have given it zero stars but the  goes to my wife for not losing her st with me for my persistent carping about this utter garbage"
disagree with positive reviews do not get taken in by report that many are watching nothing in this matches masterpice period dramas except for the male lead lorrd hastings the cast is uninteresting overall and the story is poor i made it through five episodes now regret and will not return for more i admire shonda rhimes i like the cast diversity but the story does not hold i cannot understand making the female lead an object of attraction she just is notpoor casting very trite i was not going to watch but did because of an enthusiastic critic wasted  hourswill not return and who cares about trite brother anthony whose story is the second season  he is a jerk
the sets are spectacular the costumes wonderful the acting very decent and there it ends the story is contrived the use of a united nations cast is a huge distraction and the script get annoying at timesworth a watch yes  but dont expect the grip of downtown abbey
in my book not everything needs to be shondaized i found the plot and acting forced and modernizing both the costumes and music felt out of place at least the book allows you to imagine youre reading jane austen even though its just gossip girl fan fiction whereas the series just makes you wish you were watching something else disappointing
i adored season one season  was such a let down the writing is bad and the two lead females are horrible actresses there is literally no chemistry between kate and the viscount the scenes seem awkward and forced they have about two hostile conversations with each other and miraculously the viscount is madly in love and she is all he can think about totally unbelievable and a complete let down after the beautifully written first season
"the first season of bridgerton created quite a stir when it was released leaving passionate viewers impatiently waiting for a season  i loved the passion between the duke and daphne and the whole storyline was charming seductive and no disappointment the duke of hastings absence in the second season is a huge void unable to be filled by the eldest son of the bridgerton family although he was introduced in the first season having sex on a tree the second season waits painstakingly long for anthony and kate to do the dirty deed it was excruciatingly tiresome throughout the hour long eight episodes to ultimately be a lackluster and extremely modest storyline part of the craze of bridgerton were the steamy sex scenes but in the second season it felt inauthentic and a strange montage rather than passion desire and that authenticity for their first timehowever some shows do entice viewers by adding shock value with lots of steamy scenes for the first season and then tame the beast from season  on hopefully the views and reviews of season  will let the show creators know the sweet spot to get back to the greatness of the first season when they start production on season  and  unfortunately they may have lost a lot of viewers myself included with the tragedy of the second seasonseason   stars
season   stars"
i have tried  episodes cannot do iti have thoroughly enjoyed period pieces in the past whether drama romance or just plain fun this is so silly  and not in a good way and flat what is there to enjoy
the acting style is painful to watch costume and set choices are tacky i cringed through the first episode hoping it would get better it didnt if you are looking for an imaginativefunny period piece watch the great instead
"dearest readersbridgerton a mixture of prideprejudice and gossip girl not my words is back and let me tell you bridgerton and prideprejudice have still as much in common as gilmore girls and ginnygeorgia another dreadful netflix series i do not recommend to watch exactly nothingso predictable one couldnt even classify it as guilty pleasure anymore so tedious was it the unnecessary  and excessive sex scenes were thank god missing this time and instead we got numerous scenes of the love interests loudly and exaggeratedly breathing at each otherthe majority of the characters feel very two dimensional and stereotypical even more than last season though they try to explain their actions by adding traumatic backstories i have never seen those sort of characters before sarcasm over
bridgerton has again chosen the enemiestolovers trope like in last season one could blame the novel for this idea however it feels lazily executed by our no  medical drama queen shonda rhimesi could write a whole essay about all the things i got so fed up about while watching this series but instead ill save you some time and simply tell you to watch a real pride and prejudice adaption insteadyours truly lady washitdown"
this series could have been a hour long movie all the episodes seem to be a repititive and same plot of people attending some fancy party organised by one of the rich society memberthe overthetop high society act of the bygone ages fails to keep the audience on the hook for more than  episodeswhy do they have to show such fairytale story kind of series which shows nothing more than cliched and pretentious society does not have any thrill and so much predictive storyline with you already predicting who would pair with whom eventuallythough it gets interesting somewhere inbetween but overall just a repititive matchmaking fairytale story with just the candidates changing
it is a waste of time to watch season  the main characters this season made it look like a child play no real acting lots of looking onlyfirst season was good and it makes you wanna know what happens next i fast forwarded a lot season  because it is boring and awkward
bypassing the historical inaccuracies of season one season one had more of an enjoyable feel to watch but this season seems to be glorifying narcissism and other abusive relationships further more there seems to be a disconnect between the main friendship shes more of a stalker then a friend its just horrible
i tried so hard to get into this series normally if the first  episodes dont catch my attention i turn it off i gave this one wayyyy too many chance after watching each agonizing episode i thought there has to be something really good in the next episode from all of this hype im hearing nope nothing ever happened its horrible like teen disney channel acting horrible dont waist your time if youre looking for a great romance series masters of sex is phenomenal
according to most current and pressing issue with this show is diversity however the true fault in this show is its acting and plot  the fundamentals of creating a good show the plot is to put it simply incoherent and ridiculously produced i could not work out whether or not the show was a parody in addition the acting is shocking and a true insult to modern theatre i was terribly disappointed usually i like to be introduced to new actors and shows but this offensive portrayal of aristocrats and the belowaverage representation of film actors left me with nothing but secondhand embarrassment and disgust
must we be asked to accept these period pieces with contemporary diversity an insult to intelligence
 you wont even get one star woke comrades this is a complete travesty did you even go to school or you just live in some weird pathetic dreamworld do not waste your time and money on this  not allowed to write it down
of course another film where we apparently need to rewrite history because some people cant handle truth and facts there are way too many sensitive people in this world these days
the characters are typically politically correctly barring in mind this is supposed to be  and bearing in mind slavery wasnt abolished until 
just awful pretentious wet dull self indulgent cack dont waste your time and electricity watching it go count lorries on the a or time how long it takes for a tree to grow daft accents daft acting daft music
season  had its flaws but was light and enjoyable a season  was utter rubbish non sense not one story line credible and most characters unlikable a  as i cant rate a zero
this series is so slathered in pc wokeness it entirely misses its mission to entertain insulting and pathetic  avoid at all cost  watching even one episode will lower your iq by  points
bizarre highschool dramedy period piece bad casting and acting
this show has literally nothing to offer it was a huge disappointment
a black duke and a white aristocratic lady in regency era  on top of the terrible d rated acting and totally pc woke casting give me a break totally ruined my beloved memories of reading these books there is nothing that can suspend my imagination to see all these black actors playing period roles that are so unrealistic
reimagining history is a tricky endeavor even in expert hands but this is awful theres no rhyme or reason to it
as someone who loves period dramas downton abbey is my favorite show ever i was so excited about this show unfortunately i do not understand the high praise its getting the costume design is great and some of the scenery is good but a lot of it looks like cgi i love all the diversity but i actually think there should be more representation im surprised that the two main families are made up of completely white actors my biggest complaint is the writing and casting of simon and daphne the show presents  stakes poor girl she has to choose between two rich handsome men and daphnes character is so boring the actors who play simon and daphne are fine on their own but they have  chemistry together im so happy for everyone who does think they have chemistry i wish i could see it maybe theres something wrong with me but i find their interactions so cringy and forced im mainly watching the rest of the season for penelope and eloise as i find them to be the most interesting however i dont think id watch a second season and thats sad
good netflix shows are very rare these days watched the first episode of bridgerton and that was enough another stupid series that makes no sense with netflix trying to show how woke they are skip it and do what our family is doing now watching friends reruns and other s shows for some decent television
"period dramas are my favorite type of showmoviefilmbooketc bridgerton turned out to by only a display of luxurious costumes and house settings  one of those cheap stories with no spice i tried  times to go past the rd episode and succeeded only the th time it gets a bit better in the second half when i thought there was finally something to happen
i accepted the the shock of wokeness  black aristocracy and queen contemporary music and in balls  rand hoped it could be fun and diverse it wasnt a good story good dialogues good acting could have made an interesting approach for the inclusivenessdiversity concept they didnt exist"
i have not read the book its a fantasy novel ok i have no problem with the cast diversity  its the sole redeeming feature i just cant understand why anyone would make such crap why engage such a talented crew to produce rubbish like this
if you like telenovelas maybe this is for you no depth at all
not real i will watch downton abbey for the fourth time instead of this mess
this program has so much cheese they should have called it wisconsin
first of all if someone would make a movie or tv series about the ancient ghana kingdom it would be nonsense to cast white people as the main characters why does it not work in reverse it is stupid and fake to do as bridgerton does the past is the past acknowledge and accept itthen about the rest in my honest opinion the plot is incredibly predictable poorly written and the acting is not convincing especially dafnes one i found her quite obnoxious at times
the charm of julia quinns bridgerton novels is in the truly likeable and engaging characters the tv shows has made them bland and obnoxious unlike some reviewers the diverse casting doesnt bother me the terrible adaptation of some of my favourite novels does god awful i cant get past the first episode its just a travesty
its the worst th century tv show the show have nothing to do with how they talk and live in that century i have read and watched a lot books and moves and tv show about that century and they have nothing do to with bridgerton its a waist of time i watch a the episodes only because i want to have a complete opinion and to find out what happen in the end
generally poorly acted and with superficial character development too fast paced between scenes jumps around
like watching paint dry but even worse my wife decided to given it a try and i spent most of the te staring at my phone waiting for it to be over
i cannot believe that this has so many  star reviews its one of those shows you try because youve watched everything else on the top  list except cocomelon shudders the girlfriend hits play and we watched  episodes that night hoping it would get better finished it off the next couple days and had to figure out why it got good reviewsi literally made this account in case it saves someone the  hours of this show pick something else
absolute garbage i thought it was a american parody or was it  the actors are one dimensional very predictable  if you want to throw  hours away fill your boots for the life of me i can not understand how it has a score of over  generally i will give anything with a score of over  a shot but this was just bad bad bad dont even get me started over the diversity issue but if in fact it wasnt a parody then at least try to make it too have some semblance on being historically correct instead of making it politically correct if i could give it zero i certainly would have done utter trash
ive just finished borgia the showtime production and it was so satisfying to watch yeah they took a lot of liberties it wasnt accurate but still you could immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the time im watching rn shogun not historically correct but following a legend character which opened the eyes of the viewers to a special time in the japan history a window to a culture with such authentic souland then bridgerton oh god its a preposterous representation of an european culture viewed through the eyes of americans as all too americanized productions bridgerton could be very well categorized as a total circus flashy but with no trace of authentic feeling an impotent understanding of europeans just sick of it
pedestrian predictable pandering ploddinggood costumes and good setsjust film an actual austen novel againfor all the brouhahajust a basic take with tropes
"yes embarrassing what a way to ruin a book ruin history it upsets to think that julia quinn who wrote the source material that was so well researched in all areas sold her rights to made into this drivel i hate to say julia quinn who was my go to reread will never be reread again i am so sad the someone should sell her vision to be made into this embarrassing tosh i admired writers who hold on to their dreams rowling meyer and even el james
just so so embarrassing"
its awful i felt no emotional connection to the characters netflix adaptations are soo bad
those telling you this is ok are the ones crying all day about cultural appropriation bunch of hypocritesthe series is empty and fake as much as the cult that made itit is an insult to jane austen an insult to british culture history and cinemaanother example of ideological fanatics pretending to be artists while all they want is to push their propaganda via every medias they can get their hands onthese guys would make soap that doesnt wash just to push their propaganda on the boxsame thing here this movie has no other purpose then to put diversity where it doesnt belonglife is too short to be subjected to such bad material
this show is not only wildly inaccurate in its period depictions but also incredibly pretentious distastefully raunchy and just all around trash entertainment
i just decided to watch it for julie andrews being in it but the historical inaccuracy id rather that it didnt explain the existence of the colored characters and just made it a normal thing though that wouldnt make much sense either but if you came for julie andrews dont bother watching this just go watch mary poppins or the sound of music again😆
didnt like the love story was so predictable from the moment they met it was known she was going to act like she didnt care for anthony but forced him on edwina i saw edwina more pure n noble to be w anthony than kate but lust won more than love love came after hurting her sister but again fairytale story that was not what i expected edwina was even prettier the only thing worth watching the series was the secret story line of penelope other than that thumbs down 👎🏼 i get anthony was feeling obligated to marry n choose edwina he needed to feel love its just courting one sister n marrying the other thats a messed up 💩 only in that fake world of appearances also i get its a book it happened still can say dont like it sorry not sorry my own opinion n vent respect
 is more than deserving couldnt go through the first episode i dont care if its fiction its too inaccurate acting is mediocre and bad costumes are overstated and just too much the storyline is weak cringey ive read a review stating that the soundtrack includes ariana grande why how the whole thing felt like a school play with a bunch of kids dressed up running around without making any sense i am judging those who rated it positively an insult to cinema
this started out boring then got more boring as it droned on i continued to watch it for the benefit of my wife she loved it as probably all women domy idea of hell watching this for eternity
complete and utter trash theres nothing good to be said about this except that im glad theres a stop button
"both me and my wife think this is one of the worst costume drama ever its completely meaningless stupid and overly dramatic it feels like a cheap pocket novel from  for girls
i cant understand why it got so much publicity in the media
if u want the opposite watch a serie like mrselfridges instead thats the best costume drama ever"
awful acting shamefull cast and a cheesy story besides the few plottwists there is nothing exciting about the story
no glass slipper no fairy godmother no besotted prince scouring the towns and villages in search of his one true love no heroin the blacksheep fated to be an indentured slave to her social climbing petty petty bourgeoisie step familywho ends up being queen of snowdoviera midsized fiefdom in prussiain this period piece depicting the pageantry of imperial britain at its height of power the story centers on the romantic travails betwixt two members of the aristocracy as well as having to contend with the social prejudices of the era they also have to contend with the unspeakable horrors of obscene wealth servants tending to their every whim and being considered the quintessential example of ascetic western beauty its just tragic some people just cant a breakat the conclusion of the i am repelled by you now i think i might like you now i really hate you bit when they finally realise what we have known all along that its heightened sexual tension and they desperately want to shag one another and so as the shagadelic heat meter is flashing red hot simon suddenly pulls out at the last second without explanation that leaves daphne confused perplexed and one would suspect having to resort to manual sexual relief on more than one occasion as battery operated joysticks had yet to be inventedwe had already been made privy as to the bulwark that was preventing the union of their hearts and bodily parts as simon had sworn an oath to spite a dying father whom he despised informing him that he would not marry and have children and so the family line would die with him this continuation of the family line was of paramount importance to his aristocratic father in other words daphne had not yet realised that simon was a bewilderingly infantile spiteful moron and that she should ran for the hillssimon takes an oath to spite a dying father who dies less than a minute later and who is therefore unlikely to continue to stew over the end of the family line for the negligible angst he may have caused his now deceased father simon being a man of honour irreproachable a man of his word is going to spite himself and turn away the women of his dreams should she one day knock upon his door in order to keep an oath made to spite a dead man he despised witnesses by no onein context of the series there is no reason that simon cannot just reveal his reasons instead of leaving others at a loss to understand his contradictory behavior other than to depict him as the stoic martyr bearing the cross he must carry in silence without complaint in the real world he would remain silent because he would justly fear being criticized as an infantile imbecileit would not matter when this whatever it is was set its idiotic in any period however to have coloured people portrayed as accepted equals including the queen no less is just bewildering at a moment in history when western powers had just drawn up the borders of africa that they were invading slaughtering and enslaving millions and pilfering resources that has never ceased the west drew up the borders at the berlin conference  in order to prevent hostilities breaking out between the imperialist despots
terrible adaptation without respect to the book to the historical facts and that tries to adapt to the politically correct of the current society
while i appreciate the fact that the sex scenes in season  were fewer and far less pornographic the two main characters are completely unlikeable and have zero chemistry after three episodes the i hate youi love youi hate youi love you sceneries became quite tedious this season could have been wrapped up in a  hour movie i ended up playing word puzzles on my phone during the last few episodes because i really didnt care what happened to these two insufferable characters the only bright light in this disaster was the character edwina
this is like an attempt to have an oldfashioned setting but with a modern touch to it and it doesnt work at all feels like a theatre rehearsal and none of it rings true no real emotion or depth just misappropriated costume drama doesnt at all capture whatever these shows are supposed to capture downton abbey did it far betterthere are so many things wrong with this but if i go into details my review will probably get blocked i only recently noticed most of my reviews have been rejected and so i suppose there are a lot of words you cant use including words i would not consider at all offensive
tired of netflix laziness do something different
trashy and not historically accurate not even remotely entertaining shallow storyline and uninteresting characters
"not even good for some historical approach full of very bad acting and insane political correct bs is weird that they not use a black actor for the king character
please not waste a second in this show"
season  deserves a  rating now season  more like  the horse racing was probably the best part of this show because no one was talking a very predictable premise indeed the two future lovers hate each other then eventually get together blahblahblah for this season i didnt even care if they got together there was no chemistry between the viscount and kate their dance and their intimate moments were robotic kate is stuck up and stiff and cannot act frankly she was just annoying the fact that her sister forgave her so easily was annoying as well the featheringtons were even more annoying in the second season and i didnt think that was possible i can honestly say that my favorite characters were lady danbury and the queenthey kept me entertained at least
season  was very good  out of  season  i cant even bring myself to finish it  boring boring boring the writers have failed to come up with anything original for season  and are basically trying to repeat season  but without the excitement
at least we would have gotten more of the actual story as written i cant believe julia quinn agreed to this unrecognizable adaptation to a truly enjoyable story this trashy novella was not worth putting on film
this show is so bland it should be in black and white the characters have nowell character they are dull and lifeless i dont understand how the producers looked at the final cut of the first episode and thought yes this is a winner
i would probably give this series a higher rating if i had not read the book daphne and family bears little resemblance to the characters that quinn created and that i fell in love withdaphne is not a diamond of the first water in fact she is quite on the shelf her brother while being defined as a rake has always put his family first violet bridgerton would have never allowed her son to speak to her as anthony did in the first episode the only characters that roughly resemble the book are eloise and simoni have no issue with color of any of the actors however it does seem a bit forced that said the only reason why i gave this  stars is because of pages performancei waited so long for this and feel like the wonderful bridgertown family and the differences between them and the normal s british families have been so violated
bridgerton is not my cup o tea ordinarily id pass on even commenting on it but the construct of color blindness was so breathtakingly insensitive i felt it was important to raise an objection romance novels are mind fodder for those unwilling or unable in some cases to risk their own pride and feelings in actual relationships romance differs from love stories by being trite overly simplified with a cast of stock players in stock plots moved around by the author like plays on a chess board the cleverness of the moves may be the only thing that could be interestingat least for mebridgerton holds itself up a something socially daring and its breathtakingly the opposite while giving the female characters a platform to voice their persecution and control by the patriarchy all in a very stock way the racial inclusiveness and what thats meant to erase is just wiped clean without a word of acknowledgement of the suffering white male and female society perpetrated on people of color like the snap of a finger there its gone if youre not going to address the implications of setting people of color on an equal basis in society why even bring it up because its too complicated too painful or is it just unimportant and not worth mentioning despite claims to the contrary it comes across as the latter and its very offensive to watch no matter all that did happen in the summer of and while development of the material and its production predates the worldwide uproar of racial killings in  the choice to release bridgerton could have been delayed out of sensitivity for the inane concept of casting under the auspices of color blindnessthat aside a costume bodice ripper no matter the excuse of showing it from the females point of view lacks the authority of what sofia coppolla for instance did with marie antoinette bridgerton is really just a ripoff of coppolas workand the entire effort is sunk by our attitude towards coerced sexual acts whether by a man or woman which was dealt a serious blow by the woke movement dressing it up here and tying it in silken bows and fancy dresses and not even weighing in on its damage was a seriously retrograde choice fie on it
"i dont care what color the actors are or even about the inclusion of modern music but i do care how the characters are completely butchered compared to the books im a huge quinn fan and this series although welcome in theory fails to capture the subtleties of each character and the humor of the narration i want more period pieces on netflix yes but please dont call this one bridgerton
i wish i hadnt read the books perhaps id have enjoyed it more"
im sure all the fuss about this series is due to the fact that nearly everyone in the world is in lockdown or under some form of social restrictions as a result we are all bored to death and will latch onto anything that pleases the senses the show has arrived during an extremely weak year for new productions and thus has little competition i do like the diversity refreshing
watching bridgerton is like a painting see from far away its ok but up close its a big ol messthis sums up my experience with this series which i abandoned after a couple episodes of season  blander than boiled chicken but i returned to watch season sighthis show needed a brit writing it everything is surface appeal the costumes and sets are sumptuous the acting passable but the storyline is a snooze there is no intrigue nor tantalizing machinations just boring people trapped in a never ending marriage market even the few feminist are uninteresting in their constant protestations of equality but become weak in knees in the face of their masculine crushesi dont know what it is about shondaland productions but i always end up not liking or rooting for anyone and that blows because why watch a show if you cant get investedwatch if youre between shows
dont waste your time on this unentertaining derivative dross the misappropriation aspect has been well covered in other reviews i could tolerate that if bridgerton has a decent plot decent writing likeable characters etc but it doesntthis show is just another political vehicle to appeal to millenials nothing in it for the rest of us
complaining in detail about the painfully inyourface writing the abscence of any character development the jarringly wooden dialogue the ridiculously stenciled acting the embarassingly obvious low cost music or the fact that a piece of media which at least pretends to be history related is not only pure fiction but also decisively disregardful of its matter would be a waste of time its not really an attempt at storytelling or filmmaking but rather a product designed by the numbers to appease the lower instincts of a strictly defined target audience this is mainly done by the good ol cheap humiliation of the reverse aggregate of people of course handing out payoff after payoff without putting in the pesky effort for buildupsone extra star for the costumes which naturally are ahistorical but also the only corner that wasnt cut as a postscript i do recommend scrolling through the reviews here and form your own oppinion on how this kind of reception could have formed a  rating
"i had no idea how many black members of the nobility there were in th century in london apparently its an alternative london anyway it seems permanently bright sunshine it rains only  times because it was conducive to eroticism
i liked the chemistry between simon and dephne but watching them have sex for a whole episode honestly the show is for kids but theyre not allowed to watch it because of all the sex poor historical realization if you dont understand history you should leave it alone"
so much of what i wanted to say has already been said in audience reviews about this comically inept steaming pile of historical revisionism that just a few words will do the only positive outcome of what amounts to a serial version of fetid phlegm is that it has inspired witty and deliciously sardonic reviews by discerning critics as for the professional critics tripping over themselves to virtuesignal their approval of this woke dreck we see right through you and we laugh oh how we laugh
"can it be that the series like bridgerton and emily in paris tell so much more about america and the american culture than about the europe they strive to represent
if so the picture is empty and ignorant yet packaged perfectlyread full review on tanya  gervasi  com "
why do you have to ruin everything with your so called wokeness there are adaptations and then there is this mess was looking forward to a second season but gave up at the second episode
it is too girly the plot is so shallow and it is not historically accurate overall it is corny
the book was written to be fun humorous and light hearted it was a great story and it was more correct for the periodthis adaptation was a piece of trash the show writer and director both and i use these titles loosely took a great book and created well i have no idea what that was certainly nothing like the booksit is like watching a train wreck nothing bad about the actors they worked with what was given to them no depth of character that was in the books this could have been so much more instead it was ridiculously sad
this is easily the worst tv show i have ever laid my eyes upon it is nothing but another netflix people pleaser and just an incredibly inaccurate timepiece remake of gossip girl
"i had to stop watching after just a few episodes i personally see nothing wrong with the diversity of the cast accept the fact that the acting is just a no the accents and voices seem so unnatural that when the writers try to capture over hearts it honestly made me cringe the leading actress has vertically no personality and might as well be a plank of wood i havent gotten too far but still and because of this i was more interested in the supporting couples the set and wardrobe are really quite beautiful tho so i guess that counts for something the only reason for the  stars
i just hope that for the sake of my mother who has decided to continue the series get better"
watched an episode because it was getting forced on me it was a load of drivel so much political correctness it hurt the story may have been good but there were so many things in this that just wouldnt have happened back then it bewilders so much that you cant focus on anything else 😅
so weird its as if hollywood fell on its head and lost its minddoes anyone remember what a jewel hollywood used to be before it became woke when the stories were engaging even riveting when funny was funny and sexy was sexy when they reflected reality or fantasy and knew which was whichwhen going to the movies was awesomewatch movies from the s s s and before so many were awesomely good whatever your taste you will love themit has gotten so bad i dont even look at recently made movies or tv shows to see if i might like them i know i wonthype away hollywood it wont help you you are in a death spiral you belong to the chicoms now and you wont last long there
its chicklit tripe like this that makes you realise how astonishingly brilliant jane austen truly was quinn is just another austen wannabe who radically fails to capture any of the nuanceshonda rhimes fantasy that england would cast off racial prejudice at the very time it was starting to ramp up its slave trade to industrial levels is grossly insensitive quite the opposite of being woke and no queen charlotte wasnt black thats a bs theory thats been thoroughly debunked but at least it did give work to some superb actors and provide one of the most magnificent afros to grace the screen so i suppose some good came of it
most people are only watching this because there is nothing else to watch very dull noting special at all it will only be a success because in pandemic times there is nothing else to watch
look its another turgid soap opera that uses mines jane austens tropes to upend traditional roles but really just strengthens them with all the terrible cinemaxlevel sex plus in a time where people are bombarded by fake news from fox to and inaccurate history in texas schools do we really need any more twisting of the truth why romanticize the lifestyle of oppressors which were based on fiefdoms and class systems  all about money money money why not focus on and dramatize perfectly good african and african american history frankly its not unfair to say this disrespectful to englands past and ethnic identity which again there is really no need to romanticize that more than it has been what a wasted opportunity to try something new
what utter drivel dreadful waste of  minutes switch off and watch paint dry
this entire show is a mess and makes zero sense its a fantasy and the demographics absolutely dont exist in reality people need to stop calling it a period piece as if its a reflection of real historyits a fantasy world and a terrible one
doth not a good make another newage travesty if you are making a period piece albeit a whimsical one the period facts and feel should be accurate the acting is stilted most of the time some younger girl actors are a little gems but allaround the acting is uneasy and fake just as are the dialogues the choices of the music are a sort of a bribe for a younger audience but why massacres of perfectly good books is obviously a thing now
ive given up after watching half way through the first episode frothy mindnumbing and certainly not aimed at anyone with more than an iota of intelligence ridiculous representation of the regency period unless we are to suspend all belief i dont think black people were part of english high society and certainly mixed race relationships were not the norm inane one dimensional characters pantomime sets and costumes and anachronistic in every way which even if intentional just does not work also naughty sex scenes randomly thrown in with a view of a naked backside does not a decent drama make what a load of tripe
if youre preadolescent and have no access to the internet this series can sub in for basics of birds and bees or if youre  and want an ideal romance in a fantasy world where color doesnt matter however social standing money and titles still matter do watch for all others pretty much waste of time
horrible pls dont waste your time watching this extremely disappointed in this
cheap story lousy actors and some sex wow what an embarrassing garbage for deluded teenage girls and women who live in a bubble of unicorns and princesses whats wrong with netflix did they really think people want to watch such crap let me tell ya netflix we do not want
so very periodas in  i could only get through a few episodes the series drowns in social posturing finger wagging and virtue signaling that it is a period piece is just a fig leaf its not subtle i like my entertainment sans being smothered by social lecturing thanks
of what being in royal company would be like this may be your cup of tea the brits are still a nation ruled by royals so dont let their stuck up insidious accents fool you they are dumb as ever
we are at that point in the pandemic where people are willing to watch anything i had absolutely no interest in this show to begin with but could not go on social media without hearing people talk about it so decided that i should maybe give it a go it had to be worth my time right wrong it was terrible just as i had expected daphne and simon have zero chemistry and are the most bland people i have ever seen on screen how are we supposed to route for characters that we have absolutely nothing in common with and simply do not care about at all the best part of the show were eloise and penelope but obviously they got almost no screen time and had no significant scenes i hated how barely any other of the characters storylines were explored throughout the shownow lets talk dialogue i found myself cackling during many of the lines in the back end of the series simon and daphne trying to be romantic to one another was so uncomfy they seemed to have kept the direct quotes from the cheesy book and it just did not work well at all on screen i would give examples but i just feel too gross typing them out myself also they have so much sex why do we need to see itlastly the historical setting of the show was not believable whatsoever its as if they simply wrote a crappy season of a teen show but decided to make the characters wear fancy clothes and be british
"a jane austin adaptation which employs the withdrawal method as a means to deceive why would anyone disrespect her legacy in such a way a period piece should at least attempt to approximate the morals and virtues of the time
netflix please how could you possibly cancel amazing shows like travelers but give us this i almost closed my netflix account after travelers was canceled i surely will now"
the editing and background music or lack of it at times makes this show feel like it was done by inexperienced people it almost feels unfinished like the final editing touches and music were not completed
really disappointing no real story beautiful aesthetic but terribly superficial characters
stopped after  minuted maybe they can release this show on sundays after lunch its boring good to make you fall asleep
watched it cause everyone was freaking out about how good it is most bland boring show ive ever made myself sit through just go watch the classic books to novels and youll get so much more than this snooze fest will give you
a one word review would suffice overproduced a few minutes in and i started playing solitaire on my ipad trite predictable script lacks any imagination very little competent acting just uncommitted role playing extravagant sets and costumes do not compensate for an utterly predictable unimaginative production i really wanted to like this and had to watch due to not being the only viewer in the room but its predictability was overwhelming stock characters badly portrayed in unimaginative storylines as well so many inaccuracies regarding the time period  makes you wonder if anyone did any research
what happened to this series  tell me julia why did you sell your story why did you allow shonda to change it that way i am very disappointed 
okay i stuck with bridgeton until the end of the season its a bit of a guilty pleasure and i wondered  just how bad can it getthe storylines are pretty dreadful and dated attempting an abortion via a homemade tea zero sex education and a hotcold love affair forging love letters is pretty lowits hard to emphasize with any of the characters im not really sure why the dialogue is stilted the scenes cut sharply from one to another  theres no finesse in the editingperhaps the most intriguing bit  who is mrs featherington when you find out its rather unbelievable and a let downbut then theres the liberal addition of black characters  but no other races like asians its bizarre considering the realities of the regency time periodthe show feels historically inaccurate in many waysthe costumes are overdone  it looks like someone got drunk and glued on way too many haberdasheries and jewelsthe sets are tacky and tizzy  lets ram as many chandeliers and flowers in as we can lets over decorate the houses with way too much stuffbridgerton is a fan film of the books created with minimal historical research its simply a mills and boom romance based on a fantasy historical period
 out of  try to be too politically correct wrong feel for period drama
i see a lot of complaints about the acting but i think they did the best they could with the material they were given the story is predictable and the characters are shallow and saccharine im halfway through and im really unable to care what happens to any of themtheres plenty besides the diversity to indicate this isnt trying to be a true period piece you have people whove never met doing outrageous choreographed dancing truly bizarre music for the period and side characters who must dress and act ridiculous two guys beat the crap out of each other for five minutes without a scratch okbut whimsy cant make up for the insipid scripti give it a few stars because it isnt completely unwatchable and probably fun for teenage girls
i made it to the second episode and couldnt take anymore this is garbage the acting is terrible the storyline is painful how this gets a rating over  is bewildering avoid like the plague
i was waiting years and hoping that someday somebody make a filmseries from the novels and then we got this so disappointingreadthenovel
"first i am a person of colour whose people and country were subjugated by the british empirenow while we got that out the way this show is an extreme embarrassment to all period dramas out there i understand this is all interpretive fantasy but it really is not all that much fantasy
you see the witcher is fantasy as you got magic witchcraft wizardry mythical beasts and also a heck lot of diversity but that is great it makes sense as it was an actual fantasythis is not all that fantasy it still depicts some reality in the regency era but for some reason the buck stops at a racial utopia of relatively lightskinned black and white people mixing freely what about all the many asians the latinos the middleeasterns they did not get the same freedom in herefurthermore i would be furious if i see a show set in say west africa that would show the same racial utopia or any other scene for that matteri like diversity and would anticipate such if you show new york even in the s but a little accuracy goes a long wayforced diversity is a problem you gotta write a creative story with a pretext where you can include diversity this is just lazy storytelling"
a whole episode of them getting it on and him pulling out is this what you really want to watch is this what people think up pretty messed up i can only assume people have run out of things to watch no man will enjoy this show unless his mrs gets fruity after lucky him
this is honestly the most ridiculous thing ive ever seen it is historically innacurate to be point of absurdity at one point there was even a man with dreadlocks in victorian times are they kiddingits all well and good saying its not meant to be historically accurate but its clearly meant to be set in victorian englandthe acting and accents are awful everything about this is a joke
i gave up after the third episode nothing happened far from sense  sensibility or downton abbey i give them some credit for the costumes and i guess the acting is ok
if you expect a drama period piece this isnt it so many historical inaccuracies it boggles the mind they also took modern songs and retooled them to that periods music style they insert many races into the higher ranks of society which leads one to think the woke generation could care less about society
while the queen married a dark skinned person and then created equality was a bit jarring at first i got used to it and was enjoying the show at the beginning even with the ariana grande music played by orchestra but then there was a bizarre twist where the show turned into what was essentially porn every episode had minutes soon minutes of sex the main character raped her husband he was saying no no stop but she wanted to be pregnant so she forced him to continue and this was portrayed as a good thing this was one of several women take your power trick menhonestly i never read the books but this was not a good period drama i love period dramas and this one was just bad there premise had promise but the execution was abysmal
black aristocrat tells other black aristocrat that they were integrated with white aristocracy because white king married a black chick😀😃😄😁because regency england had such a huge black population including aristocracy😃😄😁😀ha ha ha ha how weak and absurd
down to earth a bad series  waste of time and money
despite the gloss few characters are likable and the adult content was gratuitous and added nothing pity this story was left in the hands of an american
dont waste your time watching this stupid show i regret doing that do not repeat my mistake watch a boring documentary instead
i really dont want to feel that when i watch a period drama it is cast with an eye to the blm movement that apart it is poorly scripted and the acting is wooden the sets are good but theres not really much else going for it
i was soooo looking forward to season  of bridgerton but was extremely disappointed season  was excellent and surely season  would follow suit yes nope did not happen it was so boring i almost fell asleep twice this is not a good thing i am not at all interested in watching the second episode of season  why is it so different from season  definitely a disconnect and not a seamless transition into season 
it breaks my heart to see this beloved book series turned topsyturvy casting was almost a  epic fail its a bit like casting tom cruise as jack reacher
"it was the main reason why i didnt finish the first season  her annoying face sorry but she isnt that beautiful so it was funny for me from the beginning when queen called her perfectcome on
i always watch historical series to learn something but here  everything is wrong and telenovela likeno thank you"
"gorgeous lead actorcheck
lovely costumescheck
beautiful set designcheck
amusing narrationok
its basically desperate housewives in a period i wouldnt want to live in i mean they barely have indoor plumbing
if you want vapidwell perhaps thats too harsh a word but it suits the way i feel
want soft core porn set to a period soap opera this is your show
i watched as many episodes as i could stomach but i just cant get into it no matter how many friends tell me its great
its fluff
good luck to everyone watching and i hope you get what you came for im out"
surely if you are going to place a series in a time and place as the very least read a history book before hand the diversity is laughable but its not aimed at historical buffs but the acting is embarrassing the whole show is definitely a show aimed at women who are too busy to notice how bad the show really is
"a night wasted
i only save costumes claudia jessies brilliant attitude and regejean page beauty you can turn sound off if thats what interests you
downton abbey austen are you kidding"
waste of time trying to get stuck into this series i didnt connect with any of the characters and the plot made me yawn turned off before first episode ended
why bother with going up the effort for set and costume design if the actors are completely unrealistic may as well have them wearing tracksuits and trainers and fiddling with facebook on their iphones
"me while watching why was this even made
proceeds to question the sanity of some friends who said it was nice makes a mental note not to trust them ever againeven just as background noise i cringed"
you cant call something a period drama  then make it so historically inaccurate really disappointing show
as a fan of historical drama i find this very annoying to watch whether or not you can accept the concept of this being a reimagining of the georgian age for me the forced diversity still just feels for lack of a better word forced but apart from that its the rich colours that every one wears the perfectly manicured beards tresses make up the modern dialog the anachronistic music i could go onas a show itself its pretty standard fare for modern young audiences but the object here seems to be style over substance so while not dreadful for me its only watchable if you can ignore the slick pc correct production
"on the surface it has it all and so much potential
great period in history high society class fantastic costumes and then it falls flat on its a
the story has been told over and over and over again
family with many daughters important of status jealousy macho honor and poor choices
and poor choices are something that is so utterly repeated again and again that i find it unbelievable and boring
too bad  and what a waste"
if this is meant to be a parody or a joke then youve hit the mark british royalty is far from being like that its just another unreal show based on something historical the acting is horrible the plot and writing are as shallow as a saucer of tea this show has nothing to do with the ja books just another netflix nonsense
indians actresses playing british aristocrats in a regency period romancewhat next tom hiddleston playing django netflix is going to ridiculous lengths to pander to the woke snowflakes for the sake of token inclusivity
"waste of time
bad bad acting
the story is bland and the setup is unrealistic
gossip girl low cost"
look if you want a costume romp and to forget the setting this is your lot everything is so obviously an american writing on british historical society that the facts and manners are not so much ignored as put on a ship sailed out of portsmouth and roundly cannoned to the depths all the british actors on set must have been falling about between takes with laughter at the whole shebang enjoy for the story id say the crown was more historical than this flight of fancy
this is historicly not correct but instead of enjoying a movie or serie to escape everyday life and crazuness they come with this forced diversity thing it just dont make any sense it is unwatchable it is cancel culture lets cancel our history and rewrite it it makes me sick
"terrible dialog cliches galore and a lack of even a hint of detail make for a very poor period drama
saccharine sweet chick flick low rate gossip girl scripts should leave off a genre that warrants a little more pedigree and care required to handle it
alas the dumbing down of the televisual arts continues
avoid"
its not a period drama its a teenage drama with costumes terrible music too just unbearable cant finish the first episode
there i said it its vulgar sure but the show gets away with cheap vulgarity
i was looking forward to this shame i cant watch beyond the first half an hour its a load of over the top acting may be intentional even the voiceover was hurting my ears and put my teeth on edge
i was hopeful but couldnt make it through the second episode it was like an amped up cinderella thing but just really bad and using talked english history horrible
normally i enjoy netflix productions but this is sadly very poor nothing wrong in trying to update the normal period drama but this is like a poor period soap opera the characters lack any depth and the story lines are child like and over simplified to entertain the masses the netflix brief appears to be frocks cleavages but forget a coherent story line dumbing down history has been done before but not as badly as this
"wow errgh wow
i can hear the fake laughter on set oh arent we all so modern and cool so progressive as a mxed rce person i find this type of show so insulting lets put a few of my kind in to any show now any period of history  even made up to keep us happy one side of my culture can really see why people are starting to resent this type of pc drivel its everywhere just fling one of us in to prove what to keep bleeding heart woke liberals happy or people who like to wallow in self pity whilst the rest of the world laughs and shakes their heads"
"both the script and the acting are terrible i could even forgive these if at least there would have been a minimum of chemistry between the two main characters instead i kept waiting for the true love of daphne to appear
there is no attention to detail and manners to the way characters speak and behave these were essential aspects in society at the time
instead of a good romance we receive bad acting tickthebox diversity casting terrible lines and not a minimum of care for details or creating the atmosphere
i cant understand why it is rated so high i guess its just paid promotion"
i liked season one some people might say it was because of all the sex scenes or whatever i saw those as a distraction to a fairly nicely entangled piece of writing that included a diverse cast of characters with different backgrounds converging to create the perfect storm of social commentary character growth and some lighthearted fun thrown in the mix all wrapped up in a shiny fantastical edwardian or victorian veneerone of the threads i thoroughly enjoyed in the first season was the one having to do with simon and his upbringing and his consequent decision not to have any children in the thread that resulted in his entrapment and decision to leave high societyseason two replaces the intrigue with a very vanilla wooden plot to out of victorian literature not even worth watching even if youre just doing it because youre bored the only things i liked about season two were the things that i liked about season one the costuming and setting and the soundtrack
they have ruined such a great story season  is ridiculous and they ruined a wonderful storythe book and season two are completely different i cant believe the author would agree to have her wonderful love stories torn apart and made completely different
having watched    episode i can honestly say that this program is absolute garbageit would seem that the writer has read half a wikipedia page about the british monarchy smoked a load of weed and then made up some sort of rubbish story for a  year old book reportawful
looks more like the english went to uganda wasted time find some thing else
why are the characters all  years old and just now coming out and does daphne have any other face than innocently surprised
i think im correct that it is more parody than anything else or maybe its some parallel universe there is nothing believable about it so cannot carry on watching it my wife probably will though
like gossip girl meets downton abbey is that a good thing maybe for a few escapist trashy hours but like gossip girl the fun probably wears thin and it becomes a boring rehashed soapy plot that no sets and costumes can save after three or four episodes
i would understand if this series would take place in some parallel reality completely imaginary society like in hunger games or the carnival row which is copied though from something tangible almost close as uk of th century but in the very first scene the author tells us grosvenor square  so we are in the heart of good old england of the th century indeed nevertheless we see a black man with  dreadlocks on a promenade and a black queen charlotte half sitting half laying on her throne  scream of painyou might think the production tried to show that no matter the color of skin the beautiful actors and actresses may play the high british society and would be convincing which is in my option just impossible improbable ughmoving forward i was right they didnt try to do this from one conversation we learn that king george the td actually chose a black woman as his wife and improved the situation of black people in the society no wordshave anyone from the production team thought about the educational part of the television what younger generation would learn about the history and manners of this series context shame this must not be tolerated in the modern worldto sum it all up this series is a gossip girl of a distorted high society of an imaginary england of two centuries ago
any presentation of the past must be done with great care while romance as a genre has always presented life through a rose tinted lens it shouldnt skew realities beyond the sphere of its main protagonists a romance set in nazi germany for example would be in very poor taste if it were to present a history in which the holocaust didnt happen yet in a sense this is the path the makers of bridgerton choose to takewish as hard as you might but the past is the past you cant rewrite history but that doesnt stop some people trying which is what makes this appalling show so insultingtoday society is far from perfect but at least it is trying to address the mistakes of our predecessors race remains a huge issue even now in the st century but things were far worse in the times during which bridgerton is supposedly set those were dark times of slavery and oppression by the mighty british empire over anyone who wasnt anglo saxon whitebridgerton on the other hand doesnt quite see things that way it portrays a past in which societys upper classes were multi cultured echelons in which the colour of ones skin was inconsequential in fact it idealises the past to such an extent that it reaches levels we are still striving to achieve now centuries laterpresented in the modern day the story would no doubt be quite engaging it gains nothing so far as i can tell from its historical setting yet in choosing that setting the story takes second place to the raft of blatant historical faux pas the childish dialogue replete with shall and shall nots my lord and my ladys is a future effort to make the setting more believable
predictable gossip girl alike series i was hoping for something sophisticated but nope waste of time unless you are stuck at home with covid then maybe it will be a little distraction
the british high society where half the people you see are people of colour it completely ruins the immersion it screams forced from the getgo if it was completely fantasy then fine but you cant show such historical inaccuracies just to please the masses
i loved the original book series so much i really couldnt get enough when i heard netflix was taking this on as a tv adaptation i was so excited but after watching their version of the series it left me feeling disappointed and a little broken hearted the mcs that the duke and i are are based on had no chemistry which had be bored they made pretty much all of the characters unlikeable that you were supposed to love and as this is a historical romance genre it just did not have that feel to it at all theres a certain charm it needs and this show just did not have it i dont think ill be wasting my time on season  now i have to reread the book series to rid my mind of that awful show
i have read the novels and enjoyed them so when i have seen the title i was looking forward to watching the series what a disappointment besides the fact that the characters lack any chemistry the choice of actors for a historical movie based in the th century england makes the movie looking like a caricature i could not immerse into the action the story or the atmosphere because all was so over the top and fake looking this is even beyond wokeness this is incredible stupidity
the production values of the series were excellent but thats its one saving grace no doubt the diversity of the cast was designed to make viewers sit up and take notice but it was more than a little ridiculous if currently fashionable i suffer from the delusion that if a programme is to feature a historical period then it should reflect that period and not some alternate reality
its really hard to get into this show and this is someone who likes english period dramas considering all the good word of mouth id heard i think this is just really boring couldnt care less about the characters
i watched every episode in  days so it wasnt bad but no where near my top  tv shows i watched it because everyone hyped it up but i still have no idea why very predictable
this show is very wrong and i am not talkin about the diversity the show honestly that is the only part that is respectable i am talking about the language the dresses shape and colour on top of that it has mediocare writing at best this could have been done more gracefully ofcourse the idea was fine while making it reality something went horribly wrong and please do not just say a show is good because it is diverse it is very important being diverse yes try to look past the big corprations maniplations and see and hear everything not just like a show because it is a bit different when it is empty an  dimensional
"when i learned there will be a netflix series based on quinns bridgerton books i was very excited for it now after watching all episodes and it was very painful watching it i must admit im very dissapointed like some others i wasnt thrilled about very benevolent casting but lets put that sideways and focus on the transmission of the story about daphne and simon from the book to the screen
there was only very few moments which i recognized from the book im really trying to understand that netflix had to have a show and stuff but its really hard to do so because they basically ruined one of my favourire book many of the sidestoriesnot in the book originally were very unnatural to quinns vibes and very unnecessary i dont know if j quinn had any word with how this is gonna turn up but to me it feels like there is  of the book and rest is well rubbish lets face it
its hard to explain to people who have not read the books how devastated i was when i saw what theyve done to anthony and im not talking about the plot with his mistress im talking how they created this monster brother who forces his sister to marry a man she does not desire when in the book is exactly opposite
how simon and daphne told everyone their courting was just a game eventually except anthony who was the only one to know it in the books from the very beggining the situation about simon lying daphne that he cannot have children and everyting following that situation except the duel scene and the bedroom scenewhich was only partly like in the book there was everythintg wrong the complete queen storyline was absolutely unnecessary
and then few unimportant details like daphne isnt in her first season daphnes hair colour that their first second or third child is not a boy and so on and on that are some details which can be quite easily transmited to the series but for some reason they havent done that
and not to mention they told everyone who is lady whistledown right now in the books you dont know unless you figure it out on your own until the middle of the book 
i have to give some stars for beautiful locations and some acting sometimes
if you are not a fan of the books i guess you could be able to like this if you are a fan of the books there are two possibilities one is not to watch it at all and stick with the books which are so beautifully written or you can watch this and appreciate the books even more
if there is next season of this i beg creators stick to the original story it will be much better"
while i was under the impression that i was watching something somewhat related to s i was distracted a lot by the adapted versions of popular songs playing in the background plus the characters are just too superficially portrayed
i suspect anyone who enjoys this show has never read any of the books i dont understand why they needed to be so different from the brilliant books awful show political correctness gone mad rubbish ill stick to the books
yeah dont bother the whole thing gets wokidie worse as you watch it if you fancy having your viewing spoilt with lecturing on wokisim then this is for you
"awful dribble for the viewers who found this tripe appealing and sexy must be the one or two who also was easily pleased with fifty shades of grey dreadful
a pantomime mockeryit was like going to watch a school play"
i agree with the other reviewer the story choppy the characters cardboard cutouts and some of the acting very bad the actors are not acting its a flat recitation they do not belong to this time period the  plot forget it
everyone has some money they come and invest money in the movie industry for someone and earn money art and message are missinga good essay on the conditions and rights of men and women at that time that is all good selection of beautiful actors and good coloring and telling jane eyre stories and feminism of the game what has this got to do with peoples current lives
"im totally fine with the diversity of the cast but the storyline is boring and unoriginal the worst shows are the predictable ones and this has every cliche in the book just throw them all in the soup and it makes a good meal no
its pride and prejudice meets gossip girl each of which are great on their own but weve all been there done that even during a pandemic this does not challenge or entertain"
for the first few minutes i was wondering if it were a spoof but i found i was wrong 
put me to sleep in first minsseriously what where the thinking  the cast to writing to acting everythings seems misplaced
the show is very beautifully filmed and the costumes look amazing it starts out in line and tone with most period dramas however the dialogue is not a smooth and well written then it just goes on to get annoying and even laughablei watched it over christmas with my sister and we agreed that rarely had we ever rooted so little for a film couple both of whom are also quite unlikeable characters literally all the girl ever talks about is marriage and the guy as it turns out has the worst excuse in the world for not wanting to be a father moreover they are terribly ill suited for each otherit feels like  shades of grey dressed up in regency style  mind you im also not a fan of that movie  with the same terrible dialogue to followi doubt i will be coming back for a season two i think i will rewatch the new version of vanity fair which hardly got any mention but was ten times better than this show
please do not watch this as a historical event this is just another boring soap opera that is based on real people but complete made up storiesand the performances are so awful the costumes loks like plastic omg
its a waste of time theres literally no subject in it i watched all of it hoping to see an action or a serious subject in it the main idea is that she doesnt know what happens between a husband and a wife no one told her when she got married how this process happens and the whole season is about her figuring out what it is like seriously waste of time each episode is  mins and literally nothing in it but stupidity
"there were so many assaults on my historical intelligence i watched the whole series due to covid isolationthink the turkish telenovelas are much more worth watching
i knew the series was bad after the first episode but kept watching hoping it would get better dont bother to watch even if youre bored"
disney and merchantivory have had a love child guaranteed to fill you with self loathing as you binge it to the end
seriously poor script poor acting implausible characters clumsy plots this shambles could be used as an example of what not to do for aspiring screen writers actors and casting directors this is dumbing down in the extreme avoid
and thats for the gorgeous costumes the series writing is so bad it could be entered into a write an awful parody in the style of jane austen
this show was a little entertaining and the directors obviously wanted to show us that they got rid of racism by choosing black actors but first of all why not include more poc races and if youre going to get rid of racism why not get rid of misogyny bigotism and classism
not for me i managed  mins just way too corny if i get really bored i might give it another go  maybe
initially i loved the show loved season one i was a huge fan of the books first benedicts book and francescas book being my favorites but season two absolutely killed the show for me and now theyre going out of book order  colins story next the only thing season two had in common with anthonys book were the characters first names the entire plot was completely different not to mention the fact that were still hanging onto marina a character who is briefly mentioned in the books in passing another story ruined by netflix and shondaland i hope and pray that netflix never picks up sarah j maass acotar series
i have read many of julia quinns books and loved them i also love romance regency  historical fiction this show was in no way accurate to the time era it was written for if youre gonna have a show set in this era you better make sure its accurately portrayed
this show is like a british version of gossip girl at first its fun to watch then it just became eh i do not think this is worth the fuss really it is just me though some really enjoyed this series
bridgerton has all the ingredients of a relaxing and comfortably predictable soap operaas a teenager i often watched sunset beach after school and a practical thing was that the storyline went in circles in such a way that it didnt matter if you missed one or three episodes you could allways catch up on the story anyway bridgerton works exactly like this another likeness is that it is engaging enough but the acting is forced and you never truly forget that you are looking at actors in a studio the dialogue is heavy with old fashioned expressions but is neither very clever or funnythe biggest disappointment is the costume and scenographythe actors have heavy modern make up and wear costume jewellery from the s and forward combined with an endless display of boooring dresses most of exactly the same cut such a waste of tailoring worksome environments are clearly proper historical venues and it is very obvious when the story moves into studio environments outdoor scenes are just ridiculously fakeall in all if you have some hours to kill bridgerton is a fairly enjoyable alternative but i wish all this money had been spent on a script a director and a costume designer with skill and originality
bridgerton is a mediocre rendition of the domestic novels that established the likes of jane austen to the helm of fictional writing in the late th and th century womens obsession with marriage  marrying into a financially sound family  marks the primary theme of bridgerton obviously the agencies available to women in the period were rare and a good marriage sadly was what they considered as a secure retreat from the brutalities if the world bridgerton picks up this theme but fails to establish a connection with the viewers as the characters are largely mechanical and hammy too in parts their emotions are hardly palpable and some parts are so uncharacteristic of the era its set in the protagonist daphne bridgerton is no elizabeth bennett or elinor dashwood or emma woodhouse she is one note and without actually caring for her the smoothbreezy screenplay just permits us to flow with her you do not feel her awe or her joy or her troubles as you feel deeply how elizabeth is in a dilemma  joy and shock  during her visit to mr darcys family estate pemberleywhat salvages the show is that the narrative never bores theres enough colour and celebrations and light hearted romance to keep you engaged through the running time the show looks beautiful but we have seen better in downtown abbey the costumes though are at times just too eye popping instead of being eye pleasing and who gave them the idea of playing girls like you in the background for a show set in   its such a put offyou may give it a try and flow with the tide but dont expect anything concrete its entertaining but fragile with emotions
for me it wasnt about skin but about beloved heroines from the book i was expecting some familiar vibes but no we have foolish anthony simon and od course daphne we have younger but plain mrs danbury and oh no mean stupid penelope my favorites
this show was so annoying the costumes were horrible it looked so low budget daphne was the worst her dresses and jewelry looked like what a kid would wear her bangs were horrendous and i cant figure out the point of whatever they were doing with her eyebrows everyone else had sculpted brows so its not like they were trying to be historically accurate and it was plain distracting looking at her face and although all the costumes werent great everyone elses dresses were much better than hers were they intentionally trying to make her the most unattractive person on the show eloise might tie for distractingly hideous dresses but apart from it the costumes looking cheap the acting and the dialogue was so boring i mean it was a real struggle to keep watching it i dont even want to blame the acting maybe it was the script i was so excited as i love period pieces and it looked like it was going to be campy and fun i will be shocked if they actually make a second season i wont be watching
i will start by saying that the diversity of the show is great i appreciate it as far as the show itself its trash another generic soap opera that lacks a true plot or actual story the costumes are even horrible and cheap looking avoid at all costs
i managed to watch  minutes of the first season and as much as i was attracted by the gorgeous decorations and dresses the historical inaccuracies were annoying
bad so very very bad the plot is corny and derivative
if youre expecting to see something on a par with masterpiece theatre or even downton abbey you will be sadly disappointed dont waste your time this is a big step down for the genre a dumbing down actually quite silly altogether  stars is very generous i give that much for the actors and crews good intentions and efforts
in only watched  minutes and i could not watch more it caught my attention since i like history and i like timeperiod dramas but just  mins into this show and i was just annoyed at the bad acting and inaccuracies i know its fictional but even then its just not good i dont understand how this show has a  when ive read other reviews saying the same thing that im saying it sucks and you will be disappointed
poor acting  empty story meaningless plot daphnie is so annoying to look at and simon is just unrealistic 
"the plot is so different from the original it is almost
unrecognizable the names of the characters are the same but thats about all why adapt a book for the screen and change it almost completelythis production is an insult to julia quinns writing"
the first season was amazing and although there were changes from the books i felt that those were good changes for an onscreen adaptation however with this season the changes made little to no sense there were many things that were added that convoluted the overall story i believe that they wanted to create more conflict in this season but unfortunately it added nothing to the story the things that were removed would have pulled the story together i would say this season doesnt hold a candle to season  and i hope that they do not make the same mistakes with the next
a typical american production of an american book supposedly about regency england
why do we continue to recreate history and take away the relevance of the time equality is not sustainable
how can you made a tv show in and exact historical time by being so inaccurate in the th century in england black people were queens and nobles chinese were in the queens court how could they ever have printed and sparkling fabric costumes if a white actor interprets martin luther king or a chinese emperor wouldnt you be disgusted by it seriously how
it is kind of like gossip girl but more cliché with a lot of cultural appropriation added
a good one to have on in the background while youre doing something elsereally predictable and cheesyseason  two main leads initially hate each other but then realise theyre madly in loveseason  two main leads initially hate each other but then realise theyre madly in love
based on a series of victorian romance novels bridgerton follows a classic love at first site and troubles to follow tale in the fashionable high society of london big houses fancy dress and many a balls and dances this show definitely deserves its emmy win for period andor character hairstyling the sets and costuming were fantastic and they definitely took liberties with historical accuracy in a way that i think worked out for them but only due to the soaplike nature of the show it ended up feeling like a well produced period hallmark series with a major subplot surrounding a  year old who doesnt yet know where babies come from if you like romance series this definitely was one just not the type of show for me
no historical accuracy in clothes to begin with the women in the show wear really tight corsets but none of them except lady featherington wear dresses to highlight their waists in season  daphne raped simon but they just normalised it and moved on so i wasnt planning on watching s but ive been told that it was better than the first one i surprised with the amount of chemistry the leads had im gonna be honest the first  episodes i was a fan of the chemistry but after anthony and edwinas wedding i couldnt ship kate and anthony anymore i was just bored of them and started to root for edwina instead and the last episodes didnt change my mind about them i didnt feel any kind of happiness when they got together or kissed or had sex i just felt bad for edwina and when anthony rescued kate when she fell off the horse it felt really cliché and like a fairytale this whole show feels like that anyways you cant be excited at any moment because youre so certain that the leads will end up together no matter what thats why its so boring and makes you feel all empty the ending was anything but satisfactory
if you like sex on screenthis is for you if you dont care about historical accuracythis is for you but if you want intelligent programsthis isnt for you how about we make more dramas about african cultures and periods of history instead of something that never happened it is insulting people will watch a jane austinish show with black charactersbut not a show about true black culture come on hollywoodif you want diversityshow it in the subject matter not in garbage like this
there are couple of wealthy families constantly having costume parties and trying to impress each other with their posh accents to be fair i have no interest in th century british society life maybe thats why i found this so boring and pointless to watch there are some jokes involved but i dont get it only good thing about this show is inclusivity of people from different backgrounds although its historically not accurate for that day and age i cannot say anything about acting of the actors and actresses as not sure if they were supposed to act bad anyways its over for me after  episodes
"i guess they tried to compensate the hollowness of it all with sex scenes poor writers tend to do that when they cannot come up with anything else more enticing
but even if we excuse the amount of sex scenes that add nothing to the plot and honestly even cheapen the show the rest of the story is horrid
they make a god awful attempt at portraying the struggles of being a woman back at that time only to present a bunch of girls and women that actually have pretty good lives with no worries even eloise who tries to represent the need of women to take a different course doesnt actually do a single thing for herself
as to daphne and simons relationship i only have one thing to say ewwwhonestly just a show about a bunch of rich people going to each others houses and having no real concerns in life just the thought that this show is set during the napoleonic wars era which gave way to tolstoys war and peace is an insult"
i dont know who thought its a good idea to make this series it was so strange to watch this fake historyand theres no real story behind this
hey ladies looking for the next gossip girl or  shades of gray tell everyone you love jane austin but really you hardly ever read because books are so boring get confused about whether something is good or not just because you like the look of the male lead in it then youll love new bridgerton its absolute nonsense but it has a dreamy man and is very romantic in a totallyunbelievableyetentirelypredictable sort of wayfor everyone else its best avoided because its so hammed and cringeworthy youll gnaw your own fist off before episode  has finished utter dross
"the choice of black actors was at least interesting is that a problem not really in a perfect world people would be bothered by the lack of black actors in period adaptations and would try to understand why perhaps that would solve some issues in todays society yes we live in a world that is still racist dont be so shocked
what was not that interesting was the breaking of customs it denies the history more than the presence of black actors i am confused by the need to integrate the society of the st century into the th century but was it enough to make the show a disaster again no
now lets talk about what really makes it a disaster the books
when bridgertons rights were acquired it wasnt the big hype or the large amount of books sold around the world that were bought it was the story and thats where the production failed miserably
bridgerton is about family its about mutual support and love a lot of love
each character is an important part in the construction of this family somewhat eccentric for the time but still functional and highly respected in society
the production gave us none of this it turned the books into a reality show
it delivered a foolish anthony nothing like the responsible man that are always concerned about his family that we see in the books his story with the opera singer was shameful to watch it completely destroyed his character in exchange for nothing anthony is a libertine yes but leaving the family aside to be with his mistress wanting to introduce her to the society act like a passionate and jealous man when everyone who has read the books knows that romantic love doesnt interest him for personal reasons completely hateful
violet did not show herself as the loving and respected mother colin was not the charming gentleman lady danbury was not the sarcastic and rude woman that everyone loves to hate a complete change of personalities
that was the real problem of the show the lack of fidelity to the book and its characters
i dont care if the show is going to be portrayed on mars in the year  full of romantic alien couples but when you say youre going to adapt the story of a book do it do not create a new story this is not your role the author already done that
thats what i expected from netflix and shondaland
if you havent read the books or even if you have read it and liked the adaptation very good for you really you dont have to agree with me
but if you read the books and didnt like it like me lets just hope that the second season will be more faithful and brings out the best of the characters"
"the acting is so weak and the characters are so shallow good looking people with zero talent every main character has an overused lines with most predictable romance ending i preferred the supporting characters such as penelope anthony and ofcourse eloise
i wasted hrs in this cliche series"
about any of the characters this might be the first show where by the finale i dont like or care about any character in the show someone go help these writers
if you wanted to colorize my history i guess you did an amazing job africans me indians leading high society is a bigger joke than white people in china or taking over the entirety of africa during the same time period this show is more offensive than anything thats come out in the last  years and that includes the cartoon of dumbo shonda rhymes is a disgusting joke and should be shunned
i got rid of netflix i was willing to give them a nd chance after the obama fiasco but this sent me over the cancellation edge
pathetic  while it is great to have a racially inclusive cast and show a world where people of colour are equal as a white person but that doesnt mean you falter everywhere else be it the writing  acting or the sheer idea of the series only good thing about the series is duke hastings dhapne is unbearable and so are the other giggling females
colourblind casting puts the whole project down the drain its just disgusting
this show is hard to watch ive tried  times to watch the first episode and couldnt tolerate it
i genuinely loved reading the book series and was very excited when i heard about the adaptation i just finished watching the st episode and while it is obviously a lavish production i am not pleased with the changes in the way the characters act and behave im not talking about the unique casting  all of the actors are talented and beautiful to look at what displeases me is the apparent changes to the actual characters they do not speak act or behave like the characters in the books the names are the same the setting is the same the plot premise is pretty much the same but i am very put off by the changes in the actions and speech of the screen characters opposed to the print characters upon which they were based beautiful costumes beautiful set beautiful people lousy adaptation
im a big fan of julia quinn i read all the books in the bridgerton series and liked most of them so clearly thats why i hated this at one point i wanted a screen adaptation of these books i still do  from someone else who wont destroy the storyline im so sick of modern issues being forced into historical settings and when its done so poorly its doubly offensive
"with the socalled success of bridgerton netflix will soon be rewriting history with films based on if jfk had livedif abe lincoln hadnt gone to fords theater if the titanic hadnt sunk and if slavery hadnt happened
complete garbage"
i was never a fan of shonda rhimes how to get away with murder was probably the only show i could tolerate mainly because of viola davis i should have taken that as a sign that i wouldnt enjoy this show i did watch it though and it sucked im a history buff and movies such as the favorite are what i would enjoy watching but this show is just boring and irritating the characters are all shallow they are unlikable the acting is meh storyline is ridiculously predictable they are better shows out there
the novels were horrific to begin with and terrible examples of historical fiction to boot why anyone would want to make them into a television show fantasy or not  and lets be real bridgerton is pure fantasy without a drop of history  is beyond melet me be clear my issue is not with the lack of historical accuracy its pure fantasy and acknowledges itself as such no its just poor storytelling which is much worse i watched half of one episode out of a combination of boredom and masochistic curiosity i regret to say thats time i will never get back
id heard so much about bridgerton that despite my lack of enthusiasm for period drama i decided to give it a go diversity current music whispers sex i was expecting something groundbreaking and exciting alas it was a complete snooze fest same old rubbish women desperately seeking men to feel validated some swooning and fainting for good measure falling for the bad boy and not much else i understand that marriage would have been important at that time but when theyve clearly tried hard to add a modern twist to the period genre why not use it to actually say something all attentionseeking surfacelevel rubbish with no substance  abandoned after a couple of eps
i honestly dont see why people get excited about this show terrible writing terrible acting and the sets well consider that displays of candle lights are obviously displays of electrical christmas lights and youd have the gist of the vibei reckon a show like this digests well for someone coming home from highschool and thirsty for pulp but if you want some quality television for your evening i recommend to steer clear of this
the british georgianregency queen with an afro oh and the writing directing and acting is of the very worst shame
first season was ok main male character very much based on austens most famous male character the diversity dressing and most of the actors were nice second season was terrible nothing of any sense turned out to happen very disappointing the sharma eldest sister could have been performed by a much better actress her performance was too weak the plot left much to be desired very disappointing indeed
this was embarrassing to the black community to history and to tv acting is almost adequate class situation was absurd history was rewritten poorly
"the storyline was very plain and not surprising i could see they try to incorporate diversity but it ended up with disrespecting history and making the setting contradictory for one thing they decided to stick to the historical background but for the other they decided not to it is ok to change them but if they do they should have made sure that it was well constructed
i also wanted to know about the characters and culture at this era in depth the struggles women had at this era didnt really speak to me"
historical inaccuracies is big with me i once turned off a historical movie because he didnt look like the main character i get it its a fantasy but common now cant we try to get it a little historically accurate even guy richie gets it a little and he has queen playing in the back ground of a knights tale lol
"i saw the trailer and costume review and i was curious not terribly interested but i knew i had to read the books first i think the majority of book readers transforming into tv series watchers had the benefit of having time to forget the plot i had no time and i was devastated by thisi stopped after  minutes to point out that i hate the costumes the set design and the hairi loved the diverse casting and i was uncaring for the modern songs i was quite open to viewing this not critiquing the race historical accuracy or not the embellished colours of costumes and the set designs i just decided to put them all into a basket named it was an artistic choice and as such i viewed this series as being set in a fantasy realmso my review will not touch on those  points at all
but i will focus on the hair that could have been helped it was a delightful and charming scene with which the book opened and it was this elaborate joke whistledown shared that it was funny how all bridgerton siblings resembled each other and in no way their blond mother even in those  first minutes i mourned the clever writing of quinn they just decided to abolishand onto the characters themselvesviolet every single encounter with violet in the book or even if she was just talked about by her children you just knew she was loved in the first ballroom scene we already know how funny she is but in this series shes just a wallpaper the only semblance of a great matriarch she is was shown in this one scene showing her love for her dead husbandanthony in the first book he shone you just had an itching to get to the second book to have him get a happy ending to see what he does he was charming supportive a beautiful soul through and through in this series i just hate him more with every single episode it felt like there was no connection to the family and i just dont think that he deserves a story in this tv series universe at all and by making the glue of the family being the opposite the whole family has lost any appealbenedict i think that we cant get him any kind of magical story if any good points are already released in this first season he fell in love on first sight and sophie was marked as being special when the bridgertons remarked that benedict was noone of consequence and sophie let it slip that he draws she was a servant who knew him better than his family at this point theres no need for his story at all it will just be cheapcolin i have not a lot to say except for that it just twists the dagger in my heart whenever hes on screen hes uninteresting bland and simple when in fact he was supposed to be a charming traveller who did not know his place in the world of accomplishd siblings until he got together with penelopedaphne she was supposed to be on her third season firmly heading to spinsterhood beautiful but nothing special and the best of the best friends firmly in the friend zone of all the marriageable men and her first encounter with simon was supposed to show how down to earth she was by dealing with a dimwitted but kind suitor i really dislike how they dealt with nigel here everything in this series makes her uninteresting and whineyeloise frankly nothing bad to say kind of even enjoyed her smoking habits i guess shes the reason i didnt rate this lower  and maybe proof that i dont need and an adaptation  shes very unlike the character in the book but at least shes faithful to the spirit of herpenelope her story is completely ruined here and i dont a see a way back to her wonderfully sweet personality even the fathers presence who was most definitely dead in the book ruins the whistledown storyline i just hope that this gets cancelled and we dont see how the story writers will butcher her upmarina her presence quite ruins eloises future story as she was supposed to be bridgerton cousin i just dont understand why story writers had felt the need to squeeze as many book contents into this one season
lady danbury she was witty shrewd and in no way connected to simons childhood developments her presence here was a breath of fresh air in terms of everything else being bland but nothing actually interestingsimon his whole story arc was relatable because you could hear his thoughts and why he actually broke through the stammer lady danburys involvement made it boring and cheap simon was supposed to get over his stammer because he was smarter than everyone and stubbornfeels like the writers decided to get rid of any comedic and worthwhile things to portray and just decided to take and fill it up with new characters that dont change the outcome and make you mad insteadprince and queen if they had been wonderfully written and would add to the story instead of detract id be all for them but whyso if youve bared with me till this end
i hate this i can accept differences in characters and storylines but dont make them all worse than the original and in spite of all that i wanted to drop this so many times starting at the nd minute of the series that must be a record or something
and id say dont trust the  and  reviews this tv series doesnt require any sort of extreme rating it is horrible in its blandness alone"
"i wish i could give this a  star rating but unfortunately the plataform does not allow it
quite honest i didnt expect much from the beginning but it blew my mind how bad something with such high budget can be
from mediocre acting to a poorly developed romance this serie is a complete waste of time unless you enjoy fantasy romance without any true passion
there is absolutely nothing regency there except de similar silliuete in the clothing and i say similar because they are not regency gowns and some of them looked cheap
the ost was pop music on violin didnt go well with the ambiant or dances or nothing for a matter of fact the cgi façades made me laugh a little it kinda felt like age of empires
the characters were the classic f boy that falls for the delicate and pure lady the femist that does not represents feminism at all the clueless chubby ginger that lives romance throught someone else the gossip old lady a queen that looks more like the tree in childrens play she does absolutely nothing and a whole lot of other characters that you can easily forget the names or that they even exist
i tried my best to finish this and not drop it but i felt a total waste of time i could forgive a lot if they played it like a true fantasy not giving exact location and date but they did and it was just bad
if you want to watch good historical romances there is a lot of good options going from the crown harlots the tudors downtown abbey and the great
if you crave fantasy go watch disney live actions like cinderella or maleficent but if you want something more spicy even outlander might be a better option
for me the best thing about this series is that it have an end and i still cant believe they are going to squeeze a second season out of it if you really liked it you do you this is just my most sincere opinion"
why rewrite history to placate the ego of a special interest group the casting choices are so far from reality it actually turns my stomach why not use puppets or talking animals instead  at least then it would have interesting charm and originality
"it would be good to actually see a colour blind casted movie or tv series that was not based on complete drivel the source material for this was bad enough then made worse by removing all semblance of writing im disappointed because if the script is well written and inspired then colour blind casting will work until someone in a position to commission has the guts to do this though this kind of show will only continue to reinforce the stupid idea that it cannot be done
if you are looking for complete fantasy light fluff with half naked people then this might be for you if not it is best avoided"
"so after debating whether to watch the edgy bridgerton on netflix i did
some may see the full color cast and i applaud their modernization of an old classic but please dont miss the subtext
the black girl gets pregnant out of wedlock and yes of course the black duke is absent his father bravo netflix and thank you for perpetuating another stereotype of old society lets not forget that these factual disparities plagued upon the black race was forced and families broken up purposely to perpetuate a cycle of poverty and strifei refuse to watch anymore after episode   minutes in
as a man with a daughter living under my roof and fully supported by her mother and i this makes me ashamed of those who still write scripts this way and act as if theyre preaching solidarity or equality"
although i love period dramas english chinese literally any i could not like the main leads of this series the plot is also underwhelming that is not to say i did not enjoy the show i enjoyed the supporting cast very much adored the costumes the lovely voice acting  julie andrews the cast did an excellent job and the music is wonderful having said that i simply could not bring myself to like daphne and simon this was prior to the part where daphne sexploits her husband by guilttripping him into having a child i was absolutely mortified not by the act alone but by the rubbish that she spewed after that there is far too much sex in this show without much substance daphnes character did not grow she is simpleminded and selfish wanting only to marry an affluent husband love she claims hah and to bear children simon is no better being a vengeful manchild who makes a vow that he ultimately does not keep yet they are both praised by all and sold by the tv producers and writers as the most esteemed bachelorbachelorette though the setting carried an austenesque feel it left me wanting and huge gaps that i feel will never be fulfilled in subsequent seasons eloises personality seemed more to my liking and in the beginning seemed like she would redeem the show but the actress came across as rather annoying and that really put me off my favourite is lady danbury she was an absolute thrill to watch and honestly the only reason anyone should watch this showin contrast to another reviewers comment i may be asian and one would think i would support the diverse cast i do not though i can see past colour some of the actors are no doubt great at their roles and i would certainly not have it any other way it is a little irritating that this has become such a big deal in casting and producers feel a need to hire people from all backgrounds personally i would have liked retaining a white cast for no other reason than the fact that it would be more historically accurate just think about how ridiculous it would look to have a historical chinese drama with  white guys in the background inclusivity is one thing inclusivity and compromising authenticity is anotherps i have not read the book and if the book is anything like the show i will probably never touch it all i know is julia quinn wrote it and played a huge role in the casting and production of this series
i get this is not an accurate historical drama i can get over that fine my biggest problem is the two main characters daphne is so dumb like she really didnt know how babies are made and simons vow was stupid how about just be a better dad than yours was the fact that daphne didnt know what the pullout method was and had to ask her made weeks into the marriage really had my eyes rolling i guess she was sheltered but this is just ridiculous a simple conversation between these two wouldve saved us eight long episodes
i canti dont know where to start the stupid premise the idiotic plots the characters speaking in jamiacanmun accents of the english upper class the effusive costumeswhats the point if you liked this twaddle theres no hope for you
bridgertonseason bridgerton based on a series of books by julia quinn details the life of british high society during the summer of  while the characters of king george and queen charlotte are based on historical fact the rest are inventions by the authorthe audience gets to watch the bridgerton familys oldest daughter daphne work to land herself a husband in the meantime her younger sister eloise chastises the system for turning women into horses or cattle made only to produce children it is appalling to be sure but the series brings forth nothing but trashy romance tropes made to excite the audience i found it enjoyable as most people did but it still must be pointed out how bad the writing truly isin order to move the plot along especially in a time period where secrets were closely maintained to avoid scandal lady whistledown is invented as deus ex machina this is a pseudonym to conceal her true identity so the gossip can continue to be spread amongst the city this literary method can be effective when used properly but it is the sole impetus to continue the series it was not difficult to guess her true identity but this proves problematic for the audience because then her presence is no longer as excitingi also have a problem with the use of todays popular music being used at the balls performed by stringed instruments it is very distracting regardless as humorous as it isim being very harsh on this series especially since i said i like it but there are hundreds of period pieces out there that handle the subject matter better the war of  isnt even mentioned the king regent isnt even mentioned i felt like i was watching a middle school play where modern themes were explored with a random backdrop used and worst of all there is zero character development with but one message that i did enjoywhile men could do as they pleased and women could not rare appearances of love did occur daphne and simon whose plot line is as ridiculous as the rest did get a moment worth mentioning love is not an emotion love is complex and is the sum of many different emotions but the notion that love suddenly begins with no end has been romanticized for far too long daphnes mother reminds her that love is a choice a person has imperfections qualities that are not ideal traits that could be infuriating but to choose to love is to accept all facets i was quite pleased to see that idea put forth when trashy romance tends to ignore it
i havent read the books that this series is supposedly based on but why should we really care how faithful the adaptation is shouldnt the production sink or swim on its own merits and all this discussion about whether its appropriate to have people of different races playing historical figures in the case of this production i think discussions of race feminism and historical accuracy deflect from the fact that it is boring if you enjoy watching the same over and over again ad nauseum tune in its a photocopy of almost every pbs period piece ive ever seen and photocopy in the sense that its not quite as good as the originals and there is certainly nothing original about this story the acting is okay  i doubt netflix will garner any emmy or golden globe acting nominations from bridgerton costume or cinematography nominations sure why not really all i can say about bridgerton is meh
why cant historical accuracy be enough people who are writing this crap know that it will be taken at face value and the majority of people will never go beyond movie watching and will take this for historical fact which it is not anywhere close to being accurate for heavens sake half the actors do not even try to use an english accent and most walk like they came off a subway the jokes are stupid and the dialogue is horrendous you have taken the one genre that was at least truthful for the most part and completely ruined it for amateur history buffs like myself small differences to make a story enjoyable are great but do not take actual human beings and events and pass them off as accurate history when the majority of what you are showing is inaccurate there is fiction for that complete trash even the costumes are horrendous
that regency london was so ethnically diverse apart from that which was laughable it was an entertaining way to spend christmas day afternoon after a hectic lead up to the day and a tummy full of food ive certainly watched far worse and frequently sadly
costumes are great the sets are perfectly lush but i really dont care for the writing the acting or the pacing people screaming for historical accuracy need to get over themselves
brilliant staging and production value but with story that take  episodes to establish more than one plotline and a complete season where the costume department was told to give every character away there was no intrigue or mystery thats right  the lead characters are eyecandy while everyone is gaudily portrait as meanspirited with gross overstated costumes the only thing we learn from this alternative period shlock is that unlikeable characters have no dress sense a complete yawnfest clearly executed in the wrong hands in the hands of the someone like the itv or bbc this would have been talked about for years
i tried to watch bridgerton twice the first time i only got through half an episode after a friend told me she really liked it i tried again and pushed through to the third episode but i couldnt go on this show is just so boring nothing happens in the episodes the characters arent interesting and the drama if you can call it that is so cliché not good
having read all the books the viscount was my favourite so my expectations were high how disappointed i was i appreciate that sometimes there is a need to change aspects for the tv element which i understand but this version has totally killled the writing of the book and spoilt the frameangst that was felt in the writing of the story i was so looking forward to this being portrayed into tvscreen and sat aimlessly for hours waiting and hoping it had been delivered to be sadly disappointedwhy do producersdirectors feel the need to change such amazing writingstories just to get their versions out there i am most annoyed at the writers for letting their stories be manipulated for i dont know greedmoney or public exposure
so much talk my head hurts and nothing happens in the first three episodes one would think the viscount is more fun the little wannabe wifey is beyond annoying with her singsong voice and facial expressions music is nothing like in the first season i might have watched it only for that
pride and prejudice meets gossip girl and fifty shades of grey the scenery costumes and decor are excellent though
"lets be honest im not the intended target i find regency romances tendency to ignore history for the sake of sexy intrigue to be tiring bridgerton while nothing new or unique gossip girl meets georgian era is fine actually the episodes carry you along all right even if you know exactly whats going to happen the cast is skilled and i appreciate that the casting  while not colorblind  is at least diverse its not in anyway special and to anyone with a critical mind it isnt much more than suitable background noiseentertainment while you do something elsebut i cannot abide eloise you cannot cast a yearold woman as a child and make it believable every time she does something young i cant help but laugh its so unbelievable the actress im sure is talented but she cannot be seen as anything other than a grown woman she has a deep voice a mature face and has done a fantastic job in other mature roleswhat were they thinking
its so bad
it ruins even what little the show had to offer"
"it is time for blm and i do pay respect for this slogan
but în  at the royal court of england the queen ladies lords to be afroamericans it is too much
so i took it as being a comedy
a childish one however"
i love regency costume british dramas but this was absolutely absurd beyond belief its basically regency for twilight fans not that i have even watched that either but i can get the gist and similarities i couldnt even force myself past  episodes of this drivel bore fest and absurd and unnecessary but the tiktok generation is eating it up apparently to hell with history and good writing or scripts just write smut and stick a regency dress on it and call it a day add a black queen and now youre woke so even more bonus points yeahits definitely not for me and really a disservice to the era and the genre
"i love films and tv shows in period settings but i didnt find this show one bit interesting for several reasons we got the feeling that we were not watching a true depiction of the world at the time it was supposed to be set
we eally lost interest when we realised the soundtrack was orchestral versions of current pop songs"
this is drama drabble that is not even close to a english period piece the americanism spin and pcness ooze from this series it is unworthy of even finishing the first episode
first of all the show is said to set against the backdrop of regencyera england considering the fact the regency era lasted until  and slavery in england was only abolished in  there is no way there is a black person in the topclass noble society the fact that the show makes the main character a black person is obviously a way for the director to showcase their political opinion while throwing away all the historical facts this show is just another typical example of ignoring the slavery past and inventing own fantasies for the sake of making profits
"another dem gem from netflix
a bunch of politically correct and progressist fantasies packed in a poorly acted mtv level trashy show"
many historical contradictions and inaccuraciespolitical correctness at all costs  fear of going against the tideplot holes
i was very disappointed i was truly excited to see a sort of modernized version of theme of this story but the characters are empty costumes are hideous the dialogue is completely unexciting clearly the writers of this series do not understand how a drama is supposed to be written you dont give away all the secrets in the first season i have no reason to watch a second season if it happens all the other poor reviews are bang on no need to beat a dead series
review is for season  historically inaccurate to the last detail🙄 i love history so couldnt bear it while watching this show one must suspend reality this series is supposed to be  years back when there were hardly any inter racial marriages let alone even inter mixing in society  white wedding dresses was not the norm this became popular only after queen victoria wore it at her wedding because white was her favorite color  then it was a marketing strategy to label it as virginal white in later decadesit would have been better if they could actually show interracial marriages while actually talking about how it was perceived in society then would have made more sense to understand how things have evolved since then
if you can sit through twenty minutes of this and not feel abused intellectually then you may well have been lobotomised in your sleep
"the characters are so boring and predictable so is the plot
cringey and a waste of time"
took me  minutes to conclude it was not a comedy not to say it that i found it funny but it seemed so over the top that there was no way it was to be taken seriously well it seems i was wrong the acting seems relatively solid as is the costumes and the cinematography unfortunately it does not work at all
superficial childish and boring characters are fake and unrealistic storyline is predictable and boring
"its a shame to see beautiful looking productions with lots of resources to take advantage and tell stories that are full of stupid drama for the simple reason to keep people watching 
entertainment seems to have become cheap problem making of a story with hero characters driven in agony by selfish actions"
most of the characters had potential but theyre bogged down by an incredibly boring drawn out story certain plot points border on innovative for the historical romance genre and then step back from the edge right before they cross over into something interesting every character with any originality was criminally under utilized or turned into a shallow jane austen clone by the end overall they couldve cut at least  episodes out and several sub plots that went nowhere really the only truly good thing i can say about this show is that golda rosheuvals turn as queen charlotte was absolutely excellentif you like looking at attractive people acting out tired trashy romance tropes for  hours this is for you if you want satisfying story telling skip it
just awful its for brainless people who dont have common sense about the history
if the show hadnt deviated so far from the book it wouldve been more enjoyable it started out promising adding layers and color and a bit more substance to the first half of the book it was based on then started throwing in random characters and plots that had nothing to do with it marina colin falling in love when he actively avoided marriage until his own book which was the fourth in the series the absurd scenes with the queen when she was never even mentioned in seven books and multiple second epilogues of the series turning mrs featherington into a villain who locks women in their rooms and threatens them horrendousanthony being the most unlikable character and nothing like his literary counterpart trying to arrange his sisters life without her opinions making you hate him from the first few episodes all in an excuse to show that daphne is a strong modern woman a better story wouldve shown that she is that with a supportive and loving brother at her side the way we know her to be but the further destroyed his character by creating an obsession with his mistress that wouldve had bookanthony rolling his eyes in absurdity why should we be excited about season  when theyve done everything to ruin the leading mans character anthony bridgerton was the head of the family but let his mother make most of the important decisions for his sisters while he focused on making sure they were provided for and making sure the familys reputation was impeccable because anything less than that would harm his younger siblings he liked women but felt strongly about none  even when he decided to marry it was for the good of the family and not because he wanted a significant attachment to any person netflixanthony shares nothing with him except the same hair color the idea that he would invite his mistress to his sisters ball so ridiculous i nearly fell out of my seat he never wouldve embarrassed his mother that way or ruined his other sisters chances at good marriagesand the second reason the series is so disappointing we didnt spend anytime with the bridgertons most of the storylines aside from daphne and simon revolves around the featheringtonsmarina and their household we barely got a glimpse at bridgerton house or the dynamics of the family violet seemed to be pulled along by the wave of her family instead of setting the tone and being the strong and capable widow she is in the books they cut out the best storylines they had in front of them with the family interacting with each other and taking the humor out of the story in favor of gambling plots boxing matches the queens appearances an unwanted pregnancy and unmasking lady whistledown which shouldve stayed in its place with book  where it belongs its like they ripped the book in half used what they wanted and then created an entirely new endingand now for daphne and simon these two are wonderful together their chemistry is great they look fabulous when sharing the screen and when they were given good material to work with they sell it its clear the casting choices were impeccable knowing that these two would need to lead season  its a shame they didnt put that focus on the rest of the cast its like they didnt expect there to be a season  since they obviously didnt want anyone interested beyond daphne and simon the bridgerton brothers are supposed to carry the next three stories  how can these particular brothers do that when viewers hate them how can they not see that they brought simon to life and left the others to be caricatures the brothers all look tiny when theyre supposed to be large men they couldve cast three actors who had as much charisma and looks as simon instead they look like short little boys looking up to see his face when they should be imposing and staring eye to eye with simon not a head shorter and scrawnythe sisters were all annoying and didnt fit the looks  francesca is supposed to be the most beautiful yet the one tiny glimpse of her and she looks like she would be better cast as penelopeand the ending what glimpse we had of daphne and simon at the end again barely stayed close to their story simon telling her they would live separately where was daphne going back to london simon showing up at her mothers house only to be hilariously put down by her butler the pregnancy he thought was truth his agony when he realizes how much he loves her and is scared for her safety and realizes how much he wants a child the bridgerton brothers showing up at hastings house only to be forcibly removed by their mother in one of the funniest scenes in the series but its okay the sex scenes are frequent so dont worry about keeping the tone and humor insert eye roll here and making their first child a boy when they first had three girls  theres nothing like hitting that strong feminist statement home like wiping out the existence of three girls to give simon his heir at least they mentioned that the name should start with a even though their first son was david in the bookthey did three things perfectly the costumes were fantastic the casting of simon and daphne couldnt have been better and getting julie andrews to narrate  she was impeccablethey shouldve bought the use of julia quinns characters called the show featherington and considered it a spinoff of the books
"a clever experiment where they fed all the bronte and austin books to an ai from the last decade to see if it could churn out a passable period drama
fascinating to see the output but the technology isnt quite there yet it seems suprised they made it into a series without proofreading it"
more leftist woke nonsense from netflix well who would have guessed this has nothing to do with the history except wthat characters wear some old fashion clothes
a genre that i dont likeand i hate those who cant stand what they call a woke agendaisnt it a tad weird though that all of a sudden half the nobles in england are people of colour  nicely inclusive with ann boylenn in black recently who knows last time i checked the black american princess coudnt cut it when was it it  two years ago its a past tense soapopera but still wrong on so many levels cindarella is more realistic in the age of the windsors or the crown
honestly i do not unserstand the hype about this show its damn lame
the second season doesnt even remotely have the magic of the first the only good thing is kathony jonny and simone have great chemistry and saved the season from total failure i dont know what to talk about the supposed love trianglethe attempt to make edwina be a victimand by the way edwina violet and lady d are not at all reminiscent of the characters in the books the plot of the featheringtons took up too much screen time and the bridgertons who the series should really be about were sidelined i cant stand seeing the queen wanting to know who lady whistledown is anymore disappointing frustrating annoying
i do not have a problem with diversity or that this series does not align perfectly with history but my problem is that it is a period piece and while they did not hold to truth on the race of aristocrats  you should expect this when it is a shondaland production think hamilton  the issue is they held true on the language used and the seriously deep misogyny it is almost every line and well the very theme of the series of events that take place to show the eligible women off to marry a wealthy mani cannot watch much more of this so far im at  minutes and im very disappointedrule of thumb for me with all that is out there to watch or even rewatch and might i add read as well there is no shortage of entertainment at  minutes my attention should have been grabbed rather i picked up my ipad to bang out a note of warning over my complete disappointment with this seriesunless you are a huge fan of period pieces flat acting misogynistic themes a woman better get married or suffer the life of a spinster after she went and ruined herself ugh and as ive seen from the other reviews if you are able to overcome the racial diversity that was not even remotely true again think hamilton  then be my guestbut for me there is enough oppression out there for women without having to slog through eight minute episodes reminding us how poorly women were and are still treatedfor me this is a solid pass
i am sorry but this is just not right dont get me wrong  i like the story the twists and the actors performances but although we are living in a demanding society expecting from everyone to respect the norms and cover all of the requirements can you imagine brad pitt as nelson mandela well i cant history is history and i dont think we should mock or interpret differently the facts
i just cant believe that it dares to have over  rating since its stuffed with mediocre actors cheap costumes and plot full with nothing but cliches i dont know why a serie that would best suit for yearolds would have this much nudity on them one of the worst series i have yet to seen sad and pathetic
tedious intangible and disorientating woke fiction is the best way to sum up the show netflix have literally cashed in on a socialpolitical movement and nothing more theyve done something right for all the wrong reasons
"so daphne who the queen chose to be the diamond of the first water based on her beauty and composure who is white is then established as by the queen as the most eligible bachelorette then a black lady appears and suddenly everyone wants her and nobody wants the white girl on the opposite spectrum a mysterious black man appears and because he is black he is the most eligible bachelor automatically and everyone wants him it is not until they come to an agreement with each other to appear as an item that this black man adds value to this white woman who was otherwise without value without him shame on you netflix pure wokism white hate white guilt white privilege all of facade all fake news meanwhile black worship pure wokism at
its worst"
the serie  was enjoyable to watch even with history being messed up the seris two is so disappointed i cant even watch it one tries so hard to adapt at the characters and this illusion but no  its is so poorly written directedperformed when you think the main character is gay and the other one does belong to illusion it doesnt seem to stick in my brain i guess they should send it to space to show it to aliens cause maybe they dont know history sexual orientation etc sometimes when someone tries hard to shove their opinions in you it will be a fiasco honesty and truth will always rein in history which by the way left the chat in these series
season  was a bit of fun the plot is more or less true to julia quinns book the leads are extremely attractive and eloise and penelope are wonderful overall  quirky and lacking subtlety but entertainingseason  is not much fun at all more like painful the plot drags on and on and on as we see the same scenes repeated ad nauseam lots of almost embracing with lots more heavy breathing over and over pained expressions and anguished conversations  about the same exact things over and over amateurish direction and cringeworthy camera work every dance every clinch or nearclinch gives us yet another  degree shot over and over even the costumes lack imaginationthey look like they were designed by a twenty year old fashion school dropoutthe plot of season  was stretched paper thin over  episodes when all of the story would have been so much better told in  why did they not combine two novels into one season why did they not hire decent writers directors and designerslets hope improvements are made before tackling the next season
absolute garbage in every sense of the word i am forced to write a review of at least  characters but have nothing else to say so trash trash trash
i wonder how long will they make such useless drama even new age generation kids know that such romance set wrong examples the relationship between main characters is out right wrong they fake it and then fall for each other are we living in st century acting is aweful and stupid this got  and all the hype grow up netflix people  stop watching this s
"would be great to not to have in our past what we have but simply rewriting history wont change it
if they would say thats sf show about alternative history thats okay
but what they showing in this so called historical drama or period drama is simply pure lie"
what rubbish not worth spending time on this kitsch its not funny not charming not interesting
wait a minute what am i seeing hereafrican women in regency period aristocracy that cant be rightin fact its not right as the only black people in england at that time were sailors coming and going or some freed slaves it would be a decent show if it was more historically accurate
utter and absolute nonsense there is no black royalty in the uk during the  century stop distorting history animals terrible show awful writing shocking allowance from the studio
pc casting of african americans in roles not historically accurate for the time but everybody wants to re write history how about making a movie about african tribes and cast some white and mexican dudes in tribal roles ok show but that is lame on the pc casting
its the type of thing that you want to hope is a tongue in cheek parody or a comedy but it doesnt wink enough to let you know that it is so the worry is its a teen melodrama trying to take itself seriouslynot enough good bits from the book are in the show nd some of the divergences fail to improve eitherdont mind a diverse cast in an unrealistic setting personally but once thats done by still keeping the pomp and circumstance as well as the classism and sexism aspects all still in place makes it obviously jarringthe opportunity would have been to subvert all of that surely once one of those fabrics was removed tell a new and different story more obviously tongue in cheek and more loosely based on the storyis more similar to reign a dreadful loosely historical teen drama but one that at least is selfknowing about that fact and plays up to it than other things that once they did one twist it could have beenpride  prejudice and zombies would have been a better inspiration in how to set up the world building of nonaccurate or loosely accurate history
historically incorrect unpleasant cringe oh and i cant use the vomiting emoji thanks to imdb
horrible and wish i never wasted my time saw the whole season hoping it would get better nope will not be returning to this one
god this is boring if there was anything decent on normal tv that wasnt a repeat then i definitely would not be sat watching this cringey tripe wife seems to be enjoying though
the voice over is annoying and the worst  minutes ever seen of a show
the whole cleverness and intensity of the show was lost to me i felt like the characters didnt keep there personality as last season and there was an off feeling and disconnect for entire  episodes i think most of us didnt understand or feel the love between antony and kate ethier considering he was going after her little sister for so long sense we are completely done with simon and daphne now are we just going to go sibling by sibling with love affairs id also say its confusing how daphne and simons moment where the kissed in the garden was the turing point for the entire show but in season  there affair is considerably less of a problem for the society there was multiple things that just didnt fit or make sense to me i was so excited for this season because of how good last season was and im very sad to say it was a very big let down
this is enourmously insane and unrealistic casting and story line that this is like star track but in costumes has  relation with any historical happening but sadly these series alter how people think about histrory at least in science fiction you know what it is this is like trying to say very realistically that they sky is green
decided to watch this with my wife to see what all the fuss was about its weirdly inconsistent in tone on the one hand a regency drama that suggests comparisons to austen but on the other a cheesy modernhistorical romance story in the bodice ripping traditionthe story line is ludicrously predictable  unrealistic much of the time the writing is sloppy  the acting very uneven its hard to take any of the characters seriously enough to care about them of the two leads daphne dynevor is mesmerizingly pretty  does a good job of investing the often stilted script with some life regéjean page is also mesmerizingly pretty but his acting is painfully wooden  perhaps partly a consequence of the scant attention paid to the development of his or any of the male characters i suppose this reversal of the usual situation is one of the things that makes bridgerton interesting  but its not enough to make it worth watching
i give it  stars for the costumes and color the utter banal plot and pointlessness of it all is bewildering
i read the first bridgerton novel some years ago and loved it filing in the funbutshallow bodice ripper category i was kind of surprised to see it was being made into a series  i think there are others more worthy of being made into a production but i was excited to see it nonetheless i really wish i could have enjoyed this series as a unique experience but instead i couldnt help but compare it constantly to the book imo it falls short in capturing the essence of the original story the fun and light hearted banter between daphne and simon the passion the develops with them is much greater and while its never feasible to get an entire book into a series the shows producer adds unnecessary and distracting elements with the historically inaccurate casting using current pop music and i dont understand the motivation to change some of the important plot lines and scenes from the story so if youre not a historical fiction purist andor havent read the book  youll probably love it also people please dont insult jane austen by suggesting this is anything like her exceptional works even the book is nowhere in her league
i have no problem with actors being from different ethnicities that do not match the traditional set up if the show had good writing it would pull you in more the regency england setting in the show is kind of a joke so much so that it is a distraction the lead actress has zero appeal i thought some of the supporting cast where great actors overall as some people have mentioned this rewriting of history is very fashionable at the moment it would have been cool if they came up with a entirely made up world that the same characters inhabited it would have added more intrigue i am confused how this show is getting so much praise it is really is a stinker
"i went in blind and very quickly figured out its a fantasy ok
if the writers and producers went to all this trouble to make something never seen before then they must commit to their ideasso put some black people in royalty positions ok you have my attention but what are you going to do with this unique situation these creators chose to do nothing everything in the writing has been done a million times no chemistry between anyone on camera no compelling dramathis series with its inclusive casting and colorful costumes missed its chance to do something fun by taking itself too seriously hard pass"
its hard for me to imagine that there are actually people who really like this season  was mediocre and predictable which you often see in romantic stories but surely there can be some tension and unpredictability in it so not in this show and i understand that this is based on a book series which i do not intend to read given the genre the stories will be just as boring as this series because season  is even worse than season  its terribly boring and cringy but most of all very awkward its so unbelievably awkward that i just fastforwarded parts to get through it this seasons theme was again predictable opposites drama only this time at the expense of edwina main character kates own sister which she just cheated without respect into going with her own sisters fiance because shes so selfish and of course everyone in the series already saw that kate and anthony could not stay away from each other but the worthless writers found it necessary to spread this over  episodes with the standard cliche that selfish kate gets away with her horrific behavior without any consequence and her sister immediately forgives her as if nothing happened only lord jack featherington came off badly because hes a white man welcome to hollywood
i so wanted to like this i love all things jane austen and thought this would be up my alley it has all the scenery accents and costumes of a period piece but it has no soul whatsoever i dont know if the acting is terrible or the writing maybe both but i couldnt make it through one episode its like watching highbrow robots dont waste your time
i agree that its totally ok to rewrite history with diversity i also have no preset notion of whether it was true to the books but the writing and directing make this feel like a c level hallmark movie i dont blame the actors but the director has purposely gone for what is a very presentational style of acting like on a sitcom each piece of dialogue is performed almost to camera as if each actor is doing a monologue their movements are really big like theatrical plays and this removes any emotional resonance or historical accuracy for me having been addicted to british period dramas for years its the tightness the emotional understatement of people in society at that time and the characters desperate to break out of it thats whats compelling to me this has none of that which to me is the only thing that makes it fall short of its status as a historical dramaim super sad this didnt work out super super sad i think shonda rimes is a genius and i absolutely crave seeing talented black actors just a shame glad its a hit for shonda and company because it flips the finger at all the white male executives who have throttled ideas like this for decades
there were no afro nor asian in that time in england its a fact get your things straight
did not enjoy at all dont understand how this fits in the regency period at all as it doesnt
amazed this shallow rubbish seems to be at all popular appears to be poor jane austen fan fiction and cosplay by people who have only seen bad film versions latched on to the most superficial aspects and missed all the interesting bits the narrative device of a printed scandalsheet to explain what is going on seems the final unsubtle insult to an audience assumed to be too thick to pick up any subtlety whatsoever
if it wasnt for the fact that weve got a refuse workers strike id happily put this in the bin dont watch i hear you cry i wasnt but the wife was bingewatching while i listen to an audiobook of the day of the triffids this mixed race period drama stuff just doesnt work
in the times before video when we read books there was a genre called bodice rippers this is the visual equivalent it bears no resemblance to what conditions might have been in that era features a variety of situations that would have been improbable to say the least and panders to the current trend of multicultural inclusion in denial of history watch it for heaving bosoms and sexual titillation otherwise ignore it
" star for the costumes i loved them some pretty dresses indeed simon is handsome and i liked penelopes character
i have to edit my previous  star to 
i didnt like daphne from the beginning she seemed like a spoiled child  but when she accuses simon to lie to her about not being able to give children i had enough
simon clearly says he cannot give her children so he cannot marry her she insisted on the marriage anyway
the story itselfnothing is happening i keep waiting for something worthwile but now
even pretty little liars were better than this gossip girl had some good conversation some exciting plots
this ill finish it as i dont like unfinished stuff but i definitely wasted my day"
absolutely terrible negative stars watched a few episodes thinking it would get better and i want my time back i get the fictitious aspect of this i get that its not supposed to be historically accurate however it wasnt entertaining the whole reason i even gave this a go was to be entertained the weird sex scenes that came out of nowhere did it for me i was like nah i love real historical dramas fiction or non fiction but this is a cheap joke the costumes and hair were so ill made it felt rushed and lacked attention to detail that i love about the regency period all i could do was stare at the horrible wig applications throughout especially daphnes im sorry to jane austen for witnessing this from her grave and what is up with daphnes lack of facial expressions she is a beautiful young woman but like move your face nope this aint it netflix try harder this better not be the reason you got rid of the office
this is a modern social drama in thin disguise as a regency drama the dialogue is vulgar and unsubtle the behaviour is quite careless of propriety protocol and credibility it has high production values and its lush opulence and modern narrative pacing has some attraction so of all the stars it loses if one hoped for austen like depths or even disney charm it regains a couple as modern entertainment social dramas need an intelligent script and engaging characters i am sorry the production invested so much but not in the writers
"i read the books i liked the books i have some gripes but this isnt a book review i didnt like the series good source material was turned into a flimsy cliché in my view a cheap american view of regency england
the actors were well cast i have no issue with them i liked the diversity the myth about queen charlottes ancestry was a good ploy to introduce them although why were the asian characters odd given the large british colonial presence in asia but the scenario ugh i get it reading is not the same as viewing but seriously there were so many redundant scenes and some were to short leaving the viewer wondering about why certain things had happened where a good story teller would show more than tell important points were made in a few almost offhand sentences for example why simon and daphne decided to team up or the reason behind simon not wanting children not wellexecuted at all and what was the plot around baron featherington about it was not in the book and completely unnecessary and it was hastily and vaguely ended that time could have been better spent in filling in issues like the ones i pointed out before all in all most of the main characters came off far less likeable and far more shallow and fickle than in the book and thats not down to the acting but completely down to the scenario and probably the directingso many anachronisms unnecessary and completely going against main plot points ladies at boxing matches theyd immediately lost their reputations and be ruined an idiotic choice from the scenarist because it completely goes against the character of daphne protected naive sheltered
the costumes soooo over the top and not in a good way it was distracting the costumes of the bridgertons came of drab and cheap against those of the featheringtons quite a contrast to the book lady feathingtons waistline tightlacing maids in uniform and silly little caps and capes all victorian and there were so many more victorian anachronisms cigarettes safety matches glass milk bottles dance cards zipper on boots earstuds whistling kettles mutton chops gymnast in stilettos etc fascinators instead of bonnets during everyday life moments no less something that doesnt even happen nowadays
and the music is it too much to ask for the musicians and the music to be in accordance string music but we see flutists the dancing to be in synch with the rhythm of the song and strauss really much later
so much of this could be easily avoided its an insult to the viewer and in my view to the original author hardly any anachronisms there
also these anachronisms are even more strange when its evident that they try to be to be accurate to the period in other aspects like some oldfashioned idioms and language make up your mind alreadyyes maybe im too critical but having read the books i know it all could have been so much better and so much more sympathetically done yes the books are escapist fluff but not that fluffy"
i suppose people think that watching something in costume somehow qualifies as high art this depressing mess of cliche certainly proves that it does notthe writing is utterly banal dialogue is drab with the only concession to period language being an absence of contractions i cannot agree he does not love you the acting is wooden and the actors and all seem just a little too pleased with themselves but theyre beautiful so i suppose thats enoughits depressing that once again britain is portrayed simply through the guise of crinoline and wigs
its a harlequin novel its a harlequin novel it has a big budget and some trendyedgy choices that try to hide it but in its soul its a harlequin novelk now you know exactly what to expect plot writing romance and characterwisethey stuck some modern day glittery gunk on it to make it more appealing to a younger audience who might be in denial about liking the same historicalromancenovel guilty pleasure as the  crowd and to make it seem like more than it isexpect things like garish modern fabrics in the costumes explicit and plentiful sex scenes and harp versions of ariana grande songs playing at the balls and the diversity cast everyone is gushing over is tailormade to distract the  crowd who would otherwise quibble about the traditional patriarchal romances im not buying it if they were doing true hamilton casting rules wth are the asians where are the hispanics either have an actually diverse cast like in the personal history of david copperfield or stick with a historically accurate oneyoull either find the modern touches fun or deeply grating on your soul if a knights tale bothered the bejeesus out of you avoid this if you thought reign level costuming and historical accuracy wonderful youll be fine i somewhat feel a more accurate setting would let one appreciate the full junkfood romance of this better since it would remove the posturing and trying to be edgy and relevant and let it be what it is a harlequin novelas for book series accuracy id say its about as close to the books as the ella enchanted film is to its source material which is to say not really and set in a different world book fans you have been warnedi wouldnt watch this with other people its the screen version of thattimeofthemonth chocolate intended to be consumed solo shamefacedly and voraciously once others are out of the room
i watched only the first episode and it was enough for me i love history and historic movies or documentaries but this historic drama is a joke a very bad taste oneeven outlander was more historically accurate and it didnt claim to be an historical drama but a fantasy movie if bridgeton would have been set in our time reinterpreting history like william shakespeares romeo  juliet  it would have been so much better but set in xix century and showing a diversity that never existed at that time see queen charlotte its not just ridiculous and historical inaccurate but even dangerousyoung people not knowing the real history might think that racism never existed because look in xix century england coloured people were in the nobility royalty evenwhat slavery what discrimination this never existed because history is recreatedunfortunately is not just one movie i think that is a new direction that cinematography takes they did it with les misérables with javert the police officer in xix century france as a coloured man if we want to rise awareness about racism and discrimination i am afraid that this is not the right way to do it this will just give the false idea that in xix century everything was right and fair while in reality england and france were trading slavesits like wiping off a painful but necessary to know part of the coloured people history
every time i see historically inaccurate portrayal of anything before th century it just totally ruins it for me the moment i saw black nobility i turned it off i understand the desire to put black lgbtq or strong women into every movie or show but at least try to keep it historically accurate
"it is good more weak performances and could be better and if you have a  season that fix the mistakes
personality changes i didnt need because in the books they were very good and even better than presented in the seriesmaybe if i had never read the books and saw how just inspired by the books i wouldnt have expected anything much better and in the essence of the books"
switched it off half way through the first episode
i am a fan of this series for season  but season  definitely failed to keep up the same expectation we did not get the love story that we were promised as there was definitely no chemistry between the two main leads this time certainly some of the side characters grabbed our attention but not adding anything more to the main story could have been made much better
"nothing can be more appaling than a storyline depicting the drug incuded california beach side vulgarity like the sex in the city or so moulded into a tale of old british societies in the name of gossip and poor taste
customs and sensibilities diluted to potray the new american belief of twisted depravities as nuances of freedom by disney actors in frilled clothes is horrendous
we know netflix takes it obligation to peddle the poison of left liberal philosophy in its every show but
defecating on history showing the peerage as met gala is going a step too far even for them"
"pretty much what youd expect from a shonda rhimes appropriation of bbc period pieces jane austin or vanity fair dont come looking for developed characters or plot its focused on setting up meaningless drama bad characters are bad good characters are good troubled characters are mostly wallowing for broodings sake the writing is a hair above fan fiction
not my thing but if you find her other shows comfort tv then youll probably find a lot of the same elements here with more elaborate costumes not everything has to please the critics"
"this is a review only for season i am trying to stick it through the first season cause i hope the second will be betterthe lack of historical accuracy is appallingfrom what i see its probably maintained in the books as well probably neither the author nor the director nor the script writer gave a flying  for historical accuracyi really dont mind the mixed cast as much but everything else  the costumes are made of syntetic fabrics that i am pretty sure didnt exist in this era some of the dialogues are honestly unbelievable some of the characters act in a way that is even more unbelievable say eloise smoking alone outside at night and wearing her hair down and disorderly at all times the queen being openly interested in matches and intrigue the dances are implausible for highsociety balls aristocratic ladies attending boxing with wagers i could go on and on
also the male lead definitely doesnt give off the vibe of a wanted bachelor and the chemistry is seriously lackingthe plot is weak shallow and predictable i really hope season  is better which is why im giving the show a chance"
stilted monologues and typical historical romance book genre girl meets bad boy girl convinces said bad boy into marriage slight problems then they live happily ever after if id known it was from a book and read the book blurb i would never have watched it
i love diversity black people are gorgeousbut this piece did not represent true accurate history and history cannot be rewritten to represent what you wish it to represent without taking away from the history that we all experienced and that brought us to the presentwas hard to watch because of thisi wish they had stated truthfullyfiction when representing this piece to be honestthen i could have watched it knowing that it was honest
script dialogues cast costumes are so wrong its beyond ridiculous
i finished it just to satisfy my curiosity as to whether anything would feel satisfying by the end but nothing did only side characters got what they really wanted or needed and the main ones were just romance tropes that idiotically misunderstood one another when they werent screwing one another is softcore just expected in all series now yawn something about the pacing and style felt wrong  like random cards from different decks had been shuffled together to play poker it felt like baz luhrmann was ordered to write and direct a jane austen novel that he really hated i think it would have worked better had the world been entirely fictionalized it was very jarring that the precarious position of people of color in society was brought up in once instance but then never entered into any other detail of the story the story felt untrue to itself and so i was disappointed overall
i gave it a  for production values there is nothing else good about this showacting is whatever there isnt much material to act anywaysthe series has  episodes per season and the episodes are all alike the same dialogues and story stretched over considerable screen timeas the title of the review says it is extemely boring to follow through with any attention throughout the entire seasonsthe diversity however unlikely for the period of time i guess it is a creative choice it is fiction after all but there is morality attached to it with consequences for which todays woke culture is blind i will not take it as a minus as it is irrelevant to the quality of the show
oh dear here we go againmiscast characters divorced from any historical authenticityto cater for the woke movement they should have cast chris rock as king of england at least hes funny
what utter garbage terrible stories nonsense people probably believe this was based on reality this show sums up the low standard of shows these days netflix are setting a low after a low they are no better than starz who are the lowest but this comes closewhat utter garbage terrible stories nonsense people probably believe this was based on reality this show sums up the low standard of shows these days netflix are setting a low after a low they are no better than starz who are the lowest but this comes closewhat utter garbage terrible stories nonsense people probably believe this was based on reality this show sums up the low standard of shows these days netflix are setting a low after a low they are no better than starz who are the lowest but this comes close
this show is part of the netflix obama  million retainer and it shows lots of fictional history and historical rewrites to suite the woke and diversity driven mob its an epic fail
as another reviewer said  teen drama in period costumethis is so full of historical wholes it may as well be part of the curriculumthe language the class inaccuracies the dialogue and social graces all seem to be inaccurateanyone that expectes this to be anything like a bbc period frame will be greatly disappointedif your looking for a little distraction and fun then watch it as it is amusing
give me my time back dont watch this series because it is waste time awful awful awful
ok it definitely pushes sociohistoric boundaries which could have been interesting but come on  awful script and awful acting felt like a mix of twilight and gossipgirl with the unnecessary and weird gossiping just cheapened the whole thing it could have worked as a comedy with all the pomposity instead of trying to pull it off as something dramatic i had a good laugh
absurd missrepresentation all for the sake of a drooling ignorant mass media fed wokesphere audience
first sat down to this and was amazed just how ott the pc brigade had been in this some worked like the duke and the queen but the others were certainly not cast for their acting skills the main characters were distinctly unlikeable however the duke simon was quite tasty to the eye as was the rather attractive anthony the only characters i actually liked were the aforementioned anthony eloise who was actually a revelation and i rejoiced every time she was on screen and simons guardian what annoyed me most however was the obvious lack of screen chemistry between the  central characters
"seriously id expect this type of show from americans not the british everything about the series is nothing new to me i have seen countless stories like this show and honestly am bored no mystery intrigue nothing at all to keep me interested only character worth watching is the girl who prefers to live her life rather than obsess about marriage i dont think they handled race well in the show i think we all know what black went through then why sugarcoat it and make it seem like white people and black people then saw themselves as equal in england am black but id prefer they made it how it really was in that era it was weird seeing how black people was represented in the show
another thing i like about the show is the cinematography whoever did all those background scenes and finding such beautiful locations deserve a grammy i was more interested on how beautiful the town is than the story itself"
same old boy meets girl and they marry not enough secrets intrigue wondering what was gonna happen next just not a edge seater anyone can figure this boy meets girl out movie never a real struggle for them to be together to easymost british movies have u trying figure what happens intriquing shocking gull of family secrets not told thru story but discovered little by little and truly are secrets just didnt meet my expectations sorry thanks
"i sat back looking forward to a new series on tv
the first seen was great and from there it went down hill
a totally mixed up show that im was so relieved to find wasnt made by any brit
as a review from earliercrap"
"this show is basically one of those romance drivel novels in  episodes form if you are the type who like those dollar romance novels or movies like  shades then this is the show for you
im sure the show would be popular among girls who seeks romance and empowerment thats not rooted in reality ie  lb girl who never threw a punch before knocking out a man with one blow
besides the forbidden romance archetype thats been over done the show really doesnt have anything of value to offer no the sexual and racial politics arent anything radically insightful they are just there to fit the palate of the current sjw trends and extremely predictable beyond the sjw politics the acting was blasé and the chemistry was tepid ive seen b rated softcores more exciting than what this show has to offer a positive is that the costumes sets and production values are pretty high"
the books were sooooo much better i dont understand the need to change from the stories written in the book series while i would not have minded stories added it was just such a disappointment to not see the series played out as written my ratings was a  as i didnt shut it off but i found myself finding distractions as it just wasnt nearly as magical
i dont get the hype around thisi felt uncomfortable and bored watching this the whole thing was bizarre and the whole romance around simon was meh
i loved the accessories worn by women who needed a different dress for each event the pushed up squeezed into dresses  i loved the fabrics i loved the three sons hair i loved how tortured souls is touched upon by ignorant people who feel they are worldly when theyve never gone farther than  miles from their fishbowlswhat as writers choice is to create characters with one dimension  annoying was the constant dehumanizing of each other the control in the story that flows as obsession for the naive arrogant characters the main character daphne while young is character who controls through the guise of love i was astounded when she rapes her husband thinking this is quite fine because she in her mind thinks she is justified well well why was this glossed over by the writersi love nicola coughlan two stones over weight as one sister declares and as a result will not find a husband my goodness she was lovely in the story great actress i think the actors did a great job in the roles characters they are given you can only stretch as a craft in a one dimensional rolewatch for the fashion watch for the great acting and societal lessons of nativity perhaps from the writers perspective but dont watch to see an indepth moving series of quality writing
why is it that when faced with a bad production so many will attack with the accusation of bad acting the acting in bridgerton is more than adequate and far from the worst this production has to offer the cinematography lighting and general set design also all hold up reasonably well but the direction is clearly suspect and the script if only this script had been directed as a blazingly farcical parody bridgerton might have something to offer beyond an embarrassment of the period genre i look forward to the mstk treatment only then will bridgerton have found its proper venue
or jane austen for the massesi love shonda i do not begrudge that woman one iota of her success she has earned it and rightfully so but her work seems to focus on lowestcommondenominator projects to appeal to the masses bridgerton is no differentdeeply onedimensional stereotypical characters the chubby girl the mean girls the rake the sycophantic and useless father the overbearing mother and the dewyeyed ingenue the black pregnant teen profoundly unlikeable characters ostentatious and far too smug for its own good look at us they chirped from the sidelines we can modernize a bonnet dramaeven the absolute worst adaptations of any austen or bronte novel is far far superior than this humourless charmless soulless drivel ive seen telenovelas that were far more entertaining when the first episode ended with the synchronized dancing and fireworks i was done while i was happy to see the ethnically diverse cast it felt forced and awkward i nearly went into a diabetic coma just watching the first episode insulting and pretentious ugh
"i started watching and started laughing
i started laughing ans stopped watching"
predictable and boring love story did not enjoy watching it at one point i got so bored that staying on the phone resulted more interesting i must recognise that the acting and the costumes where excellent but the story itself wasnt that great overall it was kind of acceptable
this whole season is ridiculousthe acting it terrible from too many of the cast overexaggerated and generally uncomfortable the whole timeavoid avoid avoid
i absolutely do not understand at all what the crew were thinking or trying to do when they were creating this awful series this series should never have been created this series was really confusing and disappointing and did not make any sense at all the storyline throughout this entire series was very poor and weak and had absolutely no direction at all the cast selection throughout this entire series was absolutely poor and weak and could have been a lot better and stronger they did not at all commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters there was not any sign at all of real chemistry throughout this entire series between the cast members
gorgeous production but weak acting and dull scripting also prurient and salacious unnecessarily
very netflix very slick and flashy very inconsequential
the male lead is given an elaborate back story poor little rich boy narrative mother dies at childbirth cold distant father lonely upbringing etc the actor playing the lead is witless and bland an untalented cheesy fabio wannabe yet the leading lady who has a very thin backstory shines through in every scene she is the real star here i cannot fathom why the creators decided to promote the series using the cheesy leading man as the supposed star the leading lady must be so miserable she does manage to put on a brave face in the interviews a testament to her great acting
if you like cliché shows with no depth this is the perfect show
producers of historical fiction should have a morale responsibility to portray historical periods as accurately as possible otherwise our children and young people who may never have studied the dramatised time period will be taught wild inaccuracies about our pastthey will believe this american woke version of regency england is as portrayed so wrong on all levelswhat could have been another racier downton abbey is now so cringeworthy its embarrassing and thats not mentioning the dreadful writing and acting
love it how this thing bursts onto the scene all guns ablazing capturing the audience in the whirl of the latest event of the season not one of the actors seems to give a crap about before dragging it off kicking and screaming into the shallow yet deeply terrifying abyss that is beyond the scene scoop the poopstrictly for actual children and politically correct fanatics aka snowflakes
i get it the director and writer had an idea great but lets present this as a fantasy not some reimagining of a period piece stardust for example was a terrific fantasy set as a of period piece this however is just ignorant and indulgent of the some fantasy that exists only in the the writers ignorant addled head make the setting outer sloblovia and the time out of time and stop with the cultural appropriation of the th century english aristocracy
i have nothing against anachronisms or historical inaccuracy and am not bothered by the prospect of nudity and was even quite excited about the diverse casting none of those things are particularly problematic in this series at least for methe biggest problem is the writing it is as if it has been written by a teenager and one with no sense of style or humour clunky cringey and just plain dullthe acting is also pretty iffy
bridgerton is a solid  out of the acting is often way over the top and constantly had me in fits of laughter when i was supposed to feel sympathy or anger the costume and set design is wildly inaccurate as is the casting on the casting im not saying that a person needs to be a dead ringer for the historical figure theyre portraying but they should at least in some way reassemble that person none of the actors look in anyway like the real people queen anne is the worst offender basically this is pride and prejudice with far less effort made to look the period its set in more incredibly over the top acting and a far less interesting plot something i never thought i would be able to say
visually stunning over acting and ridiculously racially inclusivetry and make a show original this seems like another regurgitated period piece with an award teeny racial spinit seems as though creativity is dead
if you can get past the fact that bridgerton is not a historically accurate authentic period drama but indeed a work of fiction depicting regency london you may find it pleasingthe plot is a bit underwhelming and wholly predictable but i did enjoy the whole lady whistledown element which did add something original the arianda grande taylor swift quartet was not appreciated to to begin with but then i actually warmed to it and in the end thought it was rather clever my favourite character is eloise witty sarcastic opinionated bright and curious there is plenty of scope for her character to grow and be developed i also enjoyed the backdrop of georgian baththe diversity felt all wrong is it to be considered diverse with only a black and white cast if you are going to go down that road of diverse casting which clearly was the aim then it needs to be done with some actual ermdiversity
i watched the first episode last winter cuz of all the hype and was like mm no thanks then my cousin said i needed to watch the rest so i did yesterday it was not fun the main characters are irritating and the sex scenes not hot as popularly claimed writing and plot weird confounding and not satisfying a few of the more sideline charactersboxing guy and his wife and eloisewere much more compelling there was a gay side plot that was interesting and pretty well done but barely touched upon besides that i strongly disliked the whole viewing experience
it cant decide what it wants to be there is no consistency in the rules of the world that theyve created its so loosely nowhere near to being historically accurate that its actually confusing i very much enjoyed the diversity in the cast which i think is a great way to be historically inaccurate but loose the bonds of misogyny god so old the only tune it seemed too many tropes and cliches also way more sex than i expected
ill admit i didnt make it through the st episode of the st season the narration reminded me of gossip girl though the series caters to the same teenage audience i would probably be fascinated watching this as a thgraderbesides being an eyecandy i enjoyed the scenery costumes and architecture the content is pretentiousvery alá the dialogues seem staged and the overall plot as of the st episode is frankly boring and very obvious
"i started watching this after all the popularity it was given on the internet first episode i seriously wanted to abandon after  minutes but then i decided to give it a chance
the characters are overacting the fake english accent of some actors is unbearable the gossip girl of the s is just weird i would have preferred if there was no narrator
the show simply portrais shallow empty and superficial valuesi think it would have been more interesting if eloise was the main character and so the show would have portaited an ambitious girl in the s who just wanted more in life than a husband to marry a family and children just ugh"
this serie is an absolute ridiculous  it is a poorly produced and futile comedy
you cant do a book based movie for a specific time in the history and interpret the history so wrongly how can you make the queen of england black just disappointed with all the confusions in this movie and it could of become a really good movie
i started off the show thinking whaaaat and then realized it was half in spoof or fantasy got over my dislike of episode one with that scene in the first  mins  and tried it again i do love the clothes hair styles balls stately homes some interesting characters and plot developments but it started to be downright silly after awhile totally unbelievable and nothing like real period dramas i normally love too much thrown in there of the love scenes after several of those scenes and each more detailed than the last more and more nudity and the lovers getting it on everywhere and anywhere was seriously was thinking how embarrassing for the lead actors but they signed up and obviously were ok to do it and many viewers seem to like this show i gave up finally not sure i will go back to it the whole story is starting to seem too stupid and trashy to finish out season 
while bridgerton has captivated a vast audience with its vibrant portrayal of regencyera england its not without its faultshistorical inaccuracies bridgerton in its quest to provide a modern twist on the regency period has taken significant liberties with historical facts the shows depiction of certain events and societal norms often strays from accuracy opting for drama over authenticity for instance the portrayal of queen charlottes role in governance is exaggerated for narrative effect despite the fact that she did not rule in king georges stead moreover the series includes anachronistic elements such as modern language and music which while entertaining further detach the show from its historical rootsoveremphasis on costumes the series costume design though visually stunning has been a point of contention for its historical inaccuracy the use of bright colors and lavish embellishments while appealing to the eye does not align with the more subdued fashion of the actual regency era this choice while contributing to the shows unique aesthetic can be seen as a distraction from the narrative and a misrepresentation of the periods true stylescript deviation from the books adaptations often require changes from their source material however bridgerton has made alterations that one may argue detract from the original storys charm the series has introduced new characters and subplots that were not present in julia quinns novels in addition there was the decision to rearrange the order of the siblings stories and the significant changes to character arcs in my opinion these script deviations have resulted in a less cohesive and engaging narrative compared to the beloved booksin conclusion while bridgerton offers a feast for the senses with its lush settings and costumes it does so at the expense of historical precision and narrative depth the shows departure from the source materials storyline has not resonated well
whats the chemistry in season  joking in a mud wow literally idk why they removed the romance between the duke and daphne like in episode  and  of season  i hated season  i hate it really too boring season  was a lot better than watching every second is like a punishment i swear another thing imagine if your sister told you not to worry about someone and forget them later you found out they love each other lmao dont worry there are other suitors this one is mineletting down your own sister who trusted you is mistaken for romance okayseason two rubbish rubbish rubbish rubbish rubbish
although it is indeed entertaining as a fan of historical portrayals of fiction it is painful to see the misrepresentation in terms of clothing customs and overall society i agree on the inclusion of people of color as a license but the rest is just infuriating
the ingredients of this series do not merge at all and the end product is neither tasty nor nutritiousdont expect to watch something relatable it is more of a fantasy series and in my opinion a really weak one if there is something deserving that one star it is only the handsomeness of the actors and actresses not even their performance i am not exaggerating saying that i wouldnt be surprised if one of them would bring their smart phone or tablet out to search for sexrelated questions or digging into the roots of certain behavioural issuesi do expect pop movies and series to be on the dreamy side but they must make sense this story could have happened in a contemporary time dresses and the decor depict the old times but the story tries to touch every modern issue from racism and sexism to mental health issues and their roots to the controversial issue of sex education and so on meanwhile in such an advanced and modern society it is okay for  year old girls to need queens approval to be presented to the society and get married at that agepure waste of time power and your internet bandwidth
its no wonder television and feature films are losing audiences theyre producing junk like this show i watched one episode which was very difficult and couldnt bare to watch another episode id like that hour of my life returned but it wont happen so ill use this experience as a life lesson in poor decision making by me
really boring after  minites but sorry it is very disappointing and cringing
"im sure if this had been made in england by english then it would have historically been correct for this period in time
i enjoyed the story and most of the acting but having watched wonderful series such as downton abbey and the crown i felt a little let down"
netflix could have at least kept this soap opera true to the historical period in which it takes place i fully expected to see blm posters hanging at the palace i realize minority actors need to work and i fully support that effort but as i dont want to see porgy and bess with white actors neither do i want to see minorities cast as royalty in  england to top it off the gossip girl narration was just too much
i had such high hopes i love period films the costumes and production pieces are stunning the modern input of material choices is seamless and beautiful but the strong sex scenes have ruined it for me the acting for me is overworked i watch period film for their authenticity for their reminder of simpler times  where morals actually meant something
im these times with metooblm netflix yet again jumps on the wagon promoting ethnic minorities and giving those that watch the series a false idea of hoe things were om the th centuryit literally makes me puke that they are brownwashing history
watching bridgerton is a pleasant enough way to spend a few hours but it falls way short of the quality of pride and predjudice sense and sensibility northanger abbey etc the casting is innovative and interesting but the quality of the acting is very patchy the less convincing performances are probably down to the actors not being suitable for this genre
bridgerton has nothing on downton abbey or the tudors i even like reign better than this historical accuracy always matters hence why hamilton is garbage and bridgerton is a joke
how is this for a role model when will we move women to the st century and stop presenting them as hapless creatures waiting to be governed by men
i found it to be rather dull than it originally in the books emotions were far from the reality seems a bit forced season  seemed quite alright but season  doesnt offer tht much quality in comparison
apparently we should look passed the historical inaccuracies of which there are a lot because it is a fantasy but if it is why put up a totally fake regency setting with an english queen and everything why not create a real fantasy world worked for george rr martin and go wild with boxing woman and men being the ones scared for their reputation for a change
oh look the leftist cult sh tsmears mass flagged my review to have it removed because they are so weak that they cannot tolerate an opinion that is against their own how sad for them so im happy to repost itrewriting history will never change the reality of history no matter how hard you tryyou want people to take your insanity seriously then try casting a white women to play the role of martin luther king and show the world that yours isnt a doctrine of rage but rather a code of equalitybut we all know that you wont because your sh t train only goes one wayyour leftist cult insanity will forever be ridiculed because flying in the face of reality cannot and will not change reality and only demonstrates that you are deep down inside simply mentally ill and this is not an actual effort to change society for the better but in all actuality the ravings of lunatics
i was excited to watch it unfortunately im totally disappointed the relationship between the duke and daphne is beyond annoying the rest is just a lot of bs
super slow and boring only good thing about it was the duke
i found it interesting to read the various reviews of the two season series of this tv productionlike one should expect the reviews varied greatly in critical appraisal proving just how diverse mankind truly is critiques should not be judged as absolute truth but as invitations for conversationsan english comedian arthur roberts  coined the word spooffor me this tv series was a pastiche of th century style the production produces a humorously exaggerated imitation a parody of a style  life long pastthe lavish elegant mansions country houses  the privileged lifestyle of the regency era is well documented  embellished here in bridgerton i for one enjoyed the amusing presentation of the opulent often pretentious lifestyles of the affluent who lived in this erabridgerton is bursting with regency inspired attire one of the greatest joys of period dramas are the costumes for which bridgerton does not disappoint they are historically accurate the queens wigs are sensational given their size  weight one may assume that they induced head  neck pain there are examples of archaic society rules throughout the series the social season  marriage market where real however personally i do not believe that this series was produced to be a serious historical drama nor a insightful look into the lives of actual families did shondaland ever pose this series as a real representation of the period even though there are some parts that are actually accurate i think notto sum up my view of bridgerton this regency era production pivots on the saucy shenanigans  sexual scenes  superficial explorations of the  london time period overall i found the series lighthearted visually pleasing  entertaining the entire cast  crew gave applause worthy performances in what i assume was a challenging production however the story episodes i fond to be quite repetitive and somewhat shallow if you decide to watch this series i would suggest you take it lightly  enjoy the splendour of the many outstanding beautiful  distinctive elements in this bridgerton series
so many people told me to watch it said its really good just watched season  and  honestly dont know why its been so raved about pretty uninteresting season  definitely better than season  however
i think the only reason this show became so popular is that people miss romance i watched the first  episodes and i liked the story at the beginning but the idea of not wanting to have a family and be happy because of a stupid vow is just so stupid and it kinda ruined the show for me
initially when i watched it the main onscreen couples chemistry will carry it through but a large part of it is intolerable it is a dumbed down romcom unrealistic representation of society but then if you want to show a utopian lie instead of being true to the period why not extend that beyond race to also show independent women or less class differenceand whats with the toxic relationship at the heart of this story full of lies and deceptionif you watch period shows dont expect this to join the ranks of those it is a soap opera that cheapens the genre sells sex and doesnt show any depth in characters watch it in place of a romcom and you may enjoy it
beautiful costumes sets and actors but story is lacking and quite boring at times the chemistry between the two leading actors is good and their light conversations are fun and entertaining only downsides are the preachy social sermons unrealistic boxing sessions and the constant adult lecturing to a kindergarten boy
i dont understand the popularity of this show i have tried to watch it three times and cannot get past the second episode the acting is horrible and the storyline is so simplistic i dont care about any of these characters i really wanted to like it but i am done
while the show was an enjoyable enough watch it missed the mark on so many levels bridgerton attempted to cast a rosy shadow on history by cutting out racism for essentially the sake of being diverse and trendy if you wanna tackle race in an english period piece do it well or dont do it all bbcs sanditon explores race and diversity so much better the shows are pretty similar but sanditon is far more nuanced than this soapy fanfiction of british history if you expected more from this show watch sanditon
back in  when bridgerton came on the scene and was all the hype i started watching i couldnt initially get past the first episode when all the characters were introduced i thought to myself are they kidding i instantly took a dislike to lady danbury and the queen their strong personalities completely turned me off as im sure that wasnt the writers intent but a theme i noticed throughout unlikeable males and strong brave females so i stopped watching i dont know why but i started watching again almost  years later here are my thoughtsseason  i loved the character of daphne shes a likable character and the actress playing her the character of simon on the other hand another unlikable character i didnt understand daphnes attraction for him the rest of the storyline bored me to pieces so it was hard to follow because i think i daydreamed through most of itseason  i loved the character of kate anthony on the other hand very unlikable character see a theme it boggles the mind if the author wants the main characters to fall in love why make the men so course and off putting it made me wonder what kate even saw in him because he had an intense look he gave her from time to time absolutely no redeeming qualities of anthony or simon the strong and brave women are supposed to fall for these men i dont think soeloise and penelope i loved these characters eloise is supposed to be a free thinking feminist and while normally that would be annoying she pulled it off and was likable maybe it was the actress that played her penelope while she annoyed me at first her character grew on me the actress is adorablei think the show was a hit and miss i think character development was lacking when youre rooting for the two main leads to not get together because you cant stand the man i think thats a big miss some of the story lines were entertaining and some were boring such as lady featherington daughters storylines that being said i will be watching season 
this was made for teens do not watch it thinking you are getting downtown abbey you arent definitely over rated
the show is honestly just boring i dont even care if its close to reality but boring is a big deal i enjoyed the end of th episode through the end of th and if you watched it  you know why so if you are like me and enjoy well shot intimate scenes  watch those two episodes and be done with it
if you take this as a spoofsendup of a period drama it might be ok otherwise its a hot mess dont expect much of it to actually relate to some kind of real recorded history for instance the costumes are ludicrously bright the sets all seem to be painted and wallpapered this morning the wigs are absolutely laughable and suddenly there has been a color change in the general population of britainthere is pretty heavy emphasis on sex and nudity because the overall plot and writing is so boring and lacking god forbid we should experience any depth to a story  even as an erotic film it doesnt make the grade if this is somebodys grand idea to infuse diversity into history then it is even more laughable people of color deserve a much better platform than this one
this is not good in fact its kind of a hot mess its visually stunning and thats about it mildly entertaining if you want to shut your brain off for a while but be warned you may forfeit a few iq points
loved the costumes and the places apart from that it seemed like a mediocre version of jane austens books which i love it tried to grasp the sentiments of that period of time but it felt kinda forced had no spirit its pleasant if you have nothing else to watch but i really dont understand what all the fuss is about
if you want historical accuracy authenticity and sophistication look elsewhere if you want highbudget cliché escapism youre in the right placei threw realism out the window and just watched the whole series its cute absurd and shallow watch it for the silly drama if you want but dont come crying to me if you start drowning in the gnarly reimagining of history
i think this was made by extreme idiots who are pretending to be not extreme idiotstheres something deeply dishonest about it if elizabeth holmes the well known con woman of theranos made moviesthis would be it
i will start with the obvious  i did not read any of the books i have however went through more than a couple of reviews after finishing the first and thankfully only season the overwhelming majority come from people who are big fans of the books  as one would expect this review however would be aimed at those of you who would unbiasedly expect quality cinemathe world of television is not without its fair share of great period dramas the bbc alone has made sure of that over the yearsbridgerton is not one of themthe cast is the shows lone bright spot  regardless of how you feel about racially accurate dramas this is hardly an issue worth discussing in   the best manwoman for the job gets it regardless of skin tone the actors each manage to make the characters their own by the end of the season it shouldnt have been too hard seeing as most of them are very onedimensional and favour a specific trait or personalitythe writing the costumes and the visual feel of it all is a circus of borderline cringe im almost sorry to say if you were to treat bridgerton as what it is you would not be displeased but those of you seeking a period drama with solid plot points accurate depictions and strong characters would do well to keep lookinghowever if youre in search of something light to leave on while going about the house or have always wondered what a watered down gossip girl would look like ages ago this is definitely worth a shot
never read the books so i cant critique the differences but im a sucker for period pieces brought to the screen this is one i wont be rewatching the storyline was confusing the sex scenes gratuitious and overlong and the premise for the dukes aversion to fatherhood not credible
season  was so good and after waiting and waiting season  was a total let down there is no explaination of where the duke is no one even asks daphne how he is or where he is there literally is no mention of him the entire season other than her saying she left him at homethe show got so far off the storyline of the book that you cannot even say it is loosely based off the book other than the characters the book says kate wins the game of pall mall by knocking anthonys ball into a lake i waited for that scene and it never happened i waited for the scene where kate is wandering around aubrey hall looking for a book in the library and it rains and you find out she has panic attacks when there are thunderstorms it never happensit talks about benedict being accepted to art school that will be interesting because in his own story according to the book no one seems to know that he can draw until he meets sophie beckett and she sees his drawings so that was a weird thing to bring up nowthis season was a snooze fest compared to season  there was no suspense from one episode to the next like last season where you couldnt wait to see what happened next i feel so let downthe story line with eloise and the queen thinking she is lady whistledown wasnt in the book and if this series keeps going that will be interesting trying to tie that into collin and penelopes story in season  a season where hopefully they will do better than the book did since there is so much build up in book   and and  leading up to their story although it is suppose to take place when they are  so that will be interesting as well since it the book says penelope loses a lot of baby fat and is thinner at  gets revealed to everyone as lady whistledown when colin finds out and doesnt even get mad about but instead brags to everyone about later when they are married after she has spent  years destroying people especially his familyi wish they would have followed the book more this season i wish they would have used the scene with the bee the way the book intended it to be  where anthony and kate are seen and they must then wed to avoid scandal but both act as if they are not pleased about it even though they secretly both arefor season  to have had so many side stories and sex scenes to this very very tamed down version that was so derailed from the actual story written by julia was just such a disappointment after waiting for so longthe best part of the series is the costumes and the sets please hire a new writer and work with julia quinn more to stick closer to her stories with the exception of colin and penelopes story in season  should you get there that story needs a total rewrite to make it much steamier after the years of build up and waiting for these two to get together especially if penelope holds out and remains a virgin all those years please for the love of god make it good
historical dramas should be historically accurate
that was so toxic and problematic that im still baffled after ending season  that was rape and we all know it lets not sugar coat what daphne did
ive never read the books nor heard about them before so i suspect that whatever first intrigued me to pick up or carry on with this show might have been the things that more or less sticked closer to the original story this as a production was extremely poorly executed everyone else here already stated why clickbait at its best well played netflix well played
absolutno not corresponding to history it is a pity because young people who watch such the tv show do not get a real display of history
there were many changes from the book i didnt really care for the changes there were added characters that didnt do anything for the actual plot except stretch everything out generally the costuming was strange for some instances and while the duke is perfect for the role why was his costuming some much more avantgarde than the other male characters who wore proper ton style clothing i understand what others are saying in regards to the diversity but on that point this is a fictional world that can look however the writer wants however i understand the reservations around that and if this wasnt an actual book first i could suspend reality but its a regency romance first which lends itself to certain expectations all in all its just ok for me ill watch this first season but maybe not another im actually kind of sad because a lot of the lighthearted fun wasnt included in the netflix version i just disappointed
theres no place on this app to play this video how can i rate something that i cannot watch
i get it we live in a politically correct worldwe have no choice but to accept that if we want to watch shows or movies anymore i have not read the books this is based on so have no frame of reference other than that netflix series having said that bridgeton is very empty the acting is really well done for what the actors have been given they each are acting as though they believe their charactersbut that is pretty much where it all ends for me honestly the biggest killer for me is the queen no it has nothing to do with her race but everything to do with her character the only two things her character has been given to care about is that her favorite people are choosing the correct mates and asking for constant updates whether the king has died yetalthough i do not know why those are her only two concernsas the queen of england oh wait a thirdparties as with most other characters that is the depth of the humanness they have been granted by the writers this is also known as lazy writing it is almost as though an american writer took all the stereotypes they had ever heard about early england and wrote it into a storyline even though nearly every single one has long been documented as fairytale and fabrication again lazy writing and severe lack of research yes i know it is fiction but at least get the time period and mentalities correct as the basiswhat could have been something of a downton abbey part ii series ends up being a vapid footnote of a small series of peoples lives it is quite reminiscent of the last couple seasons of greys anatomy where it was clear they had run out of good ideas and all creativity had become frustrated and took the early train out of the writing room so again  stars for the casts attempts to make it interesting but  stars for the empty and quite lazy writing heck it is stuff like this that makes me want to try my hand at script writingmay as well make a couple million myself if this kind of stuff allows the writers and cast to get rich
couldnt get past the nd episode it is soo cliche and is made for young teens with high expectations on cheesy romance
great cinematography good storyline the soundtrack was just wow this was supposed to be a great series but poor acting from the supporting cast ruined it
im going to start with the positive part the acting is really good but the movie reminds me a lot of fifty shades of gray and gossip girl in a jane austen era the main story is a damaged wealthy handsome young man who meets an innocent and romantic young girl the girl is trying to fix him
"it couldve been great the story is very good the cast is great  phybees performance is excellent but the sex scenes ruin everything to me there is no need for them to be so graphic is photography disguised as romance
its a shame it couldve been a very good show"
if youre looking for an easy watch romping romance in an austenian setting this is it it unashamedly makes no attempt at historical accuracy offering instead a spoof and caricature of the era the plot is weak and unbelievable yet unexplainably fun the leads are unconvincing but the older generation polly walker ruth gemmel ben miller and of course julie andrews do a good job within the confines of the scrip adjoa andoh steals the show along with claudia jessie if you take it for what it is then its entertaining and enjoyable once you get passed the first two episodes when the characters are mostly unlikeable and annoying they do grow on you
they could have done so much with the second season yet it was boring and dragged out for way too long edwinas relationship with the viscount was stretched far too long in the book it barely lasts past one dance all that drama ruined the lovey dovey sexy aspect of the show so boring obviously there were parts that were engaging but it doesnt even compare to season one what a let down
awful show terrible music horrible costume designs and not based on any reality
"i really wanted to love this show and for the first half of the season i did it was only after watching episode four that i began to completely lose interest in the main characters emotionally abusive relationship with one another yes there are some steamy moments and all is well in the end but the level of disrespect these two have for each other despite claiming to be so very much in love is maddening i wont argue that it is most likely telling of what relationships in those days were really like but it still left me yelling at the tv over their sheer lack of communication maybe the books are better
regardless the supporting characters are fabulous they are the saving grace of the show had it not been for their side plots and the mystery to find out who is whistledown i believe i would have stopped watching"
this show has so much potential but fails in every arena it could be a love story but its a story about sex it could be funny and there are opportunities for humor but it never happens it could be an adventure but theres none of that either its about a girl falling in love with a bad boy and getting her first orgasm wow thanks a lot netflix and so glad that every young girl in the world is watching this and thinks this is what love is
the show itself is average the plot is foreseeable and nothing new the actors are okay even though most of the time i cant really feel for them except for benedict and eloise even though there characters havent really been developed to have more than one dimension up to now but what really angers me is the soundtrack at least the intradiegetic part of it and im shocked that nearly no one else talks about that trying to cover modern pieces in a classical style even though to the producers this just means letting a string quartet play them can work out well if you pick the right pieces eg pieces that have at least a slight chance to fit into the period rhythmically and melodically in this case it didnt the only song that at least didnt totally disrupt the immersion was wildest dreams because it actually has a little bit of melody you can clearly see the producers wanted to lure more young people in and didnt think they could endure the series if they would use fitting music bob who do young people like well my granddaughter listens to ariana grande and billie eilish the last straw for me to write this review was the disturbing dismemberment of the third movement of the four seasons i dont want to go into detail lets just say it was sacrilegious lets hope twosetviolin never finds this series or else they would suffer of bleeding ears and eyes watching the musicians play stuff that never actually happens in the music
this is just an english telenovela with no originality at all it is a mix of jane austen plus gossip girl plus marie antoinette and then you have this nothing remarkable i terms of originality honestly fun to watch and then we will forget
if you want to make a film about the era you need to show the hardships that people facedthe story is interesting but very factually flawed it paints a more happy go lucky anyone is welcomed in high society that was not the case back in the day there was a lot of woe if your skin colour was not right and people that came into wealth were not just given titlestotal load of crock
i usually love this kind og costume drama but this one misses the mark it has been hyped up by the press but fails i read that there war a sex coordinator on site during filming but for what  there is not a single scene in this series first  episodes that even hints at sex
it is an agony to watch since there is no chemistry between the leading malefemale for both seasons to the point that its too unnatural the few characters that were more real are penelope eloise lady danbury and mrs hearrington the rest are just sadly too fake or has nothing noticeable
honestly this show wasnt my cuppa however the music is fresh and entertaining the sets and costumes are exquisite and the leads are likeable enough
the worst season so far unconvincing acting chemistry is gone in this season everything looks so forced it seams lime from friends to some fatal attraction in  minutes the boy who plays colin seems to be reading a text off the wall his face has a frozen expression in every series the series is carried by francesca and her energy the books are different they are not so shallow except for eloise everyone else has the same mission from season to season how to get marriedits completely clear to me that these are romance novels but that doesnt mean they cant be a little more innovative i hope that they will save the world and that they will finish with screen adaptations of books for this decade
season  was great i kind of liked that it wasnt in modern times it was a little like trying to reboot gossip girl only a hundred years earlieri loved all the sex omg 😱 season  was pretty boring compared to season  i didnt like that the two main characters were not part of season  also season  has no sex scenes i think thats why the show was so popular not sure why netflix decided to make season  super boring and no sex scenesi am pretty sure the reason for the success of season  was all the sex scenes not sure how you have a steamy first season and then change the dynamic of the show and make it more pg please bring back the sex in season 
okif you are enjoy classic period pieces you will not like this it is no pride and prejudice or emma if youre older and enjoy downton abbeyyou wont like this the story is pretty cringe and seems rushed and not well thought out however i see the appeal for younger people who may not be into period dramas hopefully it is a stepping stone into real period piecesit is pretty mediocre in my opinion but that is not because the cast is diverse i really like that there is a diverse cast who cares about historical accuracy many of these shows arent even when there are no poc these comments do not care about accuracythey are just bothered that there are poc in thisim pretty convinced that most did not watch the whole thing just because they saw a poc within the first  minutes since when is adding other human beings that happen to have a different skin color than you propaganda and political correctness ridiculous grow up they are human i bet these same people are crying about how they dont see skin colorwhen obviously they do and theyre bothered snowflakes 
the phenomena of color blind casting in historical productions has its origins with socially liberal british producers in britain audiences are more used to mandated diversity casting by some networks in historical dramas which may or may not utilize color blind casting however typically american productions do not i must admit i prefer to see characters as they would look like in reality not in a symbolic nature there are some people who believe exactly what they see  i am not a believer in productions leaving more questions than answers my opinion is historical productions can have diversity without misrepresenting history in general though thoughts about color blind casting are a matter of taste  style there are no right or wrong answers
"i finally cave in and watched bridgerton everyone is talking about it so i couldnt not see this
i found it terrible boring with a few sparkles of potencial springled over the  episodes
i think the  hour long episodes hurts the pacing maybe  to  thirthy minutes episodes could have been so much better
the production and the vestuary is amazing the score is really good except a few choices the actors are ok the direction is meh
and dont get me started on the parties and sex scenes the are to many of them and always is filmed the same so after a while it gets really really boring
in the firt half is conversations and going to parties in the other half more conversations more parties and now add the sex scenesi truly belive this had so much potencial maybe with shorter episidoes a better direction and editing"
seriously all this series has in common with the books is the name of some of the characters and one or two plot points otherwise they are totally different animals the books being far betterto whomever is responsible a point a good actor is a good actor regardless of their skin color kenneth brannaugh did not find it necessary to rewrite shakespeare to justify casting denzel washington your making the queen black in order to explain the presence of black people in your cast is insulting to your actors
first season had great romantic scenes and steamy sex scenes second season like so many cut out the scenes that made it so steamy this whole season seems to have been designed for mainstream tv and not for netflix if you give it a tvma rating i expect you to hold true to what made it a hit the only thing that stayed the same in season  is the back stabbing and arrogance of the staff i was bored so many times during this season and found myself playing games instead of watching major letdown
"originally i was shocked at this take of a typical british historical show with the mixed races no one was crying out against poc taking purely caucasian roles but politics aside
loved the tension and characters of season  it melded beautifully and was very entertaining especially the  leadsseason  was ridiculous completely disappointed after the first season no chemistry tension was way too forced the side stories were bland and boringguess we will see what they do with season dont have high hopes just watch season one"
highly hyped this disappointed quite a lot its the michelin restaurant equivalent of squirty cream light and predictable plot deliciously over acted a gentle sunday afternoon viewing at best  i think the us audience will lap it up and think theyve had a history lesson enjoy
four stars for the pleasure of observing renejean page not much else is worth the watch i did like nicola coughlan penelope featherington though
this show is cringey i love the costumes and diversity but the story is garbage lets pretend we are dating but were not dating is so played out somehow i watched  episodes without a barf bag maybe its for teenagers because it is not for me i watched dawsons creek when i was young so who am i to talk
"season  felt rushed to me the producers and writers should have taken their time to draw out the story for two seasons in my opinion to fully flesh out the characters and give everyone some much deserving depth
by the time anything consequential happens to anyone you hardly care because sufficient time wasnt devoted to developing who these people are and why we should care about what happens to them
the end of this season was dissatisfying as well overall i probably wont rewatch it unless i want to watch some softcore porn"
despite all the nice scenery costumes and fun modern twists that i loved here the entire relationship between hastings and daphne  especially after the wedding  was so annoyingly childish toxic and painful to watch that it literally made me gag at times the fact that they both act like spoiled dishonest children with less than zero communication skills is  cringe im sick of media trying to convey the message to young people that this sort of communication between partners is about passion and fate rather than just being toxic
i thought the acting was good but the stories in the main story could of been a lot more in depth all the costumes and details of that earache were great can we see more about the other men from the pick of sutters not enough about the queen either
i had a few expectations for this show after all when you read shondaland in the credits you immediately think of greys anatomy et al but and this is a big but apart from the dresses they are cute even the outlandish ones featheringtons wear and a few situations here and there this is a predictable and widely stereotyped series not even the diversity helps the only character that is barely interesting is eloise daphne is so bland pretty and when convenient super smart and sassy and then back to being a silly young girl which one is it and the duke he is incredible to look at but boy oh boy what an annoying and undecided man is he bipolar sheesh anyway i watched the whole thing and it was the worst finding out that penelope is the gossip girl talk about a cold shower no depth to anyone on this show
since every time i review bridgerton i drop a point soon i will be at one this is my third review and i am dee bee refuses to publish how very very very odd very odd odd
its not that badbut it is blandi wanted to like this series if only to spite all the horrible reviewers there were also two other major points why i really wanted to like this i love costume dramas and i love my occasional romancethe setting is great and costumes props and scenery are just gorgeous the actors do a fine job but their performances cant save the script or directing here i havent read the books this is based on but i have to assume that this is yet another case of the books were amazing but it just didnt translate to screeni wanted to avoid touching this but ill just say you have to be watching this through some prejudiced lenses to really notice or care about the diversity a lot of people make a bunch of noise about the actors are chosen well and fit their rolesbut while the show is a joy to visually watch its not that joyous to consume and digest its not great lets just say it i cant pinpoint the reasons why it feels so bland but you should be the judge for yourself maybe youll like it it certainly looks amazing so if you can get into the plot pacing and way of telling it youll probably love itunfortunately i just couldnt get myself to finish this series maybe ill revisit this at some point since i do love a show that looks this great
i think there is something special in this series i watch this because i just want to know about the culture
this did not live up to its trailers and all the hype but i disagree with most of the negative reviews i love the diversity of the cast even if its not historically accurate this is a fictional show so there should be no issue in changing elements to modernise it especially in regards to racial equalityto be really honest elouise and penelopes relationship and hunt for whistledowns identity was the best part of the plot benedicts growth in independence is also noteworthy i really didnt care for the romance aspects however especially when theres unnecessary sx forced into every episode which is highly unrealistic and embarrassing to watchthe classical covers of modern artists such as ariana grande were cringey and not to my liking i wouldve just used basic music pieces from the period but i can see how theyd have appeal to the shows primary audience of teensoverall watchable and moderately entertaining ill be interested to watch the next season
to start i have not read the book somehow it did not cross my path even though i love period books as this my favorite author being georgette heyer and jane austin a close second i am from a diverse family myself and have no issue with creative license to make a fictional story that does not match historical accuracy if it understood it is fiction and it took such liberties as it did an example being modern tunes played by an orchestra but this series does not live up to its potentialwhile the settings and costumes are vibrant the characters are lackluster dull boring or annoying like eloise the characters did not come across as they should by either bad script bad casting and at times both pens character is the exception and came across as the most believable she portrayed real and true human emotions and was neither dull or annoying and the actress played her well overall this is a series to watch if you in the mood for a period piece and can overlook the liberties it took and dont expect a masterpiece as some give it but it not a total garbage rating as haters gave it so in the middle rating i give it no more than that too much dull writing and bland characters to give this anymore than a  or  star rating
i wanted to love this show and for the first half i really did the costuming and casting is amazing its a lot of fun the string covers of modern songs was a nice touch i liked a lot of the characters and enjoyed getting to see a variety of relationships develop and i was really rooting for daphne and simon at first but spoiler the rape in episode  left a bad taste in my mouth especially the fact that it went completely unacknowledged regardless of simons lies daphne was absolutely in the wrong and yet daphne is made out to be the victim and simon is forced to apologize and give her what she wants anyway i absolutely despise daphne and i couldnt root for them after that no matter how badly i want them to be together in the beginning
if you wanna spend some time watching sth youll enjoy it but its not great
i love this show i love the diversity the beautiful multiculturalism the dresses the backdrops the locations i love the music the direction and that it is made by shonda rhimes the greatest television producer everbridgerton is my new favorite netflix show i hope they continue to celebrate diversity inclusion and convey history in this way tooamazing show
i liked the first episode but it quickly went downhill from there the plot is as predictable as it gets and i correctly predicted all the period tropes and plot development but this is not necessarily a bad thing as this isnt the show you watch for clever commentary or brilliant writing this is your bogstandard nice girl tames the badboy story with a few sex scenes that are filmed to appeal to housewives all the characters are onedimensional essentially perfectly distilled tropes they did put a lot of effort into the costumes and choice of colors so its visually quite nicein short this is a trash tvshow like a pocket romance novel with a picture of a barechested riding a white horse with a young innocent woman in his arms that you find in a bargain bin for a buck but just because its trash doesnt mean you shouldnt watch it if you like this sort of things
started the series because of the attention given to it but once i have started it i cant seem to find the reason that this show is hyped up
"can our shonda do it again can she recreate the drama the emotion the fun reel us in with her lovable yet flawed characters the colourful writing and then leave us weeping into benjerrys with heartwrenching twists as an echo of how to save a life fades in can shesadly not as it becomes clear inching into the first episodeif you dont know what im referencing above i suggest you may need to reconsider your priorities and google meredith greyback on to borington in short bridgerton is nothing more than a vanilla melodrama with a few fancy costumes on top full of cliche and historical inaccuracy episodes feel dry and plotless compared to the majesty of counterparts such as downton if you are in market of wanting something resembling gossip girl come pride and prejudice but worse this is perfect the orchestral rendition of thanku next and other pop bangers are welcome moments of interest during the chore of lengthy episodes the mystery of the covert lady whistledown offers a degree of momentum to the series and keeps the viewer just about interested enough to make it to the end in case anyone reads this and notices there is very little detail in my review i must admit i cant really remember what happened this alone speaks volumes as to the unremarkableness ness of this showto conclude a bland tale mildly enjoyable and not completely terrible
shonda stick to the greysloan memorial hospitalexcited to unleash my first review ever this was fun in a lockdown  kind of way"
"firstly there were black people in th century london so i cant understand why people find it so distracting to see poc cast in nobility it is fiction not based on true events personally i find it way more distracting to watch historical movies set in foreign countries where the all of the actors have american accents and we all know certain religious figures were not white but dont have a problem with them being depicted as so
but unfortunately this was a watered down period drama with a weak plot and shallow characters some trash tv in corsets which was a shame"
"a nice fictional documentary about the early s very well filmed and some characters really come across i bet most ladies will like this because of the overkill of romance and sweetnessi just cant get past the flawshow can they have electrical lighting in a fountain in the early s
planes in the background
th century addons to buildings"
i think this series is great i have to admit i wasnt a fan when i first saw it as it went on i started to like it the costumes are great and i think its how it was like in the s i think it is like it i i think its not boring at all it kept or is keeping me gripped thank you to everyone who were involved in making this fantastic series i like it the characters are great in it and they are strong
gratuitous sex poor dialogue perfect décor and style delightful colors clean roads and houses neat shiny people even the farmers it is just a scientific fiction movie not real period drama adopted from books too many sex is absolutely an necessary scene in wedding chambers specially it is a sacred place at that time one time or hints more than enough
ive seen before a diverse cast thrown into thick thick costumes saying long intricate lines with a grand soundtrack in the background and still have it feel sincere and relatable this is not one of those cases none of these situations feel remotely humanlike and their priorities and conversations are so far removed from what the current youth is thinking it should be satire but it at this it also failsi dont get it if you remove all the conversations about getting married and having kids you end up with pretty much nothing its so bad i wish i could stop watching at their empty little facesstars are for music scenery and costumes
i dont think it was really suppose to be to the fact of the period but more of entertaining mabey like soaps are the actors were ok and the best one r j page was the best one i thought and he will not be returning next season so wont watch any other season plus how can you create a strong figure in the show and then not try to bring him back i like period shows like this but disappointed for the next season tudors is a great series to watch also
if youre looking for an easy watch romping romance in an austenian setting this is it it unashamedly makes no attempt at historical accuracy offering instead a spoof and caricature of the era the plot is weak and unbelievable yet unexplainably fun the leads are unconvincing but the older generation polly walker ruth gemmel ben miller and of course julie andrews do a good job within the confines of the script if you take it for what it is then its entertaining and enjoyable once you get passed the first two episodes when the characters are mostly unlikeable and annoying they do grow on you
s was gross to put it best the main character daphne literally sa her fiancéhusband in order to become pregnant 🤢the show treats it as a good thing and the victim deserved to be assaulted its even worse in the booksthe show has many problems regardless but that is just an immediate nos has most of the same problems in term of script and stuff plus the historically inaccurate elements but i much preferred it it was far more entertaining than s the pacing was so much better and i didnt fall asleep like in s lol i loved kate and what ever his name was much more than the duke and daphneid give s a  and s a 
"ok so i thought it wasnt too bad up until around episode  or 
the first episode starts out quite well and sets up the core conflict of the story finding marriage for the girls in an efficient and entertaining manner i appreciated the quick stylish cuts in the beginning that showcased the hectic chaos of meeting the queenthe fake courting between daphne and the duke was pretty entertaining but honestly it devolves into a bit of a mess and just gets boring after a while there is a lot of sex in this series and i really dont get why its there other than to be scintillating to the viewer which is great i guess if thats what youre looking for but its not really something that i was all that impressed by so for me it works against the shows favor from a narrative and pacing standpoint the sex just slows everything down and i ended up skipping through a lot of those scenes to get to the plot lolim currently on episode  i just had to get this off my chest will come back to this when i finish the whole series"
this show is for the enjoyment of married women yo and up specifically women married for  or more years i should know my wife loves it myexperience
i wrote a review  weeks ago which has now disappeared or been removed my review was a  i read all the books and absolutely love and adore the stories and the characters in the books i was so devastated and disappointed when i watched the show and how they portrayed the much loved bridgerton family so i stopped watching after episode a friend of mine urged me to watch the rest and so i gave it another try i must confess i managed to watch the whole series and actually i liked it after episode  the story improved and anthony improved and was actually bearable from episode  onwards i just had to forget about the books because the show is not the bridgertons i know and lovei still dont think that blind casting works for a period drama but i can overlook it i gave this a  in my second review because i like simon and benedict and anthony is exactly how i pictured him in the books but only his looks not his character as he is much nicer in the bookssurprisingly most to myself i am looking forward to season  now because anthony and kates story is my favourite along with benedict and sophie and francesca and michael i do hope netflix does anthonys story justice and should there be a season  i hope they get benedict storys right because it is so romantic in the books
i mean it really is just a rather sad rendition of english literature the plot wasnt poor but some of the dialogue was really useless and unnecessary the thing that annoyed me most was the use of modern songs in the ballroom scenes because honestly if you are going to do a time piece i dont want to hear the chainsmokers in the background good camera work and scenery though
