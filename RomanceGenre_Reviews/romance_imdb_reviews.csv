"A fun, dramatic, fantasty gulity pleasure.","As a 23 year old black dude, I actually liked this show. I honestly thought it was going to be a full on comedy, but it actually had a lot of dramatic themes. I won't lie when i watched the first two episodes, I was very, very confused as to why there were alot of black royals. I thought for a second that this was true, but if memories served me right, it wasn't. But then I began to understand that this is all fiction and a made-up fantasy on what if life was like this.
And I have to admit, I kinda liked it. Some people don't like the film because of it being politically incorrect. But there are HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS of period dramas that are more accurate than this. So why don't those people just go and watch those? I think people just want to complain about something because human beings are never satisfied. Even some of the greatest period dramas that are pretty historically accurate has it's fair share of haters. I didn't take it seriously. I just turned my brain off and enjoyed the fantasy.",7
Breathtakingly Beige,"If you're going to be historically inaccurate in a period romance for the sake of politically correct diversity - fine. You can be forgiven for that.If you want to argue that what you're writing is 'fiction' so you're entitled to write whatever you want - fine. It's true. You can.But.If you do, if you proceed to go where angels fear to tread, then you had better make damn sure the 'fiction' you're writing is amazing.Unfortunately, this Bridgerton adaptation by Shondaland is anything but. It has all the 'amazing' of beige wall paper in a beige room with beige furniture. You just get slapped in the face with all the disappointing beige.Shondaland has completely rewritten the best parts of ""The Duke and I"" and turned it into a generic shadow of its former glory. All that remains of the original story are bare bones.Just focusing purely on the story - the shows writing is uninspiringly generic, with tired old storylines introduced.Why???If it ain't broken, why fix it?The original story is amazing. It needed nothing. No fixing. And instead, Shondaland broke it.Pretty is all well and good on camera, but it's not enough to make a great show. A great show needs more. Where is the humour? Where the sparkling dialogue? Where the personality?Muscles, beauty and gratuitous sex do not chemistry create. Personality is sexy. Originality is sexy. Humour is sexy. Sexy things the book has in spades. Things this show has not been able to reproduce.But the worst atrocity Shondaland has committed?The characters. They lack character.They have been recreated as barely there shadows of what they are in the books. Almost all of them.Anthony: Unrecognisable. His treatment of Daphne, his surly immature moodiness, and his wanting to run off with an opera singer. Not Anthony. Anthony always put his family first in the books because he thinks he's going to die young like his father did. He would never have forced his sister to marry anyone. Anthony was charming, confident and kind.Daphne: In the books she was never ""a diamond of the first water"". Daphne had been out three seasons already. She was a very likeable, down to earth, easy to get along with, dark haired girl - not a clueless insipid vain blonde. Her friends were the wallflowers. All the gentlemen felt comfortable with her.Simon: In the show Simon is a bland generic hero. All muscles no brain. No real conversation. No humour. Simons famous stutter makes no appearance whatsoever, except as a child. Simon in the books is reserved but passionate, super smart, longing for family. He is thoughtful. In my opinion this actor had no emotional range. He was wooden. He actually made me yawn.Simon and Daphne together in the show are also uninspired, lacking real chemistry. In the books they sparked. They were funny. They made you love them as a couple.Colin: In the books Colin has a way of seeing into people. He is probably the sharpest and most insightful of all the Bridgertons. Colin in the show is a clueless puppy. And his hair is terrible.Violet: Where was Violets sparkle? Her moxie? In the books she is admired and adored by all her children. Violet has a sly sense of humour, especially when it comes to match making. She outwitted her children. She knew what she was about. She is a respected leader in society. She made things happen. Violet is not the worried lip-biting unsure mother the show has given us.Lady Danbury: In the books Lady D is sassy, opinionated, and scathing. She says things to throw people off balance. She's feared in general. She's a menace with her cane. The shows Lady D is too refined, too tactful, too nice. Lady D did not openly play match maker with Violet.Lady Whistledown: She is witty - never truly mean or cruel, which turns out to be Penelopes saving grace in the end. We loved reading Lady Whistledowns humorous observations in the book. The ton eventually see it as a right of passage in society to be mentioned by her. But in the show, they paint her petty, cruel and hated.Bridgerton Family: The family in the books is loud, boisterous, irreverent, loving and fun. They joke, tease, talk, play and are fiercely loyal to each other. They are all friends, which makes them differ from the usual ton families. In the show, that family makes very little appearance. The family of the show is (for at least 6 out of the 8 episodes), shallow, vain, fraught, disjointed, uncommunicative, distant and, to be honest, a bit annoying. This is not the Bridgerton family of the books.In short, many of the 'read the books once a year for years' fans, will, like me, be very disappointed with this series. Some adaptation is always expected - but an almost complete rewrite?Make no mistake about it, Shondaland has rewritten, dismantled or removed the majority of the best parts of 'The Duke and I' for this show.Let's hope they do better with season two.",7
Mainstream Wattpad Historical Romance,"Let me just start that I am a fan of the books so I am watching this as I did when I watched all the live actions of Pride and Prejudice, with eyes finally getting my wish of seeing my fave books come to life, and I was not disappointed. Is it a masterpiece? NOT AT ALL. Is it accurate to the books? Not so much but they did get the heart of it. There's a lot of issue I find with it but somehow I still find myself watching it because I love the genre.To note: If you are into the ACCURATE retelling of history then I'm telling you right now SKIP THIS. This isn't about the accurate retelling of history. So if the ""diversity"" and ""wokeness"", the designs of their costumes, the way they acted takes you away from the story because of inaccuracy then you will have a bad time. This isn't a documentary. This isn't a biography. This isn't a true story.Now first of, the books star different siblings so each season will focus on different Bridgerton with splice inserts of side stories. S1 is more steamy and shoves a more lustful play on their romance it's a fake love turned real love trope. S2 is a slow burn and might be boring for some as it is less steamy, it's an enemies to lovers trope.Now. If you're into the book series do give this a try! Of course it wouldn't be 100% accurate but I did feel that it was very true in how romance book genre goes. It's like a whimsical romance. Glazed over. Or whatever term. Something like those Hallmark Christmas romance movies but with more mature scenes. Modern music made classical. They really brought to life the family dynamic of the Bridgertons. I love how they interact with one another as a family.Finally. If you're just looking for a Pride and Prejudice or historical setting romance show then do give this a try! You might just like it.",8
Not as bad as many reviews say,"I read a lot of negative reviews. Especially about the characters that do not correspond to the era. To be honest, I think you shouldn't be too heavy on that. It's fiction and it just looks good. It is a shame that the first episode is the least fun. This would almost make you stop watching. Fortunately, I looked further, which I certainly do not regret. It seems nice and I am looking forward to season 2.",8
It is entertainment,"This is not a quality Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth Pride and Prejudice type series, or downton abbey. This show is an exaggeration of those kinds of tales and it is pure fantasy, using the back drop of victorian english high society. Do not take it seriously and enjoy it for what it is. It really highlights the absurdity of that time period as well. I love the pride and prejudice series I mentioned above and to me this movie was like a guilty pleasure version of that kind of genre. Costumes are beautiful and they threw in some modern music played classically, so really, this show is not taking itself seriously as a period piece, and is clearly just having fun. Have fun with it and enjoy the eye candy.",7
2nd Season,"Usually I find myself disappointed by second seasons of shows, especially when the first is so good, and as such did not have the highest of hopes heading into season 2. Having recently completed it I can confidently say that it's better than season one. What about it made it better I cannot say, though I am a sucker for forbidden romance and the removal of those awful sideburns made Anthony 10x hotter. The second season is a must watch with a thrilling slow burn and an incising story. I cannot wait to see how this show plays out and stand witness to each Bridgerton siblings season and the pages of gossip it will bring.",9
"Best Actress ""Claudia Jessie"".","Claudia Jessie played Eloise with extreme class. Hope she continues to ""stun the stage"" in her future acting career!",7
An excellent cumulative of YEARS of waiting for this.,"Here are my thoughts#1. I have to note that I had reservations about this when I first saw the casting of Simon and other POC actors. As a black women I didn't know if it was pandering to my ethnic group or if it was for genuine inclusivity. And after seeing Simon on screen I must say that he is PERFECT!! I literally can't picture him otherwise (and I've been picturing him for over a decade. (I also have to say the same for lady D))#2. I was surprisingly pleased with the Marina character (btw she's not new to the series. Just early). She will fit in like a puzzle.#3. I'm enjoying how flushed out Anthony is. I admit he was a little 1D for the first book since he wasn't a main character so I appreciate that tv allows him more dimension and build up.#4. The rest of the siblings are excellent too. The seeds of their characters are coming through.5. The visuals, directing, and music reminds me of a TRUE historical romance book. This doesn't feel like a made for tv show. I love how they managed to make the colors so beautiful and vibrant unlike other historical romance movies/shows that have everything ""accurately"" bleak.This series was my very first introduction to the romance genre of books when I was a little girl and I could not have asked for a better pilot episode. The characters, the chemistry, the intrigue, the intensity (this list goes on and on) is exactly how I pictured it and how I felt when I first read this series years ago.To all those that worked on this series , everyone from the actors to the crew, your artistic talent has not just made beautiful period piece show. No, your artistic talent has magically translated all the beautiful things I love about historical romance books and the writing of arguably the most famous HR author of modern times perfectly to the screen and to that I thank you from the bottom of my heart.",10
Well that went over like a turd in the punchbowl.,"WARNING, SPOILERS!I love the show. I do, but this was a bit of a letdown.They led us in a direction they didn't follow through with.I don't think I was the only one under the impression Lord Debling would be head over heeels for Pen. It was disappointing to not see her get that adoration. I just don't understand the thinking there.Our girls glow-up deserved more. This too was a letdown. At least one Lord should have been giving Colin a run for his money.I did not like at all whorey boy Colin.We should have watched them innocently fumble through the blossom of young love. Colin is not a rake. It was kind of gross.I did enjoy the introduction of Francesca and the sweet nature they gave her. It will pay dividends in the future is they don't screw it up like the fake rake.I thought the Fetherington girls were hilarious these first 4. They had some great lines and Mrs F. Never disappoints.I was really hoping either she or Mrs. B. would be given a true blue love interest that would tease to knock our socks off. They are both amazing actresses. There are so many possibilities there.One more thing. Why on earth was Colin celebrated the hero when Debling literally saved Pens life? She's not a worthy enough treasure to leave the ton swooning at her rescue?Some of the little side stories they are building just took up what could have been more Colin and Pen time.It was sorely lacking. We had no big build up like the last two couples.We all know the importance of forplay before the big scene and they stole that from us. That's what I'm most dissatisfied about.I will continue to watch of course like everyone else and hope for more meet and potatoes but I'm afraid it will be more along the lines of kippers and mash.",7
Dashing,"Eloise and Lady Danbury are by far my favorites but I liked it all overall, quite different than the book but keeping essential plots and the essence.
I do love the diverse casting.",10
Rubbish,Wondering how the overall rating was 7.4 when all the reviews I see are below 3?!! Waisted an hour watching this awful drivel. Enough said.,
Readers are missing some points,"I am well aware of Quinn's Bridgerton series, but people are not focusing enough on things such as directing, plot, acting, etc. Who cares if there weren't black aristocrats? This point keeps dragging and it's honestly quite pointless. Quinn herself expected a very inclusive cast and a re-interpretation of the series. Stop wasting your energy in worrying about ""pc culture."" Have some imagination.Now, the plot is predictable for a novel series like this. I chose to watch it with my mother and it was enjoyable like an afternoon conversation with friends. Nothing deep really, lack of subtlety. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing. People often forget who are watching series and films, forgetting that some may not understand the undertones of a message. Bridgerton's lack of subtlety is beneficial for them, for my mother who doesn't understand English aristocracy because of our background. She loved the series.It is a VERY colorful setting. Wonderful clothes and scenery. There is a lot of individuality represented through that. Some characters certainly felt re-interpreted from the original material. For example, I hadn't imagined anyone with particularly loud personalities, mainly in presentation. The series provides this. Admittedly, Daphne was an absolute bore many times. I was not passionate about Thompson. So basically, some characters were louder, some were more tame when compared to the original. At times I welcomed the change, but not every time.Anyway, I look forward to the progress of this series. I also look forward to people relaxing a bit and trying to understand that media enjoyment is different for others. Literature majors may scurry away from the predictable and superficial, but (for example) someone whose main language isn't English and has always lived in a low-middle class neighborhood may feel welcomed into a different culture and may start a learning opportunity. It's not about absolute accuracy, it's about captivating our attention at first sometimes.Oh and also, I don't think the subtitles in Spanish are the best. There are words that change tone when translated. I listened as I read the subtitles. I had to re-translate a few times so my mother.",7
Thoroughly Enjoyed it!!,"Knowing nothing about the books or what to expect from the show, I gotta admit that the diversity threw me in the beginning. By the second episode, I became colorblind and grew completely enchanted by it all that I didn't want it to end.
Although I loved it, to be quite frank, in a way it made me sad. All the diversity.. well, it made me see how the world COULD have been and needs to be.
I eagerly await the second season!",9
"A long time fan of the books, and a fan of the show","I first read the books years ago and this adaption has done it justice. Perfectly cast. The people obsessed with the ""diversity"" should know that this isn't a factual historical show, but a version of Georgian history that lives in the minds of all of us who love this type of thing and really need to get over it. They also didnt play string quartet versions of ""bad guys"" or ""thank u next"" back in the early 1800s. Basically, it's what I've dreamed of and waited for!Adore that they've kept the main storylines but complement them with lines that add, rather than subtract to the main line.Thank you Shondaland!",10
"Loved it 7/10, Season 2 is better than season 1. Better acting, better storyline. Not too much sex and not too much overacting. The right balance is in season 2.","March 2022: season 2 is better, the acting is so much better and the storyline as well. The actor who plays Anthony (Jonathan Bailey, he deserves bigger on-screen roles) is an outstanding actor. Skip season 1, only watch season 2. This season has the right balance of drama, laughter, character development, and build up. Season 1 was too much s*x, season 2 is good and not too much s*x. Season 1 is worth max a 6 because of the bad acting. Season 2 is worth a 7.5/10. The chemistry that Anthony and Kate had in Season 2 was amazing 😍, I didn't feel that with Daphne + Simon something was off (without the intimacy that was scripted/coached they looked like friends).The actor that plays Anthony carries his role well, he's through and through Anthony Bridgerton and a hunk (he has no sideburns in season 2, so much better) . Jonathan Bailey deserves to be on the big screens now. Such a diverse actor that can take on any role. He's very good with his face at expressing emotion.Can't wait to see Anthony + Kate in the upcoming seasons helping the other Bridgerton siblings. They confirmed that they will stay.December 2020: Phoebe Dynevor (Daphne) deserves more recognition. She carried season 1 and it was mostly shown through her gaze (the female gaze). No wonder most women are having the hots for Simon (Page is such a bad actor, who is overrated and who looks too feminine). Now he's leaving the show what an ungrateful actor. + In the voice of Lady Whistledown: Rumour has it that Page is closeted, has a beard and is not speaking his truth.On a positive note, I loved the diversity in the show. Truly amazing how they not only chose white characters to be represented as the rich in society but a diversity of people with different skin colours. Just like it is nowadays.Anyone who critiques this period piece, needs to do some research, this show was made by a producer that is renowned to cast a diverse cast. This tv show is fiction and a new period piece on it's own. It's a modern makeover of the Regency period drama and therefore more relatable. Also, stop bullying the fact that a variety of people with different skin colours are represented in the show. Those people lack imagination.",
"Started strong, writers bungle season 2","I loved season one. Watched it twice in a row I loved it so much. Thought they did a great job and actually improved on the book. Season two, unfortunately, did not. Kate and Anthony's story is by far the best of the novels - the main reason being because it is FUNNY! I was looking forward to season two the most because of this, and while I don't mind the overall massive rewrite and plot changes they added, the writers didn't include any of the funny bits that make this book enjoyable and endearing. (And what a missed opportunity for character growth on the practically non-existent library storm scene!) The show on its own is very well done and the acting is excellent, I just hate when screen writers of book adaptations try to ""beef up"" the drama and, in so doing, remove all the goodness that made romance readers fall in love with the story in the first place.",9
Season 2: A dull remake of Season 1,"The costumes, settings, music are all beautiful, but we've seen them before. This season lacks the substance and intrigue that led so many to bingewatch the first. A gaping hole is left with the resolution of Simon and Daphne's romance. The love triangle between Anthony, Kate and Edwina feels forced, with none of the actors particularly charismatic. The heightened focus on Eloise is detrimental, with the actress' eyerolls, overreaction, and unrealistic conduct reminiscent of Anna Chlumsky as Vivian in Inventing Anna. The other subplots are so redundant that they could have been crafted from film left on the editing floor in Season 1 and weren't enthralling on the first go-round (e.g., Penelope's unrequited infatuation with Colin).My rating of 6 is the average of a 7 for Season 1 and a 5 for Season 2.",6
Do not listen to 1star reviews - I am delighted I did not,"Is it entertaining? Yes. Do I expect from fantasy to give me accurate descriptions of the world? No. It is fantasy dear viewer. I am actually disappointed at the reviews, since I am quite convinced people genuinely lack an understanding of the word fantasy. It is scary out there. I expected something light and lovely and with the exception of some scenes it was highly entertaining. Some viewers will deceive you into thinking you must bring reality into fantasy. Since when? Is it revolutionary? No. But it is a piece of heaven and hard work. And it shows.",10
"Season 3 nowhere near as good as 1,2","I enjoyed the first season, I loved the second season even more, third season was kind of boring, it go so boring I just read while it was running in the background.I give Season One a 9. Season Two a 10 and Season Three like a 6.5 and I don't think the rest of the seaon will change my mind the way things are going.The only thing that kept me interested was the delightfully subdued interactions between Francesca and John. I really enjoyed how their romance was so much different than the others, and not just a repeat of the same. I could see the chemistry in their interactions and how their love languages were so different to those around them, really refreshing.As for the main story between Colin and Pen, BORING. It was like bad fan fiction. It was like there was no character development. I felt no chemistry between the actors. It was like they were just going through the motions to follow out a set outcome, and then they are just having sex in a carriage which would be scandalous for such a young woman.I don't know what will happen in the rest of the season, but I seriously don't know how Colin could get over the utter betrayal of Pen being LW. It would be fan fiction bad writing to try and get out of that. If Pen gets found out for being a total life-destroying gossip who makes money of other people's suffering, and she gets a happy ending? I really don't know how it works out in the books, but this pushes my suspension of disbelief too far.",7
Brilliant adaptation with a modern twist.,"Ever since hearing this was going to be made into a series I have been anxiously awaiting it. This series has gone beyond my expectations. I love the costumes, the pageantry, and above all the cast. Each character is very well represented by the actor/actress portraying them. I love the addition of a diverse cast. It in no way detracts from the story and makes it a beautiful representation of today's society.
I was nervous at first that the move to the big screen would not carry over the beauty of the story but I am happy to say that I am in no way disappointed. This is a great series and I highly recommend it to everyone loved the books or just loved a great romance.",10
"Season 2 - Watered down colors, story, music","Last season was fun fun fun, with Episode 6 all sex, but that's another story.This season, it's full of older men vying to marry girls who have barely turned 18.Also this season, (I'm on Episode 4) it's all watery colors, music and weak story. Nothing is really fun, except for Queen Charlotte, of course. And Penelope. She's still a pip.Where's the vibrance and verb and fun? It's gone.Another Season 2 where it seems that all the good writers have been dumped and replaced by ersatz staff.",6
Review only for season 2,"Season 1 was great.Season 2 is as follows: I love you, I hate you, you love me, you hate me, we can't be together, we must be together, we love each other but can't be together, let's get married, let's not get married, it's your fault I love you.... no joke 8 episodes of that lol.",5
The Pits,Take my word for it and just don't bother with this awful show. Incredibly bad is the verdict. Tried to like it but failed. Couldn't even get through the first episode. Ugh!,
To those with no imagination,"The fact that most of the low reviews are for the ""historical inaccuracy"" it is so beyond laughable. To compare this show to a historically accurate drama would the equivalent of saying that the Lord of the Rings is a documentary . One can not fathom the ineptitude of you withering minds. Of course your comatose racism has been jolted awake in your zealous defence of history and accuracy. Ha I say to you ha! History for the most is made of fantastical manipulations by hose who concurred and won the wars. But I digress since that is besides the point. The point is, this is fantasy . It is a genre. Google it.",10
Charming!,"Facing a Christmas Day at home alone this splendid release was perfection.
I'm halfway through and I'm in love with Simon the very handsome darcyesque Duke, and the lovely Daphne and the Jo March frustrated Eloise. It is gorgeous to look at. It is witty and warm and faithful to the romantic ( or even erotic ) literature it is based on. The hand touch between Simon and Daphne is far more sensual than anything written or portrayed in Fifty Shades. Just luscious !",8
"Pretty, fun and thin","Fun for those who enjoy the frothy visual thrust, light story and modern casual take on costume drama. It's a trashy soap opera in a dream version of Regency. I do like the diversity in casting and experimentation in costume. Casting is strong. However I can't seem to appreciate this production as much as I wanted. I find the direction and delivery of lines tends to self conscious, loud, stagey and over the top. Also the soundtrack is the same thing again and again, pizzicato strings, not creative, boring that flattens depth of emotion or drama. Otherwise a heady trip with lots of short scenes whipping from one character to another. It's good, just not totally my cuppa. A pleasant pretty distraction.",6
Season 2 puts content over nudity,"I am writing this review after having watched the series, followed by reading the book ""The Viscount who loved me"". This season has offended many ardent book fans and I can see why. The Kate Sheffield of the book and the Kate Sharma of the series are two entirely different people. The book was written primarily for female audience. Therefore Kate Sheffield appears to be similar to reader-favourite Elizabeth Bennet- a witty girl next door with some severe insecurities. And she has her feet swept away by the deveilish playboy of the 'ton' i.e. Anthony Bridgerton. Even though he is shown to have physically attracted to her, he always remains in control of the situation- in a way guiding Kate to a whirlwind of challenges and then confusing her feelings.The series however was clear about its narrative character, i.e. Bridgerton. Hence Kate Sharma was written for the male audience. It takes a lot more than intelligence to impress a man. Men adore bravery, independence, free spirit and a great deal of selflessness. The charismatic Kate Sharma hence knows how to ride a horse, goes on hunting, remains undeterred by Anthony's or any man's advances, acts completely selfless to the point that she is willing to walk away after leaving her family with Sheffield money. She therefore makes Anthony crazy, as he finds absolutely no control over her. She pushes him to his extremes. When they speak its not just a witty banter, its a display of their strong character arcs. Kate Sharma is far more of a ""tough cookie"" than in the books. This is why its Anthony who feels swept away by the woman. He tries his best to get rid of his desire for her but she continues to make it harder, by doing , well, nothing. Yeah, its weird. While Anthony takes pride in confusing a woman in order to seduce her, he is maddened that he is unable to do that to Kate Sharma. He is unable to break her to the point until he finally breaks and admits that he loves her. He is forced to do so by his own feelings, as he grows into acknowledging that what he feels for Kate is far more than desire.The 2 stars that I have deducted is for the almost dragging subplots of Eloise and Penelope. Even if I forgive Penelope storyline, Eloise perhaps became way more one-dimensional in the 2nd season. That is my opinion.Nudity in this season was toned down to almost PG13 level because the content was stronger. Afterall its about a man growing out of his fear for true love and settling down with his muse. The target male audience perhaps appreciates less such scenes and more of the actual adrenaline rush.",8
"Season 1 absolutely fantastic, Season 2 lacks sparkle!","Season 1 was exciting, brilliantly written and its acting was very well executed. Season 2 lacks the drama that was captivated in Season 1. Season 2 did not completely win me over: The plot was poor and it dragged out two characters' love for each other without drama or sparkle. While it is nice to expand other characters in the plot, I was expecting so much more, I only hope the writers will redeem themselves in future seasons.",7
Gossip Girl Meets Pride and Prejudice,"I never read the books so I can't compare. I had no idea what this show was all about but I definitely heard the controversy with having POC in it.I really can't imagine a woman alive seeing that unbelievably handsome man who played Simon and not falling in love with him.The show was sappy and soap opera-ish but entertaining nonetheless.I laughed. I cried. I fell in love.There are definitely faults to this show with many characters but it's charming and I enjoyed it anyway.Daphn was a bit too ""Kiera Knightly"" for my tastes, but she was cute.Anthony was one of my least favorite characters as he was joyless and just boring.Eloise was charming and very Jo March-ish, which I liked.Simon was so handsome and Mr Darcy-ish, I couldn't help but love him.I wondered if Dan Humphries would make an appearance as Lady Whistledown (lmao)I'm glad they revealed her in the end rather than make us wait (if there even is a second season).I'd like to see Penelope get a happy ending.
Also, I'm curious who inherited the Featherington home (if they told us I missed it).I hope Will (the fighter) was not hurt due to the Featherington bet.Overall, I was entertained (which is the point I believe). I will definitely tune in for a second season.Sometimes you just have to put reality out of your mind and take things for what they are. It's just fiction. Don't take it too seriously.",8
Season 2,Unfortunately I did not like season 2 as much as I loved season 1. I found it boring and the story line wasn't great either. I hope they will change this on season 3.,6
Regency escapism,"The sets, the costumes, and the cast make this regency romance sparkle.",9
Sumptuous Regency Series,"You can rely on Netflix to splash the cash when it comes to a series of this kind, and Bridgerton doesn't disappoint with beautiful houses, lavish parties and exquisite clothes. I found myself suppressing a laugh at some of the men's hairstyles which made them look like 1950's Teddy boys, which I am sure was not intended.
It's a handsome series - the Bath settings are thoughtfully and artfully reproduced, and the plot is better than average with a whole string of Bridgerton siblings needed to be married off. Everybody seems to happily live with what seems like the double standards of the era, and Julie Andrews' Lady Whistledown is a plot masterstroke.
I am really enjoying it, even if it seems to veer between Mrs Gaskell, Jane Austen and Jilly Cooper. It is very good entertainment and I am looking forward to a second season.",7
All the glitters are not gold,"This is the 3rd season of Bridgertons and I'm tired. New shiny costumes, elaborate sets, pretty ppl, soothing music, that's about it for this show. The only book i liked from the series was book 2 and that was unnecessarily butchered in the name of drama in season 2.I am not much for historical accuracy as I don't have vast knowledge on British History, but i do care for a bit of logic, a bit of beautiful performances and a bit of beautiful making. But this show has already exhausted all of their resources and at this point everything looks like it was a chore to be done.I am glad Nicola aka Penelope got her story for season 3 but boy was it felt so tiring to watch her going to a ball to just end up crying every single time. The writers were just going in a cycle of dress up - ball- cry - outing - dress up - ball - cry - outing. I think 3 episodes should have been enough to wrap this whole thing up.And don't get me started on Luke aka Colin. I have never felt such second hand embarrassment for any lead like i felt for him. The wooden performance with one facial expression just shows getting physically attractive can not save an underwhelming performance. Especially beside Jonathan and the other Luke, who tend to steal the scene anytime they are in it, just like Claudia. In theory the makers are telling u Colin is now a suave sexy charming fella but on screen he came across confused little boy, reading dialogues from the teleprompter and delivering them without much conviction.I don't know why i keep torturing myself by watching these shows, this can't be even passed as a time pass. The makers have budgets, why not invest in good writers and good storytelling? Even the good actors seemed like they were in the show to play dress up only and delivered half hearted performances. My expectations for season 4 is wayyyyyyyy below 0.",5
Ignore the poor reviews grab the popcorn switch off brain and enjoy,Ok so its not inline with history so what just give it a try .My guess the poor reviews are from those who just watched one episode and sadly have zero imagination.,10
Joyful fun,"Such a fun and joyful experience to watch. Love the casting, truly some of the dreamiest actors around!",10
loved it,"I absolutely loved it..
it's classic and romantic and enchanting.. love the cast.
it's perfect for everyone who loves the old classics.",7
Really love this series,"Its a great series. Not supposed to be the books, but a different version inspired by them. I like the diverse cast and the amazing costumes. I've been a Julia Quinn fan since she started writing and I think this series does the Bridgerton books proud.",10
Are there an decent American screenwriters left,"Can't understand the entertainment value Americans get out of bad scriptwriting for shows that take place in Europe. This is on par with Emily in Paris, complete crap and forgettable.",
Season Two was a Letdown,"I really enjoyed Season One despite some repetitive sex scenes but Season Two was a slog. Eventually I started to ask myself how many more episodes to go? There was much to like except for the boring love story that dragged on and on, only to end up in a few minutes at the very end when rather suddenly all was well and good in the world. Whatever. I won't watch this again, and I've watched Season One several times.",6
Season 2 - not as good as season 1,"As much as I enjoyed season 2, there wasn't enough of Anthony and Kate's story. I get that the stories of the other characters need to be fleshed out some, but there's a whole part of the story in the book that relates to the time after they're married that is juicy and got completely ignored. The actors have great chemistry, it would have been nice to see more of it.",8
Season 1-10/10......Season 2 - 5/10,"I've watched season 1 a month or two ago just before Season 2, and from curiosity I've decided even to read the books (in my opinion the worst books ever). And I was astonished how all those actors and producers and writers could pull up such a piece from such shallow and lusty story (I mean the book), and above all that that actor, with a stunning performance - With all my respects to all the cast and crew to Bridgerton , you did an amazing job and bring joy and delight in our lives with Season 1, but Mr. Regé-Jean Page just made the entire season so attractive and magnetic - he just stole the show from the first ride.Season 2: I personally vote 5 - for the amazing play of Mr. Jonathan Bailey, but even he couldn't pull the whole thing, and somehow the whole piece was looking like a patchwork, even though in my personal opinion -I know there are a lot of fans here of the books - the second book is even worse than the first one, and could maybe make the writer's job a bit harder.My Admirations to all the crew - the costumes, the light, scenography, sound...for both seasons was that good.",6
Money's worth!,"Full marks to the cast and crew to bring our beloved characters to life from the page! Though there are some major diversions from the books, the stories of all main characters remain essentially the same. It does give us readers something different to look forward to, some surprises!Absolutely loved the cast. They are inch perfect. Acting is stellar and I had no trouble imagining them to be exactly who they portray! Thanks for bringing the Bridgertons to life, all of you. Looking forward to season 2 already!",10
I watched only season 2 and I didn't regret it.,Wow 😮 Jonathan Bailey and Ashley Simone (Kantony) had amazing chemistry. I only watched season 2 as I love slow burn romance! Recommend it to anyone that does too!,7
Not even 1 episode,"Please be accurate to the era at least if you're going to have a period drama, I'll never get back that time. People raved about the series but I really didn't see the appeal.",1
Excellent show!,"Another Shonda Rhimes hit! Loved it!For those low ratings, don't listen. If you read the comments, they all have the same theme, ""divers."" Not sure what divers have to do with the show but...oh well!I enjoyed the diverse cast :)",10
I loved it!,"I haven't read the book, didn't even know there was one, so i had no expectations of this show.
I don't understand the many giving it low rating at all.
It's a fantasy show, i dont need it to be accurate, i need it to be entertaining and it absolutely was!
Great costumes, humorous storyline, the chemistry and mystery i was enthralled. Can't wait for more!",9
Pointless!,"Wash, rinse repeat, same stuff over and over, even the Wisteria stays the same. Never any rain, do Americans not know about our climate?. Pretty sure I have never seen anybody here in little puffed sleeves surrounded by daffodils. There is no depth to anything, but then how could there be when the characters just swan around in their finery, ball to soirée, drinking tea and gossiping. What is the point to any of it?",
Research could have been better,"They bring in Indian element in the 2nd season. However, research was half baked. Sharma is a North Indian last name. Also, the ""ladies"" refer to their dead father as ""Appa""! No one, but no one says ""Appa"" from Maharashtra onwards. The writers and researchers seem to have gotten that confused, I believe. To get that wrong, in today's day and age, makes me give it 2 stars less.Apart from that, I have yet to find something that I don't like in there!",6
Shonda Rhymes meets Downton Abbey,"I binged the entire season right after it dropped! Like JQ's well-written books, I couldn't put it down!!",10
Season 2,"You were thinking to yourself ""I'd like to see Season 1 of Bridgerton with the exact same story but with two different leads, and less sex,"" then Season 2 is for you!",7
It's Regency Romance Trash - what's not to like??,"I read all the books when they came out years ago. I re-read all of them before Season 1 dropped. The amount of hate this show has gotten in these reviews really confuses me:""It doesn't follow the book at all"" - duh - it's an adaptation of a book - things HAVE TO CHANGE for adaptations for various reasons - and most of the changes I understood why they made them, creates more drama and distinct characters.""It's not accurate to British regency era"" - duh - it's a fictional romance novel written by an American and it's not supposed to be based on fact. What about the trailer made you think so? They had pop music playing during a formal dance scene...It's like these people haven't ever seen Grey's Anatomy, Gossip Girl, the Bachelor etc - it's not supposed to be based in reality - it's a popcorn movie. Mindless entertainment.Also I have noticed that the ""most helpful"" reviews are those that are lower ratings and those with positive reviews are marked as ""not helpful"" - not suspicious at all...Can't wait to see my review get marked down as well :)I throughly enjoyed my binge watch - this series is not perfect by any means - sometimes the dialogue dragged, the main character - Daphne - isn't as developed as she could've been, etc - but the costumes/sets were great. The drama was there. I was entertained and will probably re-watch soon.",8
Ok....but!,This second series had much promise and expectation following on from the first series. I must say though that I found it somewhat lacking in some areas. I felt the love triangle was very good and the tension between Anthony and Kate was believable. I found the Eloise character extremely annoying in the second series. The way she treated her friend Penelope was awful and ransacking her bedroom was not what you would do to a friend. The queen was splendid as was Lady Danbury again. I was also disappointed with Colin Bridgerton in his horrid treatment of Penelope. I do think Penelope should have divulged her secret to Eloise which would have prevented all the shenanigans of Eloise. I hope the third series improves.,6
"Charming, lovely production","I'm not familiar with the Bridgerton source novels but this is a racy, entertaining and often funny update of the Austen and Bronte novels every teenage girl reads that are considered classic literature and have little pretense to historical significance. I loved the casting of all the major characters and the diversity of the whole cast. It is not life as it was, but as I wish it were. It is lovely to watch and a great diversion with no motive but to entertain, which it does. Relax and enjoy it for what it is. I've never watched a Hallmark movie romance and don't intend to but I feel confident the story, performances and beautiful production values are on another level entirely.",10
Ruined so much potential with season 2 & its foolish plot holes !,"I loved the season 1 and rewatched it multiple times coz why the hell not ? The chemistry , the heat , the intrigue and the story line was done to the perfection . But , season 2 lost the charm. It was a fun watch nonethless but still the storyline with kate and Anthony had so many loop holes that i can't believe how writers spew that nonsense for 8 episodes. Kate is the most un-decisive character ever to exist , she keeps on manipulating her sister for marrying Anthony while at the same time provoking Anthony, like what the hell is this behaviour girl? Decide something first . Anothy had a traumatic teenage life which leads him into becoming a responsible head of the estate who thinks if he married for love he will suffer for the rest of his life like his mother ; which is quite understandable. Yet Anthony keeps on making mistakes; the first one is choosing the wrong sister to marry, and the second one is leading on Kate simultaneously with his sexy soft spoken whispered dialogues .The story arc of kate and Anthony was a huge mess to begin with . It started off quite dreamy but with the introduction of kate's intro in the scenerio it was a huge let down .Though i was glad they ended it properly .Miss Kate Sharma keep on mentioning, ""I'm going to india"" for like millions of times in each episode, which was so annoying . She is portrayed to be so strong willed yet she can't decide whether to let her sister get married to a man she likes or to speak up for herself . This totally ruined the show for me tbh .Despite Kate and Anthony's doomed love story , the lady whistledown and the Featheringtons had quite an interesting and eventful season . The character development, especially of Collins and Lady Featherington was quite remarkable . I would also like to mention the amazing soundtrack of this season . The classical rendition of Harry Style's Sign of Times made me jump off the couch with excitement . The music score was truly exceptional .",6
The worst thing I've ever had to watch in my entire life,"My girlfriend watches this in my house, and its absolutely monotonous to witness. I used to complain about how bad 'Married at first sight' was when he watched it, but after finding out this exists, I don't even mind her watching the alternative.",1
Colour,"I wish people would look beyond colour. It's a factious period drama. So what if black people are Dukes, ladies etc.",10
A lovely historical fiction series,"I really don't understand all the negative reviews for this series, but I respect everyone's opinion. I am not a big fan of historical shows, I probably would have never watched this had it not been recommended by a friend, and what a pleasant surprise this series has been! I enjoyed every second of it. This series has nothing to do with history, it is a fiction story simply set in the past. Lovely settings, amazing wardrobe, lovely cast, smart and engaging story line.
If you are looking for a romantic series set in an alternative past, simply based on fiction, then you will enjoy this. If you are serious about history and how it should be portrayed, meaning strictly keep to the facts, then steer away from this show, it is not a historical series.
On a personal level, I am looking forward to a season 2.",9
BEST Neflix original for 2021,"Not only is it an amazingly good series, but it is a beautiful storyline, some incredible characters, that have you crying & laughing (no spoilers here) brilliant acting from all and great cinematography & music.Please watch, a history documentary it isn't, but it does have lots of spice!",
"Over the top acting, poor storyline & too fast paced","1. Daphne over acting made me cringe in the last scene where it starts to rain and she is enjoying the weather. Her facial expression completely inappropriate. I mean who even does that
2. Simon's dull & monotonous acting throughout the film just bogged me
3. Eloise's cringe-worthy facial expressions when she is nervous and overacting in every scene irritated me all throughout
4. Penelope's fast faced dialogue delivery left me confused all the time.
5. I understand period dramas follow certain dress code for casts but here I felt all the young women's cast was running out of breath due to their corset or maybe ill-fitting clothes
6. Obviously pop songs converted into classical music was also cringe worthy. However there were exceptions when they played Shostakovich.
I would still prefer watching pride & prejudice hundred times rather than this",6
Almost perfect,"I have read all the books and I enjoyed it. I was very excited about this tv show. When I saw the trailers I was a little bit disappointed because the actors where not like I imagined them in book. But after I started watching I really enjoyed it. Yes, there are some differences in plot, new faces like Ms Thompson, but its cool. I would say that maybe has more vivid plot that book itself. Yes, ofc it would be nice to follow the basic plot, but its just fine for me. Diversity is fine too. It's all part of our creativity and imagination.",8
"Season 1 is fun, Season 2 is cringeworthy","Bridgerton is a romantic fantasy that some will find a bit of fun and good for escapism (including me). The leads of Season 1 had chemistry and overall the ensemble puts in a good performance. The sets and costumes are amazing. So the 7/10 is for season 1 alone.Unfortunately the leads in season 2 have no chemistry and their limited acting skills, esp of the male, are glaringly bad at times. I skipped parts because the cringe factor was too much. The side-line stories are okay, but that's it.Unfortunately the actors chosen for the Bridgerton family are not lead actor material, so it is difficult to have each season focus on one and make any sort of real substance. They're fine as supporting characters only. It's left up to the other actors to really hold it together, and that doesn't work in season 2.",6
Escapist fun,"This is the tv equivalent of delicious cake topped with swirls of frosting. Sweet and fluffy and beautiful to look at. This isn't historically accurate and isn't trying to be. It is as meaningful as any of the myriad of superhero shows out there, which somehow elicit far less vitriol than this. Hmmm. Wonder why? If you're looking for meaning or history, this ain't it. If you're looking for an absolute visual treat of pretty people and prettier costumes and a bodice ripper brought to life, then this is a winner. Enjoy it for what it is, escapist fun, or move on!",8
Sophomore struggles,"Everything I loved about season 1 (the passion, the story, the chemistry between the lead characters) was lacking in season 2. The best plot lines in season 2 were for the supporting characters and not Anthony and Kate. It was really much ado about nothing in the end. I struggled to finish the last 3 episodes. I'm hoping season 3 will be more exciting because this got a bit boring.",7
Delightful,"A refreshing take on historical drama. The humour is inspired, the costumes are divine and the cast all played their parts perfectly. I was hooked from beginning to end. Definitely recommend.",10
Charisma element...,"Wrong choice of protagonists, especially Kate and Edwina. I tried hard to feel a connection with Kate Sharma, but even the unfunny Anthony performed better. I would have liked to have seen the Duke this season as well. The character's face of debauchery, victimhood or anger still made it difficult. So, the charisma element was something that was missing for the connection with the characters.",6
I didn't think it could get worse. I was wrong.,"It was like they took Pride & Prejudice, Cinderella, Jane Eyre, and Little Women, rolled them together and squeezed all the character developed and drama out of it. On top of that, they used modern music with period correct musicians. It added a new level of cringe when I heard it.Where did all the good writers go?",1
Just take it as it is...an easy and nice story,"When you see ratings of just 1s and 10s you realize that we are discussing a controversial show.It's actually worth watching if you like period romance movies. Is it historically accurate? Slightly...but who cares, take it for what it is; you can still enjoy it.The costumes are really superb and actors are good. The show it's a 7-8, I'm only giving it a 9 to balance all the extreme hater's reviews here :).",9
Shut Up the show is Fine,"The show slaps if you're looking for escapism (who isn't) and if you stick with it, by episode 3 you'll be invested. @ everyone who's mad about good diversity and representation can shut up and go watch game of thrones 😌💅
Also the costuming and makeup isn't that bad historically speaking and I haven't seen brastraps once (for this I give it 5 more stars)",10
Series 2 so boring!,"Loved first series but series 2, my word so boring, the characters are dull and I'm on episode 5! Such a shame as I love the idea. Have the writers changed? The characters don't seem to have any real story to get their teeth into, so it's not the actors fault.I hope it improves soon.",6
Ignore the 1 star reviews,"Wonderful, entertaining, and an asthetic accomplishment....even the music is exciting. There's also a lot of good humour. I'm not sure what people are complaining about. The acting is superb, the costumes are amazing and the story is interesting. People really need to stop giving silly reviews as a way of protesting perceived ""political correctedness"" or ""feminism""
Watch and judge fairly. This wasn't ever meant to be a documentary. Stop being ridiculous.",10
Quick question,"Is there any straight, black man who watches or is interested in this? And not 'cause their girlfriend made them. Or is it just me? Because this only ever comes up in conversation when I talk about it with girls. Anyway I thought season one was decent, maybe a 7-ish/10 and the mystery of who lady whistledown was really kept me intrigued and must say I was disappointed when we find out who it was but it didn't take away much from the season as it wasn't one of the main story arcs really. It's also funny how blindsided we were on the raunchy scenes; the first 5-6 episodes or so were something you could watch with a kid next to you, but once the sex starts it's almost ceaseless, 'when it rains it pours' situation. I was really surprised when they announced Regé-Jean Page wasn't going to feature in the following season, he made most of the headlines in season 1. I haven't watched season 2 yet because I've seen mixed reviews and a lot of people saying it's not as good.",6
"Trolls will out, I guess","So, people are talking this VERY seriously for a stylized quasi historical romance. Here are the main criticisms and my counter:1. Historically inaccurate: Is it inaccurate? Yup. Based on the fabric alone (hot pink not really a Regency colour). Did I care? Nope. The show clearly went out of its way to be stylized. If that bumps you, so be it, but I don't believe it ever claimed to be accurate. It reminds me of ""Marie Antoinette"" or ""The Great"" in terms of intentionally bringing in modern elements. Look, usually historical inaccuracies bother me (I have a 30 minute rant about the Mulan remake), but this just didn't because it was so clearly going for a look.2. Diversity: get over it. 'Oh no! Every character isn't white!"" Seriously? People need to give their heads a shake, see point 1, and if people are that prejudiced, might I recommend every other Regency show ever? I am rolling my eyes skyward at the "" it needs to be all white casting"" crew.3. Changes from the book: on this, I can't comment. I haven't read it, but I enjoyed the story well enough. Though, I have seen an equal number of ""they changed so much"" and ""it was so faithful"" reviews, so I hardly know what to think.4. No humor: humor is subjective. I found a great deal in the show, but everyone has a different sense of humor. I enjoyed many of the characters and their relationships and found that the show wasn't overly serious. There were many moments that had me chuckling.I enjoyed this show. Exactly what I was looking for in the moment. It was a suitably entertaining confection; light, fluffy, and delightful. And not at all deathly serious.",8
Season 1 great season 2 MEH,"So season one was steamy and tense. Season two was just tension that was overly abused! Like it was a cycle that never ended until the very end. Whoever plays Edwina, she is a great THEATRICAL actress, but on screen everything is very theater and overly emphasized! Like the dog could have died and she would have smiled through it, it's just over the top emotions with her, very theater.I certainly would recommend season 1 but season two was meh.",6
"Just finished, ready to watch again","I'm so disappointed in the 1 star reviews. The creators have put a spin on a ""period piece"" never once did I sit there in disgust that it wasn't historically accurate. I applauded it, the diversity was a breath of fresh air, it was easy to understand what was going on, and the costumes were amazing. Do the people who give one star reviews do this to fiction movies? My only complaint is that there is not enough episodes!",10
I really wanted to like it but...,"I wanted to like this. I really did. I watched 3 and half episodes trying to convince myself it was working. But nothing is really grabbing me. I got used to dark skinned nobility easily enough. But everything else - the story, the dialogue, the characters... it's just not engaging my heart in any way. There is no depth anywhere. Actors are fine. Some of them are really good. But they are given nothing to work with.
I want to care but I find nothing to care about here.",7
Victorian age with a new image,Netflix is doing great job by letting us escape the reality and live in an amazing world even if is imaginary.So watch if you're missing romance and imagination in your life. A totally great serie with lovely costumes speech and metaphors.,9
An amazing show !,"This is such a good!!!!, The soundtrack and the story is amazing!",10
It's woke and very weak,"If you're thinking of watching this show, just find anything else. Literally, anything else. This is pure woke programming out of Netflix once again.It's extremely boring. The dialogue is terrible. The lead actors are untalented. I can't believe they made more then one season. The reviews above four stars all seem unreliable.",
Loved the first season. Second season...,"I didn't like the second season as much. I think they made a grave error on releasing who Lady Whistledown really is. This isn't the only issue I had. The two sisters from India were beautiful, but lacking in their acting abilities. I couldn't buy in to either character's believability. One, so naïve and the other so obstinate. The entire story is also very tiring. It seems to go on forever. Back and forth and so on and so forth between the sisters and the elder Bridgerton. I just wanted it to be over...lol. I do rate it at a 7 though because most all of the acting from all other characters was great. I love the outfits and the jewelry. I could go on and on about the jewelry.",7
Don't listen to the bad reviews!!,This show was so easy to binge and fun to watch. I am glad I didn't pay attention to the bad reviews.,10
"A dramatic, more serious adaptation of a funny, light book series.","As many people have mentioned previously, this series is an adaption of Julia Quinn's steamy romance series. As a long time fan of her work, I was not amused by the direction this series went in. I have read the entire series multiple times. The books were lighthearted, funny, and rarely accurate to the historical time period themselves. As such, the historical inaccuracies in the Netflix show amused me rather than irritating me. The partially black cast may not have fit with the time period, but then again neither did Quinn's original characterizations, most of whom treated women with the respect they rarely had back then. This is a work of fiction, as reinforced by the random snippets of Taylor swift and Ariana grande. The thing that did irritate me was the direction they went with many of the characters I loved in the books. Everyone that provided comedic relief in the books suddenly became mean, awful, or unnecessarily dramatic. All of the comedy was replaced with drama. Simon and Daphne were the only characters in this season somewhat accurate to their characters in the books. Due to the changes, I'm not sure if season 2 will be able to redeem some of the characters enough for me to like them again.Summary: Do not watch expecting a historical accuracy or Quinn's or lighthearted comedy. STEAMY: Do not watch with anyone you wouldn't watch GOT with. Watch with the reminder that this is from the same person that gave us Grey's anatomy. Overall, decent way to kill time in 2020",7
Very Entertaining,This was definitely a show you could binge in one day and enjoy every moment of it!,10
It's Just for Fun,"I don't believe the show ever professed to be more than a dramedy that's simply set in a different time.
Shondaland has never been known for its stunning accuracy in the settings and methods of what is happening in the background. If the viewer is hoping for a historical documentary, they may wish to watch something else.If the viewer is looking to get caught up in a love story, some scandal, some mystery and have a few laughs, this is an excellent option. It is easy to love the characters that you're intended to, and hate the ones you're intended to; to have your heart softened, to feel joy and sympathy and even a little jealousy here and there ;)So check your intentions before consuming.",7
The perfect tv show!,"I really love this show, the cast is so talent, has very love in this work... thank you for all dedication of all cast.❤
I need SEASON 2! 👐",10
Season 3 was GARBAGE for me,"I have really enjoyed this show so far, giving seasons 1 and 2 maybe a 7/10. Yes the show is a little bit cheesy and historically inaccurate but it had its own spark and quirkiness that I think would be lost if it was historically accurate. The characters were mostly likable and the tension and passion in the first 2 seasons are why I liked watching. This third season is different, I can barely remember episode one even though I just watched it, the acting felt so forced and awkward and I was just bored. Colin's character does not come across as sultry, mysterious, and charming to me and it is VERY CLEAR that's what the writers wanted him to come across as. Penelope is just awkward all around. I understand that she is supposed to be kind of awkward as she was an outcast, but she's still coming across as desperate and/or awkward in the ""romantic"" scenes. I sense no tension, romance, or connection between her character and Colin. It's just so cringy. Also, why even add the story line about the Mondrichs? There is almost no development into their story and it's just pointless every time they come on screen and make an obvious observation about their life in high society and then go away. I have struggled to finish watching but as I conclude episode 4, I don't even want to watch the rest. Maybe they should have released all the episodes at once so I would have compulsorily watched the rest because I have a feeling I'm not the only one that currently plans on not watching when they release more.",6
Cringeworthy and embarrassing,"What is the point of this show in 2020/21? It has nothing to offer except for being a awful version of a Jane Austin novel. The writing is poor, the script awful and acting stunted. I'm black British and found it too cringey to watch.",1
It's Fiction,"I absolutely loved this series and I can not wait for more! I understand the comments about it not being historically accurate, but with that said it's a fictional tale! I personally like the diversity they decided to add. I binge watched the entire show in a couple of days, and it held my attention from start to finish!",9
"Outrageous, Preposterous, Over the Top Beautiful!","I absolutely loved this series, once I got it straight in my head that it is not another Downton Abbey. Other than the fact that it states it is set in 1813, nothing about this show is historically accurate. There is not even a nod to propriety or history, but don't be disappointed by that. Enjoy it for what it is, a wonderful fictional show. The costumes in the first two episodes are wonderfully flamboyant and entirely over the top, as are the sets and scenery. You get a full data dump in the first episode, so be ready to absorb the characters in all their impropriety. After that most of the costumes are toned down, almost to the point of being boring. There is romance and intrigue happening all around you, so keep a sharp eye. If you blink you'll miss too much! The story line and acting was delicious. I loved every character and am ready to binge watch it again! If you're looking for a very good synopsis of each episode check it out on Vulture.",10
Absolute dross. Simply appalling!,What on earth? Why? Who? How much? I'm almost speechless at this utter dross. It's actually frightening that Netflix can embarrass so many capable actors with such low brow nonsense. And worse still that Netflix viewers find this brain-dead rubbish even mildly entertaining. Everything about this production is just horrific!!,
something to be said for innate sexuality,"It seems many people agree that this season was less sexually intense than the first season. After having watched both, I conclude that against what is politically correct in this world today, when one is attracted to a certain sex it does come across on screen and we are not buying it when you have to play that you are attracted to a sex you are not attracted to. As a woman, we know when men are not attracted to us, and for that reason, this came across to me with this actor. I did not have any attraction to him sexually or yearn for their coupling, and when I googled and found out that he was gay, I discerned that's why. There is a sense of maleness that a hetero man exudes that a homosexual man does not, and a woman cannot be swept away by someone acting as if. That is where the season falls short.",6
"Exceptional production, beautifully made...I read this books, and this adaptation did not disappoint.","I glanced at some of the reviews, and dismissed most.First, the casting was overall well done. The skin pigmentation is inconsequential as the actors embody the characters personalities. Focus on such things perpetuates identities linked to shades of skin rather than the content of ones character. Particularly impressive were Page's Simon and Dynevor as Daphne. They encapsulated the endearing romance and brought those characters to life. My only disappointment was that Page was not given the opportunity to bring forth further the anguish of the childhood struggle/speech impediment that sustained his fear of fatherhood and anger towards his father. This would have further developed his screen character. His portrayal of the duke's character was honest and honorable...but most of all, believable. Page actually surpassed any expectations I had for the casting of this character.Lady Danbury (Andoh) should also be given the opportunity for character development as her role within the novels is both a seamstress of matchmaking but along with that a wit unrivaled by other characters within the novel. Her banter displays her exceptional intelligence and insight.Anticipation for the next stories beautifully develops with the weaving of the characters throughout.Finally, the direction of the series seems to build in accordance with the book series with few exceptions. I look forward to Season 2, and I appreciate Netflix in its ability to seek out new opportunities for varied audiences.",10
Remarkably engaging let down,"To be clear, I watched the whole thing over 4-5 days, and never once quit and turned off my tv mid episode. That being said, the story is atrocious. None of the characters are likeable or have any depth whatsoever, which is fine cuz they're pretty. The real problem is that nothing HAPPENS. The end of the story is obvious from the opening scene and yet they draw out the inevitable hookup until the penultimate episode, not to maintain tension, but because there clearly wasnt anything else to fill the time. Which is odd, because there are enough additional characters, but somehow their stories also go nowhere. Still gets 6 stars because you can turn this on, sit down, and your brain will slowly unwind towards sleep.",6
Beautifully written,Beautifully written. Exceptional cast and excellent setting. I look forward to seeing season 2.,10
Lockdown fever,"I've put off watching this as the trailer was enough to stop me. Now the hype has died down, I had a rainy afternoon in lockdown to waste some time. It was so bad. The casting is ridiculous for this era. The acting is stilted, and has 21 century phrases thrown into the dialogue. I have not read the books, but from other reviews there is nothing to resemble them. They definitely owe their success to the ennui of the Pandemic.",6
Much better than expected!!!!,"After reading some reviews I expected some terrible woke, badly written and asinine story but after watching it I found this series quite delightful, interesting and engaging.Granted I have never read the books but I enjoyed pretty much all characters and story lines and the acting was quite good!I hope there will be more!",8
Fun and entertaining,"I didn't even know there was a series of books until I started reading the reviews and I do sympathize with those who are not happy with the adaptation... For me, it was fun, I like the characters and to be honest, it was refreshing to see a diverse cast on the screen. Yes, the costumes are gaudy and OTT but this isn't a documentary and was never meant to be. I disagree about the chemistry of the 2 main actors and find it very believable. Might want to look up Queen Charlotte's ancestry before throwing any more criticisms around about her appearance on the show. Was very interesting.",7
When Shonda Rhymes imagines herself being Julian Fellows ... and fails miserably.,"The first season was rather a soft porn movie, but the second one ...with cheesy lines and, in places, forced and false chemistry, is beyond bad. I would have got over the total historical inaccuracies (it is, in the end, a ""fantasy"" and that somehow should justify it all?!), the ""diversity"" that is being forced on our throats (just to show to everybody that she cares about the all the human typologies), thing which would have NEVER existed in the very conservative England of the 19th century (centuries of racism wiped out just by a ... royal marriage?, really?), the cheesy music made ""old"" (Madonna, again, really?!), but I could not get over about how silly and shallow the second season was, how its plot is simply insulting our intelligence.Where to start? The queen is rather a brothel madame who takes pleasure in who is getting together with whom, is more interested in reading gossip than in actually being the head of a country, laughs like a commoner and what a heck is with those RIDICULOUS wigs in 1813? Regency era was famous for its elegance and if Shonda wanted with any price to show in the series the morals of the time and the fashion, she should have done a better job.Then the main characters. Anthony is a bully, who doesn't know exactly what he wants from life (or imagines he knows), uses everybody with the scope of fulfilling his own goals. And we have to consider him charming and lovable, right?! Or to feel any kind of pity for him, because he had a trauma in his youth seeing his father killed by ... a bee? Kate is a stuck up girl, whose dedication for the whinny little sister borders the ridicule. And then she risks being ruined by having sex with the ""lovable"" Anthony in the gardens where anyone could have walked on them. And it goes on.The rest of the characters I would not bother, even though I liked Penelope and Violet Bridgerton.I never understood this need the American film makers have to take destroy everything European, imagining that somehow this will bring them success. Disney has been trying that for years (killing all the wonderful children stories), quite successfully, then were the countless American ""versions"" of successful european stories (Torchwood, Forbrydelsen and so one) and now comes madame Shonda and believes that by doing this series could reiterate the succes she had with Grey's Anatomy. 🙁She should have stuck to doctors and nowadays era. The historical movies are not for her, not even in the romance department.",1
LOVE this series!!,"I am a huge fan of the books and loved season 1!! The chemistry between Daphne and Simon is off the charts! I love the differences from the novel: the diverse cast, contemporary music, etc. Will watch over and over.",10
Perfect,"I'm in love. Bridgerton is perfect, seeing my favorite characters come to life was amazing. Looking forward to the second season",10
A refreshing understanding of complicated love but has its flaws.,"The intrigue of Bridgerton comes from its tangled ecosystem of friends, frenemies, suitors, and voyeurs. The most exciting moments often come not from scenes of bombast but in the whispers that shape the season. There are men in this story, all of whom are interesting and often deeply alluring, but this is a show most concerned with the plight and passions of women. It does not feel the need to force high-concept drama or unnecessarily soapy details into their lives to make them interesting. There are romps in the meadows, kisses in the rain, and meddling mothers at tea-time, and it is all executed with such delicate flair that Bridgerton makes the usual fresh again. This is not just a show that takes its own concept seriously: It's one that respects the romance genre as a whole, and I cannot tell you how much of a relief it is to see that, especially given how widely ignored or derided romance novels are by the cultural mainstream. Van Dusen has enough trust in both his source material and the very concept of a Regency romance saga. The show gives every character in this vast ensemble room to breathe and the attention their unique plights deserve.
Creator Van Dusen makes Bridgerton's many twists and turns satisfying to the end, even when they're predictable, and the young cast of mostly unknowns brings zip and depth of feeling to material that could otherwise feel slight. There's a charming wink to it all - this is a show that knows exactly what it is, and wears its corset proudly.",
fun period-piece soap opera,"This fun piece of nonsense gives us fancy costumes, spatting lovers, gossip and mystery as it follows a spicy romance and various other romances, nomances, and romances-gone-bad.While I really enjoyed this series, I was getting a bit sick of it towards the end of the season. But that may not have been the series' fault. My girlfriend insisted on watching 1-2 episodes per night and Bridgerton is really a show I would have liked to space out a little. Still, it's fun and worth checking out.",7
Spectacular,Coming from a woman's point of view this show is very captivating to a little girl who is trying to find herself in a man's world. This show gives hope to us women whom are stuck in a life that we seem trapped. It is a brilliant well put together and I hope the director is ready to put out an amazing scandalous second season.,10
More Jackie Collins than Jane Austen,"This should not be classified as a historic drama nor is it a historic romance. This is pure romance novel set in a environment somewhat inspired by Victorian Britain.
Seen in that light it is entertaining - although formulaic and predictable. It makes the Victorian era much more racy and racially diverse than it was, so don't look for historic accuracy, but if you come for a love story between two beautiful young actors that both do the material justice then you might enjoy it.
The main story is classic romance novel - two young people use each other to get out of their respective problems and unintended romance ensues - but it is well acted and the two lead actors have great chemistry.
The modernized sensibilities of Bridgerton gives us a raunchier and funnier world than is typical for period dramas, but it has less depth than most such shows possess. This is to Downton Abbey what teen vampire novels are to Bram Stokers Dracula. If that offends you, then don't watch it.",6
Spare art from politics please..,"IMDb editors should edit out the politically motivated reviews... Is the series worth 1 star, no definitely not.. does it compete with downtown Abbey, no.. it's one of the most escapism driven drama.. enjoy it..",9
Gossip Girl Vibes.,"It's a one time watch. Acting is decent.
The Narrator sounds like Gossip Girl.",7
Wonderful Show!,"I love the culture, costumes and cast!I enjoy the storyline and believe the show will continue to do great.Check your racism at the door! Stop trying to make everything black and white - judge the show on the acting and true storyline.",10
"Another ""worthless without a man"" story","Terrible and boring storyline with one dimensional characters. Even the female characters with some agency are bland and unlikeable. Could hardly get through the first episode which didn't matter because it was highly predictable.Furthermore, what is with weird diverse casting? I applaud the show for casting black actors, but why only the fairest? Were the producers like ""we want diversity, but not too much""? If that's the direction you want to take a show, then why no Asian or disabled characters?It's just another awful show from Netflix that adds nothing of value.",7
Far below downtown abbey,The fact that this drama need a lot of adult scenes to boost the views said it all. Shallow stories and plot. Nothing like it was supposed to be in the timeline of the story.There i said it.,1
Wow... the righteous indignation in these reviews,"I enjoyed this show a lot. It gave me an opportunity to escape from reality for a while, and to imagine a slightly different past. I don't understand what is so wrong with that. Oh and I'm not a ""millennial"" despite so many people on here claiming with disdain that the show will only appeal to millennials. Ok boomers, go back to watching your duck dynasty then and let others have Bridgerton.",8
AN OLD FASHION LOVE STORY.,"I am extremely dissappointed with the reviews I've read.
First, and most importantly, this a FANTASY story set in London around 1816. They want you to feel what it was to live in those times. The command of the English language is extraordinary, I teach English and Spanish, and will recommend for my students. And yes, for many it might sound ridiculous, but if you know Byron, you will understand. The use of modern music is just a methaphore, who cares?
Black people in those times? Of course is not true, but as I said before is a FANTASY story.
Open your mind to the colours, settings and the feel of London, a place that it was my city for many years and is very close to my heart.",10
Should have been better as a movie,Shondaland ruined historical romance in this adaptation of Julia Quinn's Bridgerton. With 8 long episodes of wokeness.Julia Quinn's Bridgerton book series could be adapted with one movie for each brother and sister. But it's never enough for Shondaland. It needs to have all political agenda in it. A simple love story in Shonda Rhimes's hands can turn into something political.Shonda Rhimes must stay away from any book adaptation and create her own original story with her own original characters.,
New Series Netflix,Bit far fetched but glorious in its costumes and settings,7
Perfect escapism,"This show is brilliant!! I'm really shocked how many bad reviews there are. I don't think people understand that it's not supposed to be historically accurate in any way! It's pure escapism which is exactly what's needed right now. Brilliant cast, brilliant costumes, the dialogue is great, witty and funny, and I LOVE the modern music reimagined in string.
If you have an open mind and half an imagination, you'll love this!",9
Season 2: Is this a different director and who wrote the lines??,"Season 1 was a solid 9/10. I don't know WHAT was going on with the 2nd season but it felt very B rated for quality. I still enjoyed it but there were some big differences in strength for this season that dare I say made it a bit boring. I absolutely loved the new characters Kate, Edwina and Mary. I thought they were all beautiful and fantastic editions. However, unfortunately the majority of the acting Kate and the Viscount had to be with facial expression. He was absolutely amazing. Made you catch your breath. The actress for Kate had a harder time relaying desperate emotion, though she frowned between her eyes a lot.What was with the directing? They made them say ""You vex me"" way too many times, when the I Love Yous came out it was bland and casual - not like the climactic moments of the 1st season. The green screens were AWFUL which was a huge surprise. But biggest disappointment was every single episode, they had them rub faces, then NO WE MUSTN'T! Rub faces, then 'wretch herself away. Over and over. And a hugely overused amount of times that she happened to be caught alone by him. It wasn't about the lack of sex, it was the directing and the writing that wasn't very good. Even the things Edwina was saying to Kate when she was mad didn't make sense. Their whole argument - or hers rather - seemed forced and didn't match up.If the next season is made with more effort and they pay better attention to camera angles, I'm sure it will be back to fantastic again. 2nd season however didn't feel like anyone in charge threw themselves into it.",6
Outstanding!,"I cannot tell you how much I actually love this show. It's my new all time favorite. Every episode had me hooked it is truly worth it the watch and please ignore the first reviews, who knows what they were watching, it wasn't Bridgerton, that's for sure!The characters/actors were absolute perfection! Especially loved ELOISE.",10
Season 3 is tiresome,"I've rated this series overall a 7 because of so many positive attributes. It's clear that many have put in lots of hard work to put this series into production.I can even look past that every dress has an empire waist because that is the most flattering and how every female character in this show is more than likely trying to secure a husband. It would just be nice to see a tad bit of variety in this space. Otherwise, so much of the plot is ridiculous.I absolutely loved season 1, but I found season 2 a little more of a struggle. The actors did their job, and the numerous others, but it just didn't have the tit package for me. Despite that, I've stuck with it and yet somehow it just doesn't quite fit. I can't put my finger on it exactly because everyone involved does a super job. Season 3 continues along those lines, but ultimately I find there are so many reasons to continue watching this series and I especially love period dramas.I am glad this show exists, albeit some flaws.",6
So much love for this programme,"Love love loved this programme! I haven't read the books so have nothing except the tv version to judge and I found after the first couple of episodes I was hooked. I really cared about the characters and their different trials and tribulations. Particularly the mystery behind Lady Whistledowns identity, Loved Simon and Daphne and their story. Loved the costumes, the colours, the sheer escapism in these grim times. I don't get all the haters and snobs calling it trash... I just found it a delight from start to finish and I can't wait for the next season!",10
Fantasy for keeping denial in kidults,"This tv series wanna be included in that new trend of denying history to make the new generations of kidults (or snowflakes) happy cos the true version of acts would be too harsh for their made-of-glass psyche.The series shows England in the verge of the Georgian era in which black people are a part of the GENTRY, what obviously is a historical untruth. It's one of the leftist new trend of history revision and we can see here a practical application of that peculiar mindset.It might be hard to accept but unfortunately that time wasn't a period of blessed tolerance, diversity and inclusiveness. Instead of being a snowflake & kidult who is unable to accept the harsh historical reality, it would be better to learn sth from previous eras to avoid such situations in our future what would also be in line with a well-known Latin saying - historia magistra vitae.Nevertheless, to be honest and fair about that movie story, I must say that its plot can be pleasing many people who do like all period drama movies.It contains (at least in season one) a mystery which is developed slowly but still gives fun of watching the series.",7
Who would watch without the explicit scenes? And without permanent advertising?,"I was open to everything with Jane Austen. A lot of money has been invested in the equipment and advertising. But I find the actors without fire, just a beautiful face is not enough to make the attraction believable. The erotic scenes only served to attract attention, but the chemistry between the actors is not right.the weak acting performances ultimately caused the series to bore me. Despite a lot of tailwind, the result is not bad but not as outstanding as it should be with the effort that all sides have made. I did not recommend this series.",1
Binge-worthy Regency Drama,"I absolutely loved Bridgerton! The costumes were gorgeous and colorful. I enjoyed how they took modern songs and arranged them to sound like classical pieces. If you watch period pieces, you will recognize some of the beautiful locations that were used. The acting was well done, and the storyline was interesting. For me, it ticked all of the boxes that make a period piece enjoyable. It was like a cross between a spiced-up Jane Austen and Gossip Girl. Enjoy it for its entertainment value, not its historical accuracy. It's not meant to be a documentary. I became so immersed in the story that the actors could have been purple and I wouldn't have noticed. I am eagerly awaiting Season 2! I highly recommend Bridgerton!",10
BRILLIANT AND TIMELY,"I LOVE it. I see so many reviews complaining that this adaptation isn't true to the books and some references to issues of race, complaining of political correctness.Whilst I am a lover of literature and deeply love many books, I'm mostly happy with this adaptation. That said, I am very hard on adaptations of my favorite book, Jane Eyre. So I'll own my hypocrisy here.I LOVE the casting. There is real chemistry between the actors and the characters are entirely believable. I love the racial diversity. If we are going to be historically accurate regarding race, only Whites can play these characters. Ever. I find that disturbing. Why shouldn't we have different races playing these beloved characters? This is an adaptation! I'm White, of British heritage, born in 1954 America, and have watched with my heart breaking whilst racial issues continue to roil. I don't like seeing Black actors only get roles as servants, slaves, or sharecroppers - downtrodden and poor - in historical pieces.My only complaint, and this may be simply my age, is that there's more sex than I care to see. The kissing Foley (sounds) in film is like chalk screeching on a chalkboard to me. So I skipped ahead during those scenes. I am NOT bothered by interracial sex scenes - just didn't care for the duration of those scenes in the same way I wouldn't like it if all players were White. It's just not my thing.I LOVE the writing, the casting, the energy, the chemistry, the directing, the costumes, the cinematography - ALL of it. Love it. It's a brilliant adaptation - and ADAPTATION. Not a perfect replication.It's wonderful.",10
"7.4 out of 10, no way.","Just look at the actual written reviews and it's 1, 2, or 3 out of 10.Yet another show with a paid campaign. By the time you read this I am sure this score will drop.",
Not as good as the first season.,"Bridgerton: Season 2 on Netflix was a bit hard to watch. The Bridgerton family had set up either eldest to marry the jewel lady crowned by the queen. The storyline look a turn for the worst, dragging most of the time. Unlike the first season that was more appealing, this season the families spent more time trying to get the Sharmas to marry the wrong girl. Love did not come into play till the very end of the season. Lord Bridgerton played the gentleman card every time he got close to the right Sharma he loved. I mean come on already, we all knew they were going to end up together. I would not recommend this season but the music, beauty and the surrounding were one of a kind. Hopefully next season will be better.",6
Stick more to the books! And stop Mondrich family story... no one cares,"I love the books and I understand the tv can be different but please, there are so many interesting interactions between c more intrestint characters than Mondrich family, no one care for them really, eveeyone judt past forwards their scenes, it doesnt add anything to the main stories, that is judt Netflix being 'inclusive' or what?In general i love all the bridgerton siblings stories, specially Collin's and Francesca, ypu could had more minutes even for Benedict or Anthony's...
Also seeing Collin so much as a night guy snd likes the ladys of the nights was a bit disgusting more than once, unnecessary I would say.",8
"""Gossip Girl"" in alternative history Victorian times","That's pretty much it.If you liked Gossip Girl, if you like period pieces, and you like a ""woke"" version of alternative history, where people of colour and alternative sexuality are held in high regard, and afforded all the rights and privileges they did not have in real history, this is most definitely the show for you, and you will love it.Otherwise it's a ""meh"" show, that only just tops mediocrity, because of all the secondary qualities like costumes, score, locations and such being excellent, while the primary qualities of directing, script and acting are very mediocre indeed.I for one will be giving season 2 a miss, and only watched season 1 because of Covid.",6
Love it!,"We have all seen movies or tv shows that are based on our favorite books/series. Some have been horrible: Flowers in the Attic, Montana Sky or any other of the Nora Roberts books, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, The Hunger Games. I could go on but you get my point. As I watch Bridgerton, I am enjoying the similarities and differences from the book series. I think the diverse cast makes the show all the more interesting. The actors and actresses do a great job of telling the story, Daphne and Simon have great chemistry. The whole cast is wonderful. True fans of Julia Quinn and Shondaland will appreciate the great performances. Looking forward to additional seasons.",10
Just roll with it,"Don't expect historical accuracy, just roll with it as a fantasy Regency world and you'll be entertained!I'm someone who can be irritated by the too obvious in your face wokeness and political correctness but in this case it didn't bother me at all. Yes there are people of colour playing it it. Does it matter to the story? NO.It's mainly a show about romance. There. If you don't want to watch something like it, just don't, but do not leave sour comments just because you don't like to see coloured people in a regency show or without having seen the whole thing. And btw in the theater coloured people have also been playing ""white"" roles and that has been accepted as normal.Okay I could write a whole essay about the issue above but I'll now give a review about the show itself. The showmakers don't claim to have made a historical accurate show. It is good they have done that because it really is modern. Maybe a tad too modern for my taste, but oh well they wanted to reach a wide enough audience...
As a ""fan"" of the Bridgerton books I am happy with how they adapted the books. It's not entirely the same and it shouldn't be.There's not enough story in the books to carry a tv-show.You can tell a lot of work and care has gone into production design. The show looks great!I show was lighthearted with some heavy elements and for me the balance of this was just right.The main romance is executed well enough as you can expect from this genre.The acting itself is good, the actors did as well as they could've done!Jonathan Bailey playing Anthony Bridgerton is maybe for me the most outstanding role as he seems to have a more complex personality. A surprise to me was Ruby Barker playing Marina Thompson! She could acted her funny and heavy moments out with ease. And Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington was also an eye-catcher for me. Her portrayal was spot on.However some elements of the show could've been fleshed out a bit better I suppose. But these kind of shows are almost always lacking a bit of depth.The show is great at what it tries to be so just enjoy it as it is! A solid 8 from me (I would've given it a 7.5)",7
Diversity is a welcome,"I see people crying here that 18th century London was as white as white could be and they have given rating 1 without watching more than one episode (written clearly in their review, thus actually they are unfit to review this ) but as racism is filled in their mind they are saying let the history be accurate when the story is BASED ON NOVEL NOT HISTORY!!!!!!!!I liked the story and beautiful cast and by the way I have seen half the season",8
"Excellent Season1, Disappointing Season2","Season1 was stunning and the depth of emotions were like a painting. Season 2, however, couldn't match the previous season. The story wasn't weaved properly in season 2, and the scenes for the Viscount and miss Sharma were cringeworthy.",7
Walt Disney approach on Regency era,"I think American producers should stop making shows set in a European time or place, it's an insult to the whole continent. Anyone with a pinch of knowledge on English history or literature will find this show ridiculous. The dialogoues are overwritten, yet shallow, characters annoying, costumes are weird for the era (like everyone wears corsets, but the dresses show no waistline), I'm no expert on historical dressing, but I'm almost entirely sure that none of the costumes are even close to their time. This is a very soapy and very wrong take on a period where title and wealth was everything and rigid rules determined the life of upper class. I wouldn't be aginst pretend history if it was funny or entertaining, not just putting different races and sex scenes in the show. This era was nowhere near how they depict it, but for this much distortion it's boring and shallow. It really is like a teen (or American) version of Downton Abbey.",1
Exquisite,"I've only gotten to episode 3, but it has so effectively pulled me in, I had to pause to review. It reminds me of what an injustice it is that there are no physical markers of heartbreak - no bruises or scars - to keep a record of our agony when we love and lose. It's poignant and painful and artfully acted and positioned to elicit this sort of mournful, relatable feeling.More broadly, I highly recommend it for its fantastic costumes, decor, colour, and cinematography/lighting. Just absolutely brilliant. I love the diversity of characters, perspectives, and internal voices surfacing with consistency but still there is evolution. Just a remarkable show.PS, if you are looking for a new netflix boyfriend, Regé-Jean Page will do the job admirably. He's dashing in such a striking way, I audibly said, ""Wow,"" on more than one occasion.",10
A star is born and his name is Regé-Jean Page!,"Never read the book but I do love a good historical drama. I haven't seen anything good lately in this genre so I am probably one of the last people to see this. In fact the last few I saw were so boooooorrrrriiiiinnnng.I do not like modern twists on historical dramas BUT I LOVE THIS ONE!
I love the mixing in POC! Awesome! Made me watch beyond the first episode because this was finally interesting. THEN you really got me with , Regé-Jean Page! WOW Where has he been hiding?I have been wondering for years who was gonna replace Denzel, Bradd Pitt and Antonio Banderas for the upcoming generations and now I know! Regé-Jean Page!
I am now looking for everything he is in! I have to see all his work! He is amazing! Not just a beautifully virile, handsome man but a STAR! This guy is a STAR and I cannot wait to see what he is going to do next.This entire series was well cast, AMAZING SETS, hair costume! well written, WELL DONE!! I cannot sing its praises enough!!! And I cannot sing the praises of Regé-Jean Page enough. Every scene he was in riveted me. Once I saw him I binged watched the show and even watched a few scenes repeatedly! You know the ones ladies!A star is born and his name is Regé-Jean Page!",10
Next time it'll be white Nelson Mandela in biography drama from fairyland,"No... just no. This is not good in two spheres. First of all story is totally stupid... I mean reaaaaly stupid. But, that's not the true reason why we are here right?
I red argument that because showrunners said it goona be this wierd just before, we are not allowed anymore criticised that. WT*?
If they proclaimed it's gonna be laim and boring, we will not to be allowed say it's boring and lame? That's not an argument, that's alibism...Nobody reasonable don't wanna see this and nobody wanna see white bushmens hunting zebra with spears... both would be/is rude, offensive and unsuitably",
Appreciating original ideas,"Browsing Netflix, my husband told me that this seems to be the lemonade series that I am occasionally interested in. So I watched it. And then read the book, and watched it again with that in mind.All in all, I liked to series a lot, more than the book itself.
The creators did an exceptional job with the series. I love an original idea in books, films and series, when I feel that someone actually put the work into creating something creative and unique. And in my mind, Bridgerton has 2 great, original ideas.
First is the involvement of Afro-American aristocracy. I understand that in our PC world it might be too much for some people, but for me it shows me that someone was actually thinking about a message that this show would broadcast and backed it up with a theory, that for me is really creative and makes a difference.Second original idea is the whole combination of regency-era and modern world. It was a catchy atmosphere, I didn't mind the modern color-scale, music and ambiance at all. It was a really unique setting, which altogether created a bright, colorful, sort of dreamy atmosphere that was consistent throughout the 8 episodes. I loved it.I became a fan of both the lead actor and actress as well.
After watching it first, I was in instant awe of Phoebe Dynevor. She did a really good job with Daphne's role. She was beautiful on screen, the character seemed innocent, but had a genuine curiosity and intelligence. I felt all her feelings instantly. Daphne's character was a bit more witty and funny in the book, I missed it a bit from the show.
I had to watch it the second time to appreciate Regé-Jean Page. Of course, he was sexy and fit well into the character at first as well, but I really didn't get the depths of Simon's character at first. The second time I was paying more attention on his expressions and realized some ""less in the face"" scenes, where I started to get it. For example, the concert scene, when he realizes that Daphne is not expecting a child, and it was visible in his expression that he secretly wanted it, wanted to stay with his wife, and now he has no other choice than leave.However, I really wished for a bit more character development in both Daphne's and Simon's role. Showing more of how Daphne becomes a mature duchess knowing what she wants, having values and supporting and leading the community (for example I really liked how she stood up for the Featherington's after the pregnancy scandal). Same goes for Simon, here the character development was even less tangible, I didn't see the struggle and the process of how he went from not wanting to get married and have child to actually being married and having a child at the end.The ending felt rushed for me. I absolutely did not get the solution. ""You stay, we do this together and nothing else matters."" This didn't make sense for me. I could use a bit more insight, or an additional 20 min, showing the doubt in Simon or showcasing how he is dealing with this obviously big decision. Specifically here I liked to book's ending more. There, after Simon commits himself to have a child, there is an extra scene where he is having second thoughts, and explains Daphne that he is afraid that his child will have the same difficulties with speaking.For me, some of the story lines seem to be unnecessary, or unnecessarily long, therefore the 1-hour long episodes were not justified in some cases, or could be used to elaborate more on fewer characters' life.",7
LOVED IT!,"I was a bit wary of this show given the poor reviews, but I absolutely loved it! It's obviously not a show that requires much thinking, but it's entertaining if you can get past the inaccuracies of the show. It's not meant to accurately reflect the Regency period, it's more just for show. The characters are likeable and easy to watch, and there is enough drama to keep you watching. It's the TV equivalent to a trashy romance novel, but with bright visuals and a slightly more elaborate script. Definitely give it a go if you're after something entertaining (as opposed to intellectual) to watch.",10

Wonderful,"Halfway through I already fell in love with this show. The characters are beautifully chosen and I like their acting. The story is light but yet entertaining.I haven't read the books so can't say anything about accuracy, but most of this downrating reviews can't barely hide their racism.In this show I feel that it doesn't matter which colour we are and it's a nice thought, that history had gone the way it's told here.Well done Shonda! And haters gonna hate ...",10
The Fashion,"Just seen season 2; the fashion is so boring, the dresses are all the same, just different fabrics. For a period drama, I prefer the mens clothing, it's seems to be more interesting than the women.",6
"Lovely Fluff Show, Amusing and Fun","All the people complaining about the unrealistic casting, and historical inaccuracies failed to understand that this is a fictional story, a fictional place, and is not supposed to be historically accurate. It's not based on any real people. It was exactly as it was supposed to be. It was a show with beautiful costumes, part period piece, part fairy tale, an insight about how women were treated, and what was expected of them. It also showed some going their own way. I thought it was a lovely show. It was fun, and didn't take itself too seriously.If you want Jane Austin and a historical accuracy, there are plenty of those around. Bridgerton never claimed to be that, so it's not fair to compare them.",8
"Brilliant music, great cast","The music and the harmony between the two leads makes this such a pleasure to watch. Entire cast has been selected in scrutiny . The two leads are not really brilliant actors but together they are brilliant. In the "" burning for you scene"" watching the two of them was like watching a tennis game in acting. I am afraid these two they have set the standards too high chemistry- wise , and I suspect rest of the series will measure up to this. The ball scenes were lovely , every detail carefully thought. I also enjoyed the sense of humour throughout the script. The music complements and enhances the mood throughout the series in such a great way that it deserves an Emmy. Curious why only Rege Jean- Page was nominated for best lead though, why not Phoebe Dynevor? Please consider a spin- off series on the Duke and Duchess with same leads.",7
Something is Lost in Translation,"I watched Season 1 & Season 2, but to be honest, I quit watching now after first episode of Season 3. Something drastically changed in Season 3. Yes, backdrops and costumes are beautiful, but the acting? It quite literally is lacking. When they're speaking, it doesn't even seem like they're in the time period, just reading lines 'trying' to be in an older era. And when the one couple were in bed, it could've been any show you were watching. Come one, don't 'modernize' it if it's supposed to be in a totally different time. I was quite bored through the whole thing. Get some people that can actually act for the time period your show is portraying. Certainly don't need to see anymore. I just didn't care to even watch the whole episode let alone the rest of the season. I have better things to do with my time, thank you.",3
"A sweet, entertaining confection","I enjoyed every moment of this lovely series. It is pure escapism. It is beautifully casted, sexy and fun. I hope there will be more of it in the future. It is wonderful to see beautiful actors of color given the oppurtunity to show their stuff in a period piece like this. I loved it.",10
Great writing,I read all the books and the writing for this series was very well done. The acting was on point t and well done. I can't wait for season 2.,8
"So boring, even your pets leave the room",Still wondering what the story was.This period drama should be listed under comedy for turn of the characters and their destinies.,
Chill Out - Good Diversion During Darkest Days in US,"No worse than the average rom-com and, in fact, better than most. So it's not historically accurate because there is a diverse cast! I don't recall a preface that it was based on a true story. Nor is that the greatest travesty ever. Just chill out! The Pride and Prejudice type plot is interesting, Simon is FINE as hell! The show gets a 10 just for his looks alone. Great costumes, okay acting, and a wonderful diversion during some of America's darkest days. I couldn't ask for more.",7
Season 2 is even better,"I quite like this show due to the diverse nature of it. It provides a glimpse into a parallel history.I thought season 1 was okay but felt it lacked chemistry between the love interest. However, season 2 is wonderful. Give it a watch.",9
Delightfully refreshing,"Watch it for what it is, pure entertainment. This is not a history show, why judge it as such. I loved it so much that when it came to the end, I re-watched immediately. I love each of the characters and can't wait for more.
People are so fickle. I'm not in to horror, therefore I wouldn't watch half an episode and rate it poorly. I'd simply go watch what I enjoy and leave it to the horror fans to give a genuine rating.",10
Entertaining enough.,"One gets used to the diversity of the cast. But, I am waiting for Mel Gibson to be cast as Martin Luther King.Maybe it will grow on me, but so far pretty lame.Beautiful wardrobe and scenery.",7
Bridgestone brought to life!,"I loved the series from Julia Quinn. Shonda Rhimes' reimagined characters, beautiful and realistic settings makes for an extremely entertaining series. Thank you Netflix for this Christmas present! And thanks for the diversity. Excellent acting all-around! Looking forward to Season 2.",10
Not My Cup of Tea,The cinematography is excellent. The actors are brilliant. But....This is not historical fiction; it is a spoof on high English society.Not my cup of tea...,6
Walmart version of Downton Abbey,"I was actually looking forward to this show as the trailers looked promising. That promise was not fulfilled. I found the story choppy, the characters cardboard cutouts and some of the acting very bad. No passion and no life. I always saw the actors and never the characters. I was never allowed to lose myself in the story and feel anything for the characters.So much lost potential.",3
Worth a look,"I enjoyed this series. Downton it isn't, but still watchable. Other reviewers have commented on casting but this is not historical fact - it is a STORY, a fiction that happens to be set in the early 19 th century. As such, characters can be whomever the author chooses. I'm looking forward to the next series.",9
Second Season Dragged,"Season two was interesting. However, it dragged seven episodes between the love pair. It was annoying to watch the constant back and forth. I almost became uninterested by episode six. The love pair started to feel redundant. However, I felt the need to finish the story. After finishing, I only wished there was more depth in other love stories with other characters as well. Season two was a tad disappointing!",8
Absolute rubbish,"It's a parody of an historical drama, without drama, humour or any redeeming feature at all. Julie Andrews is embarrassing. Even the sex scenes are so coy as to be a turn-off. The two leads might have potential if they appear in something else that takes itself a little bit more seriously.",
"Love the colourfull cast! It makes me see people, not race.","The show itself is quite boring, however I really like the colourful cast - at first it's strange, since it's a period drama, bet strangenesses goes away quickly. And then I am seeing just actors, not their colour.We shouldn't be surprised if we see a black royal. Maybe it's not historically accurate, but we shouldn't be thinking that ""royal could never be black"". This opens our minds - the history could have been different.If we always portray royalty as whites, servants as blacks - it would stay so for longer. In our heads and in reality.",7
WELL DONE!!! I DIDN'T THINK OF COVID19 ONCE WHILE WATCHING,"I usually don't like romance movies or TV, but I really fell in love with Bridgerton! And all the romantic drama that came with it!!! What a marvelous storyline, actors and costumes. There are so many twists and turns in the plot that I was never bored... not even for a second. Well done!!! A must watch!!! I can hardly wait for season 2!!! Please hurry!!!",10
Six-Packs and Royals - Downton Abbey for Losers,"When you see a man with a six-pack and a finely combed lady, then you know: don't take it too seriously. The problem is, the show takes itself seriously. From costume to acting, it looks like a copy of Downton Abbey, unfortunately. A bit like TV films, but a little better in the end.",7
"This show surprised me as a lover of historical accuracy, how good actually is!","Bridgeton is at the same time historically inaccurate, and accurate as my title shows, but only if you place it in our universe. It is a reimagined 19th century England, or should I say even better it is as an alternative history of our universe. Bridgeton represents what could have been if black and Asian people were part of high society. It is Shonda Rhimes production and you ought to expect good drama, great acting, great music, brightness from the get-go, the costumes, and smart writing. Some will say is woke and politically correct, and if I followed those reviews I wouldn't have watched this delight. It has woke elements but surprisingly is very subtle, not out there and in your face. If you pass through the historical inaccuracies you will realize how everything matches from the actors to the acting to the overall story.
Now what I meant by my title is this, it is historically inaccurate in the representation of minorities as part of high society, somewhat the liberties of some characters in public which would have never happened in Regency era, the portrayal of the queen as a dweller in narcotics, etc. But it is accurate in the shapes of the costumes with a fantasy feel of it, the way they talked the balls the events everything else. The creator of this show presents what our world could have looked if racism didn't exist if all women and men were equal and society see them based on their standing rather than their color. It's a perfect world but also there are some imperfections in this world that reflect ours. I don't wanna dwell in the story, but it is a must-watch once you pass through the historical inaccuracy and take this either as a reimagining of our world or simply the alternative universe to ours , and you will enjoy it and you will ask for more, I mean its Shonda Rhimes and Shonda doesn't create garbage. I am against everything that feels forced, with hidden agendas like most of the moves and tv shows these days but trusts me this is not that kind of show, this is a show that entertains you as all shows must be, it provides an escape from the real world if only for a moment and you will definitely enjoy it.",10
Colourful in every sense!,"I knew this was going to be different when a classical piece played at the ball in Ep 1 was familiar, then I recognised it as ""Thank you, next"" by Ariana Grande. Inspired!The costumes are amazing, colourful and sumptuous. I read an interview where the costume designer praised the director's wish to give them free reign over the vision for the clothes, and it paid off brilliantly.The extremely diverse racial makeup of the cast is also innovative for a drama set in this period.It is no Pride and Prejudice but I'm enjoying it.",7
10/10,AMAZING SHOW! It's really captivating from beginning to end. I've been waiting for a good show to watch through all this madness in the world right now.,10
The 1800s turned upside down in wildly crazy fun way,"Let me start by saying this is so NOT my kind of show and I randomly started watching Season 1 just as the new season is about to begin. I binged the first season. Bridgerton is a modern day view of women saying, ""this is how we are treated and feel"" but taking the issues happening in the 2020s and shoving in the early 1800s in a time that actually treated women horribly and created humor and fun and slowly showing you how little women have progressed in over 200 years. The show mixes teen dramedy, mean girls, Harry Potter vibes with gossip columnist narration by Julie Andrews, with Cinderella predictable storylines, love sex and nudity and then writes about modern day issues but flops it into the 1800s Victorian, high society visuals that shouldn't work at all, but boarders on brilliant. What ties it all together is outstanding casting, colorful costumes and the race blind high society ""isshues"" and a script that finds clever ways to make fun of everything. For example, while high society people are waltzing across the floor to a beautiful orchestral number, the song sounded familiar. It was Madonna's Material Girl.",7
Netflix Torture Of English Regency Genre,"This is white trash meets Jane Austen. Applying american social decay to the English genre is just pure torture on the screen. Perhaps that is the idea, to make fun of the English Regency era with such absurd and obvious american mannerisms and ideas. Some might actually find that entertaining.",1
It's sexy and camp,"Bridgerton is the perfect show when you want to escape life and indulge in some drama. The girls that get it, get it.The backgrounds, costumes, hair and makeup, and coloring are so aesthetically pleasing. It makes me forget that I would be disgusted living in this time period where pads were actual diapers. Though, I'm easily swayed by the classical renditions of pop hits that are sprinkled throughout the episodes. Two hot, young people in a fiery love/hate romance ballroom dancing to a violin instrumental of Ariana Grande's Thank U, Next? More of that, please. I saw someone else's review that said this is Gossip Girl meets Jane Austen, and I think that's the perfect way to describe it. Fun, meaningless drama involving the rich!",9
Delightful nonsense,"Visually gorgeous and historically inaccurate, it is wonderful escapist nonsense.",8
Cringe,If you watch thus you'll get migraine for free. Just make it Stop.,
Decent period show,"As someone who isn't majorly into history and who's proffered genre definitely is not this, Bridgerton is rather difficult for me to review as I truthfully know nothing about the source material behind this show. With that being said I do happen to know a thing or two about the art of filmmaking and definitely appreciate the show for those technical aspects. The cinematography, set dressing, and costume designs all looks great! The shows writing is also not bad as it manages to carry out many different stories happening between many different characters at once without missing a beat. Speaking from the mindset of someone who knows little to nothing about this genre of filmmaking I found Bridgerton to be a decent period show.",6
In addition...,"...to my review, I just wanted to add that I wish I had a wisteria that bloomed for as long as the one on the Bridgerton house 😀",9
Season 2 is much better than season 1.,"Bridgerton season 2 was a lot less cringe than season 1, ladies if you like regency slow burn romance do check it out 😁. Season 2 is much better than season 1.",7
"Loved it, it is an alternate view of how things could have been","This show is not meant to be historically accurate, it is more like a Victorian era set in an alternate earth where diversity is part of the norm and I absolutely adored it, it is witty, funny and lighthearted, though still landing a dramatic punch. Absolutely worth a binge watch, and for people saying that it is not historically accurate I say shame on you for lacking the strength to imagine a different history, isn't it difficult to live with that rigid, dogmatic mindset of yours?",10
The Duke is a miss!,"Julia Quinn created a dream worthy, charming Duke in the book. The chemistry between Daphne and the Duke should be palpable! He is supposed to be dashing with blue eyes. I can't buy into this, there just isn't anything brooding about him. Zero chemistry, ZERO. Not off to a good start with this one...",7
Best period drama since Downtown Abbey,I have read some of the books that this series is loosely created from. The whole show is during the Regency period with the large difference of rather than being historically correct adds a twist of having Queen Charlotte being a woman of color and the regent than being German and Prince George being the regent. I respect how the writers despite the historical anachronism show that there was true love between George III and Queen Charlotte. If anyone likes romance novels based on the Regency period this show is for you,8
First scene is always tightening the dress,"No amazing plot. A very common ancient film on love line copying the style of Pride and Prejudice and Gone with the Wind.
Acting, costume and set up is all above standard. It is just like a mini Pride and Prejudice. If you are not a highly demanding audience it is still worth watching.",7
To Be Avoided At All Costs,"Bridgerton is a reimagining of Regency London and it deals with a young aristocratic woman looking for love and a financially adequate husband in her aristocratic circle. I was fooled by the trailer and yesterday I gave it a shot.Unfortunately I couldn't go through the first episode. Even as a ""reimagining"" of 19th century London, it is frivolous, caricatural and foolish. The plot is shallow and the acting unbearably overplayed. Since it doesn't have much to say, sex scenes are scattered here and there together with ridiculous dresses, vests, hairstyles and wigs. Dialogues seem to have been written under the influence of alcohol.The queen looks and behaves like a fishwife and as such receives her guests lying back in her throne in an overcrowded narrow room, which makes me wonder if anybody in the production has ever visited a Royal Palace.Even the opening credits are horrendous and badly made.Do yourself a favor and skip it.",1
"People of color or ""White"" - who care","If the actors are people of color or ""white"" totally don't care. They are people and they act good.It' historical not so right but they never said is true.I like the actors and the story.",9
Bah hum bug... to all you haters,I thought it was fabulous... just what I needed to delve in to a fantasy romance with wonderful Views of times past regardless of race or accuracy of events. It was a chance to escape CNN & Fox News as wel as these troubling times.,9
Phenomenal!!,Adore the series! Binged on the whole 8 episodes and hoping there is a season 2 (I've heard there is!) Some fantastic acting! Can see why it is no 1 pretty much all over the world! Just finished season 3 and whilst yes i enjoyed the previous 2 seasons this one! Couldn't take my eyes off the screen.. I think I have a soft spot for Eloise.. but fantastic ensemble!,
"The first two shows are abhorrent, but....","The Americanized version .. soap opera of British , Viscounts, Dukes and the line starts terribly. It almost is unwatchable. But I continued to watch it, discounting all the horrible reviews and trying to figure out why it is currently rated so highly, a 7.4. By the 5th episode I was hooked, the acting improved, the gaudy display lessened and it became very likable. I'm not a soap opera fan though I must admit in college I got hooked on general Hospital because of a girlfriend obsessed with it. This is much better and the story gets better as it goes along. Of course it's nothing new but in this Covid period when I have literally watched so many movies, even the movies I google under 'good flicks that I may not have seen' I found the later part of seasons one very watchable and I'm actually hoping there's a second season. Give it a try and reserve your comments until you've finished the first season. One things clear, all the 1 ratings come from those who turned it off during or after the first couple episodes. Worth the watch... it's certainly not 'The Avengers' lol nor is it near a 'Sense and Sensibility' but it's watchable.. so Ease up You British bores...it's not like your Royal hierarchy hasn't actually been laughable many times in history... this only shows it to be so.",7
Delightful Delicious .... binge watched. Want to watch again - n again .... Warning - some of the scenes are HOT n absolutely wonderful. 🙂😈🙂,"Delightful n Delicious - binge watch if at all possible - plan to watch it again n again - should come with a warning label - the Duke is HOT, has a great behind, wonderful eyes n expressive face n body - yep, defgonna watch n rewatch - n probably a few scenes rewind n repeat. Great period details. Loved the blended cast. Great series that should have wonderful future seasons!",10
"Sexy, unbelievable costumes and art direction","Watch it for what it is. A fantasy with beautiful cinematography, gorgeous interiors and sexy (adult) cast.That's it - period. It's not the History Channel.",7
"Fun, moving and addictive.","I don't normally like this type of show - on a whim I decided to watch the first episode to see what it was like. I was hooked. This show is not based on actual history - and shouldn't be taken so seriously. Beautiful gowns, lots of gossip and at times very touching. I'll admit to tearing up more than once. Please ignore the negative reviews and just watch 1 episode and judge for yourself. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea but it was certainly mine.",9
Another romantic saga,"I found it hard to believe that the events were taking place in the 19th centuries. I felt that the costumes were very fancy to that ""age"" and i felt the acting is more ""modern"". I don't know of this was intentional. However, the production is quite good even though we have seen that ""storyline"" before. A noble lady looking for a prestigious match when she falls in love with a handsome and rich duke of Hastings. He has complexes due to a firm father so she's the hero who's going to change me for the better.I really loved the idea that the Queen Charlotte is black and that many black actors are nobles. This was really nice taking into account the history of slavery and racism.In the end, it's fun to watch.",7
Give it a chance!!! It's ART - an interpretation,"This show is not meant to be a history lesson, but someone's alternate version. Initially, as a history lover, I was put-off by the historical inaccuracies of this show. HOWEVER, as a very loose interpretation of the books (that I've read), it's actually very good in it's own right.The show is extremely well-cast. Production quality is beautiful, and I've come to really enjoy it. The historical inaccuracies actually make for additional subject matter that I find extremely tasteful and fresh. Enjoy it for what it's worth -ART!!",9
Barbara Cartland movie!,"As long as you realize that it's fine. I thought it would be more witty, more sparkling like the new Emma movie which was quite quirky. I kept expecting it to have more of a contemporary spin. But its predictable tosh! And heroine looks insipid, not sure why she called an incomparable when she is so timid!Nice sets, lovely dresses shame about the plot...",7
this is just not jane austen,"The miscast cast (which is already common on netflix) makes this show almost a parody of so unreal LOL and to make matters worse it has bad acting and bad plot lines that are just plain silly and lack any depth don't waste your time watching this nonsense that has nothing ""british"" and even less jane austen!",1
period dramas,"I enjoyed it a lot. the acting and everything, good to find a good show during this year",9
Season 2!,"Season 1 was okay, but season 2 was amazing.The chemistry between the two leads was truly palpable! Not only that, the story was nice, and loved the backstories. Great acting, and the costumes are lovely.",10
"Scripts and books, literature is not the seventh","I did not have the pleasure of meeting the related queen bee in words,
Although the series is not void of lovely sentences, with true literary value,on the contrary I very much appreciate the opportunity of hearing those words, thoughts, dialogue, and the mastery of the narrator.
Love scenes were ""normal"" , as I, usually, in many cases, facing abnormal fabricated behavior fast forward them... these passed as those real life has presented me, considering the epoch. So it is a positive experience of good takes, dialogues, art.
Stories as this are the fabric of a type of literature that transcends genres.
Beeing able to bring it to screen and take an old, experienced viewer and critic to its happy tears, falling slowly off his cheek, more than the sad little tears that real man also drop, was an unexpected pleasure.
Drama, adversity, naiveté, social constraints, love and pain, ilusion and delusion, what more to that stuff that dreams are made of?
I see clearly a good thing to say about Bridgeton,
Congratulations for bring us an object of that world called good cinema ou TV, in an age where we see the intersection of them both.
Congratulations for not spending my time with monetization and infantile attempts to shock and held the tent of a circus, as many unfortunate do.
Good ensemble.
Say different, I have my delusions filled already with some absurd criticism I was presented here in Imdb, here and there.
You are wrong. This is good work. Art.",
Dear Readers - Don't miss this Delightful Romp,"My Review - "" Bridgerton ""
Mr Rating 9/10As Lady Whistledown would write ""Dear Reader"" this reviewer is always willing to reevaluate a previous first impression if circumstances present themselves.My first impression and it was only a brief look at the Netflix hit series Bridgerton did not entice me to explore further.However when I read that Dame Julie Andrews had the key spoken but unseen role of narrator Lady Whistledown a Regency Society Gossip columnist I wanted to explore it again and I'm so glad I did. Julie Andrews voice is perfect much deeper and commanding than 20 years ago when she was so wonderful in another regal role as Queen Clarisse Renaldi in The Princess Diaries she narrates the series and becomes a vital characters so necessary , although sight unseen .The two key romantic characters in Season 1 Regé -Jean Page as Simon Basset the Duke of Hastings and Phoebe Dynevor as Daphne Bridgerton are both beautiful and handsome in appearance and their intriguing tale and on again off again courtship and pretend court romance really got me interested.More a ""Comedy of Manners ""than a ""Comedy of Errors ""Bridgerton has a true originality about and doesn't pretend to be historically accurate or try to compete or compare with Jane Austen's Period novels . It's a world of the privileged few and totally indulged it occurred to me that this this Foreign world of upper class immorality is caught in a beautiful Snowglobe that blocks out the everyday mundane events of the real world but still swirls around with Drama and intrigue.The characters are all interesting we have the Dowager Viscountess Violet Bridgerton mother of eight children four boys and 4 very flowery daughters Daphne, Hyacinth, Eloise and Francesca ( what happened to Daisy?)
There's also a mysterious cousin and disgraced ward Marina Thompson (Ruby Barker ) who's dragged kicking and screaming to the filthy streets of London by Portia, Baroness Featherington to witness what her life will become if she doesn't marry in haste to the first eligible bachelor who asks her whether old, ugly, or with an infirmity he just requires a pulse.There's some delightful moments in Bridgerton I especially loved the ""Regency Speed Dating "" scenes where Daphne Bridgerton the ""Jewel of the Season "" ordained by Queen Charlotte regally and disdainfully played by Golda Rosheuvel is called on by every eligible bachelor at court and presented with floral extravaganzas and protestations of affection.My two favourite characters are the dashingly handsome Regé-Jean Page as Simon Bassett, Duke of Hastings one of London's most eligible bachelors who famously refuses to marry also his mentor, Lady Danbury played superbly by Adjoa Andoh . The Duke is determined not to marry for ancestral reasons and plots with Daphne to secure his bachelordom and her a suitable marriage.The ""colour blind "" casting when I first watched a brief episode of ""Bridgeton"" months ago took me a while to adjust to.I thought it seemed a little ridiculous but I've done a full 360 degree turn about as the series is pure fantasy and a very colourful fantasy at that .I now think the colour blind casting adds so much to this series and like Lin-Manuel Miranda's ""Hamilton "" I found myself totally ignoring the fact after a while .There is no reason I could see why the characters should come from a certain ethic group even Queen Charlotte who is based on Mad King George's spouse seems perfectly cast in Golda Rosheuval who was born in Guyana.I read each Episode of Bridgerton cost $7 million to produce and you can see why in each lavish episode . The sets by Production designer WillHughes-Jones set designer Gina Cromwell and its four costume designers John Glaser ,John Norster, Ellen Mirojnick and Sophie Canale are truly stunning. The artificial flowers alone must have cost a Kings ransom I haven't seen as many since the sets on ""Desperate Housewives"" especially the Wisteria.......
I'm pleased to see the popularity of the first season of ""Bridgerton."" has seen the series commissioned for a further 3 series . The Producers certainly have a wealth of story lines to work on as the series is based on the 8 books by Julia Quinn.Perhaps I hope ""Dear Reader.""we may even see ""Lady Thistledown "" make an appearance hopefully in the form of Dame Julie Andrews ?The second series is currently being filmed and will feature some of the fabulous locations of Series One including Bath, York, and Chatham. The grounds of Wilton House were used for Hyde Park and the grounds of Somerley were used for Hampstead Heath The Ranger's House in Greenwich, southeast London was used for the Bridgerton House exterior and Halton House at RAF Halton in Buckinghamshire for the interior. Talk is the next series will further the storyline of Lord Anthony Bridgerton the youngest son played by Jonathan Bailey.The series music Score is also very effective and appropriate written by John Debney who co wrote ""The Greatest Showman ."" and the ""Jungle Book."" 2016.I thoroughly enjoyed the entire first series of this bawdy irreverent Regency romp it's more like Henry Fielding's Eighteenth Century ""Tom Jones.""than Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice "" and its a truly original concept in many ways.An update from Lady Whistledown .""Dear Readers, while all eyes turn to Lord Anthony Bridgerton's quest to find a Viscountess, we bid adieu to Regé-Jean Page, who so triumphantly played the Duke of Hastings,"" the message began.""We'll miss Simon's presence onscreen, but he will always be a part of the Bridgerton family,"" it continued. ""Daphne will remain a devoted wife and sister, helping her brother navigate the upcoming social season and what it has to offer - more intrigue and romance than my readers may be able to bear.""",6
Absolutely glorious!,This show is amazing! If you've read the books then you understand the importance of this show. Absolutely wonderful!! I'm so thrilled with all the episodes.,10
"Good start, bad finish","The first 4 episodes were exciting and engaging for what they are, visually vibrant and engaging. The second half of the season is another story. So uninspired and just boring! The last episode, I skipped much of the dialogue. And the twist at the end? Girl, bye.",7
Loved it!,I don't get the bad reviews at all my fiancé and I absolutely loved Bridgerton and cannot wait for the 2nd series. Imagining being back in the 1800s hasn't ever looked so good!!,10
I knew it lol,I knew as soon as I came to the user reviews it was gonna be a lot of hate. We all know the reason why not going to go into that but it's all fantasy FFS.,7
Adaptation is not exactly like the book,"I loved it. I've read the whole series and i can understand why they made more plots: one book doesn't have material to 8 episodes.
And its ok!
I loved everything, the costumes, the music, the chemistry between the Duke and Daphne!
Loved the relationship between Eloise and Benedict (which was another surprise! Lovely actor!)
Loved the Featherington plot line, and the Marina thing, cause I didn't feel a attachment for her in the books, and now i can!
Love the Queen and Lady Danburry specially her been Simon's tutor.About Anthony... he is lost, and the whole Siena thing makes so much better for the start of the plot for the next season, and how he loving Kate will be unexpected!For me, it was perfect!",10
Pride without Prejudice,"Goodness me, this is the most startling recreation of Regency England since Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy found zombies on their lawns a few years ago. Bodices are more spectacularly ripped than we usually see in Jane Austen adaptations, although the fundamental challenge of finding a rich titled husband for your cosseted (and corseted) daughters is still at the heart of the story. This is a Georgian DOWNTON ABBEY, quite a bit raunchier and quite a lot more downmarket.What sets BRIDGERTON apart is its ""colour-blind"" casting. Simon, Lord Hastings, our dashing hero (and boy, is he dashing!) is played by a black actor (Regé-Jean Page), as are many of Queen Charlotte's queen's courtiers and even the Queen herself (Golda Rosheuval). It takes a bit of getting used to - I kept thinking (very unPC, unBLM) that we were in Louisiana and (oh, happy thought) the slaves had taken over the plantation. But the casting is the key ingredient that gives BRIDGERTON its big dollop of freshness. Phoebe Dynevor's Daphne Bridgerton, whose on-off relationship with Lord Hastings is at the core of the drama, gives a feisty modernist performance, but she rather pales (if I may use that word) in comparison with some of the other debutantes.The Simon-Daphne romance gets too much screen-time, as does Miss Thompson's unmarried pregnancy and the mystery identity of gossip-monger Lady Whistledown (voiced by Julie Andrews who, alas, does not appear onscreen). BRIDGERTON plays out as a period soap, which is what Jane Austen's intricate social comedies tend to be reduced to for viewing audiences. Mad King George is barely glimpsed, and the Prince Regent not at all. The one gay couple at court seem to have fallen foul of censorship or more likely the cutting-room shears; let's hope this is redressed in Series Two.Series Two? A decade from now we'll be in Series Ten. This is pure tosh, lavishly costumed and backgrounded, and it will run and run.",7
Disappointing,"It's supposed to be based on the book. It's so loosely based that it's a *completely* different story. They didn't even get the big scenes from the book right. I lost it once he proposed to Edwina which never would have happened with the characters from the book.In addition, Kate is a terrible actress and her accent slips quite a bit. While I can appreciate an Easter Egg here and there, way too much of this show was about the other characters; this was supposed to be about Kate and Anthony.I loved this book, it's my favorite in the series. This season is entirely disappointing and I can't believe they got it so wrong.",2
The racism in the comments is disgusting,"Is it historically accurate? No, is it ok to change history to suit THIS TIME, absolutely.
I don't get the absolute ignorance in all the comments. Color of the skin doesn't matter, the costumes and sceneries are beautiful, the dialogues funny, the story engaging. That's it.",10
"Binge worthy series, impatiently awaiting season 2!",Season 2 can't come soon enough for me. And love Julie Andrews as the narrator!!,9
Why the low ratings??,This unique series from Netflix is absolutely brilliant so how is it only 7.4 in the ratings? It doesn't fit with the show being number 1 globally and in the top 10 in other places?This first season is excellent and now looking forward to the second! Can't wait to see how the characters develop!The soundtrack alone is amazing and perfectly chosen for certain scenes allowing for perfect emotion! The actors are so so good and the storylines have you consumed. Costumes are gorgeous and delicate!Only good things to say for this epic show!!,
Please don't compare to Pride and Prejudice,I'm okay with watching this film just for the fun but Jane Austen is an artist and her usage of words and ability illustrate people and their world they live in is comparable to a skilled painter and his brush strokes.,6
Wonderful!,So refreshing to see the heart of a story embraced!,10
The Multiverse meets Austen,"As a fan of the British costume drama, I must admit I approached the series with some trepidation.The central conceit is that Bridgerton exists in an alternative history English regency period where race is no longer a barrier to rank ,marriage and social advancement .One's position in society completely determined your role and in what caste you were able to marry and this particular genre generally relies on the strict boundaries of a stratified society to create the dramatic tension .In a period classic like Pride and Prejudice the division of rank between the Bennetts and Darcey and Bingley fuels this tension and is one of the main barriers the lead protagonists must overcome .The idea that Darcey would marry so below his rank was untenable. The idea that he would marry someone who wasn't European is not in the realms of possibility.So when the creators of Bridgerton removed the race barrier from this imaginary world they removed much of the social constraint that makes these period pieces so compelling . One has to wonder why as an aside why the Queen didn't wave her wand and remove sexism and class prejudice as well but hey it's their fantasy. One character who's entire purpose was to incessantly voice the lack of female empowerment seems rather hollow in the pampered environment of Mayfair and when its intercut with the Queen who appears to have complete control of the kingdom with a mad king.This lessening of dramatic tension proved a difficulty for me in the central story of Season one . With rank and race no longer a tangible barrier, the obstacles to Simon and Daphne's happiness started to feel contrived and eventually you just wished that they would get over themselves.Happily for me in season 2 the show was much more successful in portraying the dramatic tensions of the lead protagonists courtship. The barriers of duty and sisterly obligation were believable and I thought the show was artful in its presentation of the slow burn and unbearable frisson between the leads. Like all good romantic leads they start off hating each other but the gradual transformation was artful and believable due to the two leads palpable chemistry.In drama its critical because of its obvious contrivance that the viewer has to suspend their disbelief . Unlike in Season one, Season 2 one could put that aside and just enjoy the ride.",7
Loved the 1st season,I truly loved watching the first season and cannot wait for more. I was stunned when I watched the extra drama that was enter into the story but it didn't make me not want to watch the series or dampen my anticipation to watch the next season for Anthony's story. I am definitely looking forward to watching Benedict's and Colin's story most of all,10
Not the same,"The first season was very true to the novel. Season two has the same characters but the storyline is completely different! Some of that is good, some very disappointing.",6
Truly Lovable series...,"Not 100 percent true to quinns novels but books to screen never are, something I prepared myself before watching.A wonderful series even if hadnt read the books before would have still enjoyed. Love the twist with morden music in classic form, the sets and costumes are exquisite.
The cast are amazing and well casted.As for those saying its not historically correct, its not meant to be, hate to tell you this but this isn't real!!! This isn't based on real life, it isn't a true story, and never once claimed to be.
Dont let your racism show and enjoy the show and the actors for their amazing work and not judge the colour of someones skin ( your only embarrassing yourself)Only Wish the characters especially the bridgerton family members were more like their orginal novel selves. There is a reason Quinn fans love the bridgerton family so much writers please don't change that.Can not wait for series 2!!!",10
I like it,"Depsite what other people think of the show I actually do enjoy it and I'm not the biggest fan of old-timey shows. I know it might not be 100% accurate but I don't mind. I love the costumes and the music, the visuals are pleasing too. I like the story and find that it's paced well, the actors are good at bringing the characters alive.",6
Can't get enough,"Hello Netflix, um please hurry up with the next season. This is a fabulous show. Makes me want to move to England and get my own Duke. It's Riveting, draws you into the story and you just can't get enough.",10
stunning,"An absolutely wonderful show. brilliant cast, gorgeous visuals, amazing soundtrack! very compelling",10
Jane Austen meets Melrose Place,Stop trying to make Bridgerton happen. So cringeworthy and so technically amiss. You treat your viewing public like imbeciles when you attempt to make history relatable. Stick with facts and history....why do you think Downton Abbey was such a hit? The delight is in the details.,
Season 2 is so much better,They nailed the chemistry and the slow burn. I enjoyed season 2 so much more. Great performances from Simone and Jonathan. I didn't read the book so the changes didn't bother me.,7
Absolutely in love!!,I absolutely love this show! I felt like it was a 19th century Gossip Girl with drama fit for that era. The casting was amazing and I loved the integration of POC characters. Seeing that representation on the screen especially in a period piece that normally wouldn't have that was beautiful. I found it extremely entertaining! Must watch!!This series is meant to be a fun period piece not historically accurate. So if you're looking for something along those lines then this show is not for you.I really hope there's a season 2,9
Historical mistake,"In season 2 at the wedding reception of Lord Bridgerton & Lady Edwina, ice sculptures were seen. As the show is set in the 18th century ( 1700s), they seemed out of place. A quick Google search said that ice sculptures weren't invented until the late 19th century in France. This was a glaring mistake.",7
Thoroughly enjoyable and a wonderful escape,"First off, the inaccuracy in this show doesn't come from black aristocrats as so many people have been complaining about. Clearly, these people are uneducated idiots with no comprehension of English History, particularly in the late 18th and early 19th century, who have also never watched the film 'Belle', based off the TRUE story of Dido Elizabeth Belle, a mixed-race British heiress, born into slavery, taken back to England by her father and raised by an Earl. So the idea of black aristocrats is not so ridiculous as these ignorant, foolish ""critics"" complain about it being. (Not all black people were slaves in England, maybe try looking at black communities that existed during Elizabeth I's reign who were ordinary people and not slaves to correct your clearly ill-informed assumptions - particularly the BBC's article entitled ""Britain's first black community in Elizabethan London"").
Now that that's cleared up, I will say that this is historical fiction/romance, and as always, allowances can be made for historical inaccuracy because the 'history' part is often less important in these sorts of stories than the romance, and I'm certainly not watching this for historical accuracy - if I wanted that, I'd watch something on the Smithsonian channel.
I don't normally go in for romance, but I have to say that even the rather outlandish plot, the hideous fashion that the Featheringtons favour, and the slightly over-dramatic nature of the entire thing hasn't put me off or dulled my enjoyment of this series. It is entertaining, and an escape from the dull, rather bleak reality we're all living through at the moment, and so in that way, it provides the perfect kind of escapism, something completely unlike real life, where true love wins, despite all of the troubles along the way, and the bad guys have their downfall (I'm thinking particularly of Daphne's first suitor/proposal. She throws a particularly good punch, so well done Daphne!). Gossip Girl set in a historical (though fairly inaccurate) setting, and thoroughly enjoyable",9
Well YES it is NOT set in real world but it has got some really good points!,"I think all of us who watched the two seasons thought that the director is a fool but okay it is not a historical drama! There are full of inaccuracies or to be honest it is all set in another imaginary world which reminds London during Regency Era in some points. But that is exactly the mistake of the direction,they should have inferred that it is ANOTHER world or maybe they should have named the city with another name.If we overcome these problems the stories are good and so is the acting! The 1st love story is a copy of pride and prejudice but in a more modern way so that the teens will like it while I guess they would find boring the original one! The 2nd story has an interesting characters' development which I really liked a lot!I think I will see season 3 too!",7
Entertaining and revolutionary!,I am thoroughly entertained and thrilled by this show's revolutionary vision!,10
Why the hate??,Was this amazing ??? No. Was it we had as what people plate reviewing def not. Think a mix of gossip girl and revenge and put it in the 1800 costumes. The fact that a creative choice in casting was made should not be met with so much anger and hate. This is not a historical piece and to give it more than they is obscene! It's soap in rather elaborate costume. Watch it to be entertained ... as the storyline is pretty weak and obvious but still enjoyable.,6
Season 2 is a huge disappointment,"Season 1 of Bridgerton was wonderful but season 2 is a huge disappointment. Season 1 followed the book but changed aspects to improve the overall story. The show does not follow the book AT ALL for season two. Instead it is just a slow, frustrating story lacking the romance we all desired. Book two is my favorite from the Bridgerton series but the second season felt like a chore to get through. I feel like the Kate from the books didn't even make it into the show. Hopefully they can redeem themselves, although I have lost all excitement for seasons to come.",3
Bridgerton X Bridgerton,"If you read the books, and want everything the same, i'm sorry but even the best movies can be like the books of they are based for.
So, with that in mind you need to watch this series, really, it's a piece of an art from Shonda and Chris, it's complety difference of everything we saw until now about them. And they were so faithful with our fellings about the this incredible family and characters, since Simon is describe like a different man, so i think the actor was awesome, the actress who plays Daph is marvelous! Both are! All the crew are. And since i'm historian i can assure you guys, the black people was , and is of course, but at the time was a very important part of society, since Queen Charlotte is describe as an almost black woman! Then, i think that's not a problem, and the actors are amazing, the serie is amazing, is almost like as the book, but we can meet better the characters of the next books, witch is good for a show, let's be open mind guys! Let's enjoy this beautiful series! Let's support the show and everyone, Julia Quinn too, she is so happy, so i really believe they maked a incredible show, and i hope we have more seasons!",10
Loved IT!!,I have not read the books and not normally one who loves period drama (but with a family who all do) I found this one of the best period dramas around. LOVED all those casted!!!,10
When will asian actors get a chance in supposedly colourblind casting?,I have no problem with colourblind casting in this kind of production but it annoys me that in the UK there is twice the population of south asians as there is of black citizens and yet this is never represented to the world.Black talent ALWAYS pushes out asian talent in colourblind casting for international audiences and this is a deliberate manipulation.And why is there not even one single east asian actor in the extended cast?? Shameful.,
Well cooked Romance Novel,"The Romance novel is a guilty pleasure. Reading one is like eating a bag of potato chips with a pint of ice cream. You should have a better book but nah....So goes it with this series. The costumes, settings, and people are beautiful. The plot is cobbled together from Austin and Shakespeare and Days of Our Lives. The characters are the same plucky heroine and cranky duke types that attend every bodice ripper. Acting is mediocre. The peasants in this show appear to have figured out baths two hundred years before indoor plumbing. The dirt roads are perfectly graded. The streets are free of horse frisbees.I have to admit I binged the whole show. As much as I complain about this kind of presentation it does take me away from current events. I need to step out of the real world into this fantasy. I looked it up. There are nine novels in this series. Not sure I ant to hang out with these Bridgertons for that long",6
A master piece,"This show is so far the best adaptation from this gender, I can see how some people is going to be unhappy over all the changes but In my point of view all changes came from help it!
I love how they gave us something we was asking but also some details we did not know we wanted, as any adaptation.
I'm also deeply happy that they kept all the important moments but changed the lines.
Regé is PERFECT for Simon role, Phobe was able to make Daph even better then the original character.
Even this small detail about Anthony falling in love and having a broken heart over his affair with Siena, which we do not see in the books at all, was a good thing from the place I stand.
It's a DRAMA show and that's precisely what Shondaland gave us. I can't wait for more.",9
"Not the greatest show, BUT not as bad as most people trying with force to prove","Actually i hated it when i turned it first on. I didn't want to watch it, because i was expecting poetic jane austen, historical period drama, and not an americanised politically or whatsover correct u call it now days, show. Yes i am reffering to the fact that there is a very diverse cast in a english 19th century setting. BUT YES, THERE IS A BUT, i gave it a chance. And surprisingly it's entertainig. You just need to accept it, as it is, a fantasy story for adults, more or less a pretty naive gossip girl version. So if you're not a historian, but a teenager or a housewife in your 40s and up, who enjoyed the grey shades, you will enjoy this easy story, with a lot of unneccessary sex scenes (starting episode 5), nice costumes and nice filming locations. So enjoy, or don't.",6
Loved it!,"Fabulous acting and a very compelling love story.
Can't wait for season 2!",9
"An enjoyable storyline, far from flawless","I want to give this a higher rating, I really do. I love period pieces, and it was nice to see POCs not treated as subhuman. I don't care that it's not 100% historically accurate, I'm watching it for the love story, not a history lesson.One of the major problems I have is how many sex scenes they were. There were normally at least one per episode and it wasn't necessary. I want to watch a drama, not porn.Is it the absolute best drama in the world? No. Is it enjoyable? Yes.",6
Delicious escapism,"As a huge fan of the books, I had low expectations but this series is great! The costumes, the Regency day to day life. I love the characters and the diversity. They aren't trying to wash away history, it's a dream reality of escapism. Stop making this Roots or Color Purple. It's a period high production romance and it's amazing and enjoyable, witty and emotional and entertaining. Eloise is my favorite and I'm interested in seeing her character explored.",10
Old fashioned soap opera,"Episode 6 season two, Edwina slams
The door on her wedding gown train , that scene should have been redone ! Also this series is nothing more than a soap a opera set in the 1800's. Sometimes a yawn fest .",6
This is Ridiculous,"This show has great production values but that's about it. It looks great. The plot is a joke. The casting is a joke and totally unrealistic for the time period. Tons of minorities to be Politically Correct but sorry, that's not the way it was in 1813 England. Lol.
The characters are totally uninteresting. I usually enjoy British stuff but this is super weak. I can't believe this many people watched this show. This show honestly encapsulates the dumbing down of society.",2
An Excellent Period Piece,Simply wonderful. Well acted and delightful in its visual design.,10
"Don't believe the poor reviews, this show is fantastic!","Beautiful costumes, setting and story. No, I haven't read the book. The review is about the show. If you enjoy time period pieces with a twist and romance, you'll love this show. Just watch it!!",9
I loved every minute,"I loved every minute of this. I've never read the books, I had no expectations whatsoever, and I couldn't care less if it isn't historically correct. It's Jane Austen meets Gossip Girl. It's romance, drama, and schemes. If you want a documentary, go watch something else. This is great entertainment, just as it was supposed to be. Merry Christmas!",
If nothing else to watch ...,Found silly but quite erotic .Some good acting from some of the characters should be mentioned .,6
"A great watch, inspired by a great book series.","I have to admit that there are differences from the book series, but I am ok with that. As any one how has watched a movie or series based off a book knows it is never the same. That being said I enjoy most of the changes that they have made. I think that they add to the story. I am looking forward to see what happens with the rest of the series.",8
50 Shades of Downton Abbey,"That's it, nuff said. But apparently I need to write more to publish. So I will say again...this is, quite literally, 50 shades in a different era with even more drama. I finished the first season but really don't care what happens to any of the charters. Well, I lied. Eloise. That chick is hilarious.",6
"I don't normally write reviews, just trivia, but","This time I must make an exception. I haven't read the books and only watched to spend a little quality time with my wife. Many reviews talk about historical accuracy and lousy this or that. First let me add to the complaint.
The story takes place in 1816. Many of the hairstyles and clothing styles came into being in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. People are smoking taylor-made cigarettes. The first (very unreliable) machine was made in the 1850's. A reliable machine was invented in the 1880's. Don't even get me started on the cigarettes having filters. It must be noted very few complained when Denzel Washington was Don Pedro in ""Much Ado About Nothing"" or a ""Hamlet"" that appeared to be during WW1. Let me also mention Benedict Cumberbatch's ""Sherlock"".
Now, this is Shondaland's interpretation of classic literature, nothing more. The acting is very capable, the sets and costumes are quite eye-catching. I'm a bit of a purist and prefer my classics left in their ""natural habitat"" but my wife and I quite enjoyed this. I also liked ""Sherlock"". Kick back with a cocktail and enjoy.",8
"Entertainment, not history, and perfectly watchable.","This is a Pride and Prejudice style romp around regency London in the style of Gossip Girl or The OC, with a hint of Wes Anderson and a smattering of Baz Luhrman.Perfectly watchable and entertaining, fairly fast paced, colourful, and fun. It is not high art or history, but not is it meant to be. Things like the colour-blind casting, to me, added to the energy, and - hell - why not!If you want an accurate costume drama this is possibly not for you, but give it a whirl. If you want a bit of fancy-dress fun and intrigue, have a crack.",7
Perfect show,"This show is the absolute definition of a perfect show in my opinion, it has everything you need and are looking for in a tv show, it has the drama, the romance, the tension, the anger, the humour, and much more, i believe as well that any person of any age would enjoy this show as much as i have.
Yours sincerely,
Lady whistledown.",10
I really enjoyed it! Binged the first season in two days!,"I haven't read the books that the show is based off of, but I really enjoyed this series. If you are glued to the screen when drama and love is underway you will enjoy it. I believe it was a good choice to have this show set in the 1800s. I know other reviewers are saying it didn't add anything, but I felt like I was in another world while watching. I believe the innocence of the characters (especially the females) wouldn't of worked in this day of age. The chemistry between the two main love interests, Daphne and Simon, is wonderful and shows no restraints. Beware of the frequent sex scenes!! The situations of integrity and titles really fit with the time as well. The pain, passion, and tension between the characters was portrayed beautifully and added a lot of depth and emotion to the scenes. I also enjoyed the modern songs turned classical, it added a nice touch, along with the integration of color among the actors. Obviously this wouldn't of been common in that time, but I believe they all fit the role perfectly and I couldn't imagine other actors playing the parts.",7
Entertaining,I loved the campiness and the tongue in cheek soundtrack. I also liked the Gossip Girl twist.,9
Held my attention a lot longer than others like it !,"Wow. I'm not one to normally write reviews however this series really caught me off guard! Despite the elegant wardrobe and setting, this is far from your normal period drama. I might be in a minority, however your regular p&p and little women haven't held my attention half as much as this has! Reading other reviews, I don't mind the 'inaccuracies' as frankly this series brought someone new to the genre and was a whole lot more entertaining because of it! So to those who relate, give this a watch- maybe you will surprise yourself.",8
Delighted!,"The production and wardrobe steals the show, while the actors shine in their own way. Yes, it plays like a romance book, corny, over the top at times, but quite enjoyable.",
"Nothing about this show is historical, it's just entertaining fantasy","I thought it was entertaining and not terrible but nothing special.
It would be nice if people realised that just about nothing in this show is historically accurate (not the costumes, not the hair, not the jewellery, not the music, not the dancing, not the way people speak to each other etc. etc....maybe just the houses they live in), so to say you have a problem with the diverse cast because it's not historically accurate is just plain stupid.
I personally found the chaotic and unruly mixing of completely modern and historically inspired styles to be annoying and distracting but the diversity of the cast members had nothing to do with that, and I thought the actors were all doing a pretty good job.
Anyway, if you're looking for a (somewhat) accurate historical drama just go watch something else, there's plenty of good stuff out there.",6
For a romantic show this goes at the top of my list,"Great acting, beautiful storyline
Dephne is so innocent yet so powerful and the dreamy duke who was just perfect, honestly their chemistry is why i think this show is great
but my fav is Eloise, Claudia make this character so lovable",10
Kind of meh,"I have only watched 3 episodes so far and so maybe it isnt fair to judge until I have seen the whole season. But so far Im kind of meh on the show. I do really like the characters of Penelope and Eloise but I just find the leads kind of boring. And the drama of the show feels like something out of a teen girl fanfic.I dont know, its not the worst show in the world. I could probably finish off the season just fine. But at the same time it just hasnt really captivated me. If you're looking for a period piece show that has modern flair to it, The Great is a helluva lot better.",6
An easy watch,"Personally i really liked this show. Loads of people saying it's not historically accurate and they're just trying to be PC etc, but who watches period dramas for a history lesson?! Queen Charlotte was actually the first black Queen in the 1700's, Wife of King George III. I just thought it was an easy watch and a good drama, which is what it is, i didn't watch it expecting to learn history.",9
Netflix biggest hit ever as reported by them.,"This show is suppose to defy tradition, and demonstrates that period drama are not limited in scope or audience. This show isn't meant to be real history, but more lavish, sexier, and funnier than the standard period drama.So if you can break away from what we know about real time during this time and open minded, that you might find the show good",7
No one ever said this was historically accurate. Just enjoy it.,"What if race never mattered, or in context of the show celebrated cultural diversity. This is essentially what Bridgerton is. It is not wiping or rewriting history, instead using our observations of modern society and transplanting into another era. Just watch this for the snappy dialogue, great characters and classical interpretation of modern music.",8
Though not history - a historical fact remains,"Central parts of this filmed fantasy aren't far from old fact. Back in the day King George III of England married Sophia Charlotte von Mecklenburg-Streleitz; a mulatto of the Portuguese aristocratic bloodline (who in fact actually looks like one of the female characters). They had 13 brown babies which ran all through the prominent houses of that century.The scenes are slick, the intrigue compelling - the minds of man are no-doubt the same now as always. Game, as it is played on an upper-class level of privilege and prestige. A good watch.",7
Just what I needed to cheer me up.,Pure escapism. I've read the books so was looking forward to this. Virtually stunning.,9
Good show,"Unlike all these other reviewers who hide behind some other reason to hate on this show, I found it refreshing. This show has a lot more substance than the other typically woke dramas that are out there.",8
"I appreciate what they're going for, but... HORK","Painful and cringe-worthy. There's not much to say about this, it's just a swing and a miss. The Great did an awesome job of seamlessly integrating a diverse cast in a story which would traditionally be super white. This attempt was clunky, and that's not the worst of it... the writing is iffy and the romantic elements are downright uncomfortable. I could go on, but this review isn't worth your time any more than the show is. Hard pass.",
Entertaining enough,It was entertaining. If you're looking for an epic historically accurate piece then this isn't it and it doesn't pretend to be. It's just a modern love story with a Victorian era backdrop. It succeeds at being that. I think the leads did well and had solid chemistry although surprisingly the best couple to me was Anthony and Sienna. I enjoyed their scenes most of all. Everything between them was so intense. Their passion overshadowed the leads a bit for me. Those actors really delivered,7
"If you prefer ""accuracy"" over ""diversity"" and ""wokeness"", this show isn't for you","I loved it! It's a beautiful romantic historical fiction featuring a lot of scandalous behavior, secrets, lies, and, of course, good old fashioned romance.Simon (Regé-Jean Page) and Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor) have a chemistry that I had yet to see on the big or small screen - one that mirrors real life romances. The dislike on both accounts is obvious, watching it grow to love was beautiful and stunning.Bridgerton isn't about the accurate retelling of history... it's just a show that has taken freely a specific era of history. Period dramas have often, and rightfully, been criticized for lacking in the diversity of its cast and Bridgerton is evidence that a racially diverse cast can not only work but add to the beauty and appeal of a costume drama. Another important contemporary touch is all of the soft sex scenes, female pleasure focused sex scenes actually. Interwoven with its contemporary sensibilities and sneaky feminism is a comfort with portraying female pleasure that is widely missing from pop culture.So... if you prefer ""accuracy"" over ""diversity"" and ""wokeness"", this show isn't for you.Spoiler:
I would have give it a 10, but the 6th episode where Daphne assaulted her husband made me really uncomfortable...",9
Easy nice watch,Average easy going nice watch. Some of the characters were unnecessary and some were great.,7
Enchanted by a historical fantasy,"The actors, the dialogue, the architecture, the art, the colors, the costumes. Everything transfers you to another beautiful world. You almost feel enchanted. It's just so beautiful.
100% a must watch!",10
Not Downton Abby,"Enjoyed the usual. Jewelry, dresses etc. story was good, lots of adult content.",6
A great distraction as it's meant to be.,"Good grief the reviews nagging on this about the historical accuracy - it's a guilty pleasure, people. It's meant to be funny, sexy and *gasp* entertainment.The show is engaging with a wide variety of humans playing different kinds of human strifes, struggles and challenges. So throw your history books away and live a life of wild abandon by giving into the dark side.",10
Delightfully entertaining!,"Ok- so season 1 was a solid 10 for me. When I heard Page was not returning (true to the books) I didn't think I'd tune in to season 2. While Season 1 had PLENTY let's say seduction and passionate scenes, season 2 toned it down somewhat. That was ok. I was instantly smitten with the Viscount and Kates relationship. I flew through episodes 1-7 with 7 climaxing (see what I did there!) However, the final episode 8 disappointed a little. You cannot beat the wit, costumes, and modern day music played by the orchestra. My fave is Eloise, the Queen, and Lady Danbury!",7
I feel book lovers may be disappointed,"I loved the first series, and then read the books. Unfortunately, I think this has tainted my view of this series, I keep making comparisons and I don't think I like some of the changes made from the book. Especially to the Edwina character. She falls for someone at The Aubrey Hall party in the books and never falls for Anthony and they never get engaged. They also really pale down Kates fear of storms. It's one of the turning points in the book in their love story when he sees her in the library.The whole back story of Kate being a nobody and not being a Sheffield is completely wrong, it makes a mockery of the marriage if she isn't of aristocratic blood. And takes the plot of Benedict's story next series nearly.I don't think they needed to change the story as much as they did to make ""drama"". I understand some changes from book to tv, but this is almost just names that are kept the same. And in fact they changed those.If you're not a book reader, you'll probably love it. I love the aesthetic of the show. And it is good escapism.",5
It's fun,"With everything going on at the moment, I really enjoyed this fun show. It doesn't take itself too seriously and I LOVE the diversity in the casting. If you like rom coms and just want something relaxing and easy to watch then this is good.",9
Read the books. Love the series.,"I've read these books multiple times. They are adult fairy tales. No one lived like this ever. Elements of it are true. Reputation not facts were everything. The series and the books are bodice rippers with happily ever afters. The series is a break from our chaotic world where inflation makes you stay home more. The men usually come to their senses and say the right thing. The women are beautiful, and the clothes are fabulous. They took some liberties--so what? It's so much more entertaining than the lies the press pedals. As a school teacher, I need a break from deadlines, abuse of children, and my insignificant paycheck. I can sit in my crappy t-shirt and watch pretty people work through drama and end up happy. Good times for real. Lady Danbury is my favorite. The actress does an excellent job portraying her.",8
Absolutely FANTASTIC!,"Brilliantly made series from the amazing Netflix. I can't believe the bad reviews? I think there is some kind of jealousy going on! Or people are too narrow minded to understand!! Lavish sets, great detailing, BEAUTIFUL costumes and FANTASTIC cast and acting from ALL! LOVE the use of modern music played with violin, so creative!Hurry up season 2! and move on virus so we see it quicker",
Suspend your disbelief and its really a soap opera...,"Difficult to know where to start with this one. Clearly historical accuracy was not one of the goals in terms of the varied ethnicities of the cast but the production team had no intention of producing a factual replica of regancy England. Dallas and Dynasty in the 1980s featured mostly Anglo-Saxon casts as did many soaps. Doctor Who and James Bond were always older white males until recently. Either productions strives for accuracy or they can modernises the soap opera format using the best actors for the part. It seems that some people are finding it uncomfortable to watch but that is there problem not the production teams.To the series then... Clearly some liberties have been taken with the source material but it is difficult to tell the same story as a book especially when set in this period. The dresses and suits worn by the cast are wonderfully colourful and the sets are fantastic. It is a fantasy soap opera so there's an element of camp but it helps move the story on. The pace is good, only slowing down for back stories when the narration keeps the viewer interested. The speech is modernised but it doesn't detract from the plot. The 'who done it' element keeps you guessing with several red herrings, not worthy of Agetha Christie but I kept watching nevertheless.To summerise, suspend your disbelief for 8 hours and it will be a lot of fun. Judge it by the standards of BBCs Pride and Predujice (Colin & Jennifer) and it doesn't quite get there but no period drama quite beats P&P, does it?",6
Relax...bubblegum for the mind,"Too many haters taking this so seriously. My husband and I binged all 8 episodes in two days. Fanciful, beautiful scenery, costumes, absurd lines...I mean if you're looking to lose yourself for awhile in a simple, fantasy, alternative reality...why not? I didn't want a history piece. It made me smile, laugh, and yes...it has many True Romance Novel-style love scenes. But hey, I enjoyed it like I did those cheap novels by the pool during summer when I was young. Don't take it seriously and you should enjoy yourself. (No, I didn't read the books)",8
Not bad; differs from the book,"I am a big fan of this book series so was very much looking forward to this adaptation. As a series by itself, it is not bad. It does, however, differ greatly from the book series. So if your expecting a true adaptation, this is not it. The essentials are there as the ground work, but there is much that is added and changed. Which doesn't mean it's bad, just different. I enjoyed the series and am curious to see how the next season goes, especially to see how Penelope looks in the next season. Those of us who read the series were not surprised by the reveal at the end.",7
Better than season 1!!,"Absolutely loved season 2 even more than season 1 which I must add I enjoyed also. Season 2 was about forbidden love, longing looks, desire and passion without needing sex to show this and I commend them for it because many times I had to pause whilst watching because it had me on the edge of my seat. I thought the main actors Jonathan Bailey and Simone Ashley did an amazing job at conveying the emotions of two people struggling to choose between duty and love. Also, Charithra Chandran playing Edwina was far better and more complex a character than was written in the book. I must add in particular Charithra acting in episode 6 was fantastic! I can't see how no one could enjoy it... I will be rewatching again until next season is out. I think people will have to understand it's a series of 8 books with 8 different characters falling in love and it will show different facets of love they can't all be the same as season 1 or 2. Better to go in with open mind.",9
A fantasy romance. No more and but certainly no less.,"For those enjoy costume drama, this series won't disappoint but neither will it, I suspect, be long remembered. The writing lacks the confidence and humour of British shows in this genre. While the costumes and sets are as beautiful and sumptuous as we've come to expect, some of the other production decisions, like the CGI cityscapes and one particular horse riding sequence, are jarringly unconvincing. The acting is fine, only sometimes hampered by clunky dialogue which flips wildly between stylised Regency and modern English.It's entertaining escapist fluff and passes the time pleasantly enough, but I'm fairly sure I will have forgotten all about it by next week.",7
More please!,So good! I loved every minute of it. I hope there is a second season!,10
Jane Austen it ain't! (tiny spoiler),"What a lot of camp nonsense, and I loved it!The historical accuracy leaves a little to be desired. If people of colour had the respect and social position back then that is portrayed, the world would certainly be a better place now than it is. At first, I thought this was just colour blind casting, but the issue of race is, very briefly, addressed in the dialogue.Fabulous costumes, acting, production values in general.Looking forward to where they go with a second season. As Daphne and Simon's 'Disney prince and princess, but with shagging', story has been told, I'm assuming they'll be looking at the other characters in more detail. There's plenty of scope.I guessed who Lady Whistledown is ;)",7
So bad it's funny,"Basically, this is a teen soap set up as period drama.Terrible acting, awful characters, and cringeworthy dialogue. I spent most of the time laughing or sighing.",1
I loved it,It was exciting and interestning and much love in it. And obviously based on a book,9
Brilliant!!!!,"I love it!!, and how the roles of expectations in society are reversed. Very good and worth watching",10
Expected more,"No historical accuracy, no chemistry no quality acting.. I am really sad, i read the book, i was waiting for something spectacular. Don't misunderstand, it is not terrible, just not good. And disappointing.",
This rating is strictly for season 2,"I loved the first season, was great, a little lacking for family characters but that was made up in season 2. However s2 leaves you a little disappointed, no where near as much steaminess as s1 and although I liked that story line and how we got to see more about the family as whole, we never got to see the Duke just the Duchess. And it felt a little drawn out how long we ahd to wait for the conclusion we all knew was come.Still a good show and still enjoyed watching it very much, but s1 was way better, sorry.",7
IT IS WHAT IT IS a romance of epic proportions - awsome,"Oh dear so many awful reviews. I wondered if i had moved into the twighlight zone.This is set in Regency times. King George III who now historians believe may have been suffering with Porphria. A bored queen Charlotte who filled her sad days with games manipulating her royal subjects. It wasnt until part way in I realised she was being played by a black actress. I thought she was amazing actually her face said it all. She obviously loved her husband but had no idea how to deal with his madness and everytime she could she should visit him in more lucid moments. It must have been quite hard for her to deal with.Then she meets the beautiful and flawless Daphne Bridgerton. It was then I was slowly introduced to the family. Daphne an innocent who was meeting the Queen on her coming out. With comments of the queen one would expect Daphne to have a queue of suitors, well she did sort of but sadly her over proective brother ruined that for her.The story is slow unfolding we get to meet all the main characters, and their stories enrwine within the story. We get to meet the family the Bridgertons i loved the mother, and Eloise too, and the eldester brother who was lost as he just had no idea how to run a family and was besotted with an opera singer. Benedict Bridgerton bored of society who slipped quietly into the unknown world of gay, and orgies and arists. Colin a quiet young man kind.then we met The Duke and i fell in love lol. We learnt of his terrible childhood, so bad it turned him away from love and family. His fathers cruelty he was only saved by the lovely but fierce Lady Danbury who i fell in love with such a wonderful character..I just loved the series never read the books. Its truly and epic love story. Whats all this WOKE business? I never noticed the characters ethnicity. If people dont think there were a mix race going on in Regency times well they need to get their heads out of he sand. The morality in that time was pretty non existant. Anythinig went, and Shonda Rimes used the right mix of it for me.I have recommended this to many of my friends who have now binged it and all LOVED IT. we cant wait for Season 2.Its full of intrigue, incest, homosexuality, you name it well its in there.As to queen charlotte several historians have said Charlotte was directly descended from a Black branch of the Portuguese royal family: Alfonso III and his concubine, Ouruana, a Black Moor.WATCH ENJOY.",10
Pride and Prejudice meets Gossip Girl,"What Gossip Girl would have been in the 1800's mixed with Pride and Prejudice. Really intriguing, great storyline, and suspenseful. Ready for season two!",7
True to the book itself,If you enjoyed historical romance with a bit of scandal and swoons thrown in then this series is for you. The historical accuracy is nearly zero but the series was well told as it almost retold the novel. It was as captivating as the book and an easy watch,8
Harmless entertainment and fun to watch,"Built boldly and gaudily on imagination rather than historical accuracy, but for all that loads of fun for a winter binge watch. Gowns, bosoms, corsets, imaginative bumping of uglies in all kinds of contexts, maidens dishonoured and men deceived....it's an absolute hoot. The script writers seem to have played arcane word bingo, working obscure words into strange syntax like crazy. 'Should' as the main verb again and again.... 'I should retire to bed. Should you not join me?'....monthlies, with child and coming out litter the dialogue and one episode had the writers vying for the number of times they employed the phrase 'leading strings'. It is all imagination and fun but even so someone in continuity and scripting needs a talking-to about the missing diamond necklace. Watch it to spot it - I thought it was a plot twist but it wasn't. It also has two pure comedy vignettes of the 'close up of actor riding a pretend horse' type.",7
Its fun.,Its a cute entertaining mildly predictable romance. The reviews would be higher but netflix dared to cast a few black actors and internet commenters cant have that.Ignore the bad reviews. Its a solid B+ if you like romantic dramas.,10
Where are the Chinese?,"They discriminated the Chinese. In that era there were many Chinese dukes, but the series show none.For true diversity they should include every race. Maybe some American Indians should be also included.",2
Stop with the silly 1star reviews,"That was an enjoyable watch. Well acted, good storyline and undeniable chemistry between the Daphne and Simon. Bring on season 2!",9
BRIDGERTON COLORFULL,"I, as a black woman, am very happy for the role of Regé, for the performance and delivery to the character. Bridgerton is not perfect, there are things that could be resolved in another way but it was still amazing. Incredible characters. Thank you Shonda!",10
I dont understand ..,"How does this have a 7,3 rating but looking at the reviews 99% of people reviewing have given it 1 or 2 stars a scathing reviews ..something smells ..there is no way this series should have a rating that high based on peoples actual comments that it is dribble.",
Next Generation Historical Drama,"Only two episodes in, but highly recommend for its almost perfect blend of genres with a delicate touch of mystery, comedy, lust and scandal. Once I lowered my expectation of a deeply moving drama and relaxed into Shondaland's virtuoso ability to entertain, Bridgetown becomes most entertaining. Nowhere near a Marie Antionette, but could classify with Downton Abbey.",7
"Bored me at first, took my heart at the end","We started watching Bridgerton as a kind of concession to my wife, who is a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice (the movie, the novel, the series). I had no great expectations, but the trailer looked nice and i liked the main storyline of Daphne and Simon pretending to be in love to flee the social restraints of the regency era of marrying the daughters away in the ball season.The first look was a bit irritating, with less convincing CGI-London, candy colored look, frilly dressed girls and overly well-built men in a Jane Austen memorial story. Also the many colored actors were a bit irritating on the first look, especially for a rather historical piece.But my wife liked it, so i watched it along her while reading. I thought. Beginning with the punch in the face of creepy Nigel Berbrooke, i (while reading) noticed more and more wonderful plot twists, the brillant soundtrack with its string covers of famous songs, the vivid look, the great production design, and last but not least the captivating chemistry between Daphne and Simon.So with each episode, the reading got less, the watching got more, and slowly all the criticism from the beginning not only forgotten, but got fused into an extasy of pictures and sound forming a fairy-tale-pop-version of the regency era, in which skin color does not matter, while restrictions of nobility and etiquette still matter enough. But what mattered most, was the story of Daphne and Simon (not to forget the many detailed but still erotic sex scenes), his grave oath, the identity of the mysterious, well informed and sharp-tongued Lady Whistledown, all the confusions of unrequited or improper love, all heading towards the brillant finale with its well deserved happy ending(s). Needless to say that i wasn't reading any more, and tears were shed not only on her side of the sofa...Overall i have to say that i got hooked by this brillant, modern, colorful intoxicating well written series and it's ending felt like a good friend leaving. Also, it continued to have an effect, especially as i noticed the many poor reviews here blaming it for a lack of historical correctness. Well, as historical correctness quite sure was not the main objective of the series, rather than taking some artistic liberties to tell a compelling story, i suppose the criticism is a different way of saying they don't like the diverse cast. For my part i can say that, as written, i also found it irritating at the beginning, but i love that in the end i did not notice it anymore - and i found the thought wonderful, that this might one day be the case in the real world. Well, a long way to go, but this series, besides all the wonderful moments it gave to me, also made some steps in that direction. Thank you.",9
Eloise Bridgerton 100% Fan,"Well, personally I wanted to see more of Eloise character, loved her attitude and development!
The rest where mostly like a Cinderella movie.
A love story with a predictable happy ending.
Beautifully designed costumes,amazing music nice 1800 atmosphere and well arranged diversity.
Entertaining show!",7
I don't get the hate for this show,"This is not aimed at middle aged men with no open mind. This may not be an exact replica of the books, but it is a great watch, with beautiful costume design, solid acting from accomplished experienced actors and new actors coming into the spotlight.
People need to lighten up. I personally found it a very easy watch and it has obviously appealed to many, hence the higher overall score out of 10. I have not spoken to anyone who has not enjoyed it. It is great to see Netflix again explore diversity in its casting yet again. It is a shame that the word 'woke' is banded about so freely, but it just means that the people using it are not open to change.
Some of the previous reviewers seem utterly stuck in their thinking that because this is a period drama, there should be no diversity. Books and stories can be open for interpretation, can be adapted, can include a multitude of different actors, new, experienced, different ethnicities, different shapes, sizes and ages. Open your minds people.
On that note if you are looking for something visually beautiful, easy to watch with solid acting then give it a try.",9
Both a SATIRE and a PARODY,"Critics got WAY too worked up over this series. First of all, consider the source:
it's NETFLIX, not Masterpiece Theater. It is a romp, not a tutorial. Enjoy it for what it is: a harmless filler for Covid boredom. Note the color coordination of the housing facades, the livery and the gowns of the competing families....the exaggerated wigs of the debutantes....at one point even the most AMAZING Afro! It caricatured period drama, Jane Austin, the Regency's fashions and mores....and accomplished that with a most beautiful and ""raceless"" cast. How refreshing!!!",7
Love it!!!!,"Beautiful costumes, interesting plot. It's not on history channel guys this is a Show for entertainment. What's with all the hate?? I loved it and can't wait for another season! The whole show was very beautiful and satisfying to watch. Give it a chance , sit back and relax!",10
The show was nice. Negative reviews are just racists in disguise,"I cannot believe the negative reviews here. Hiding behind the ""I do not like it because it is not historically accurate"". You are just racist. Like who cares?! What difference does it make if the characters are other than white. None of us lived in the 1800 so who cares. We have had enough of historically accurate movies. Sometimes things are made to be entertaining. I love to see all people living together in harmony. This show was nice. Not the very best but it was okay.",6
S2 - Love Triangles don't always work,"Anyone who has read the Bridgerton series will tell you that the Viscount Who Loved Me is a fan favourite. It is full of funny moments, iconic kisses under a desk, a bee sting, and an unforgettable Pall Mall game.While one does expect changes to the story for TV adaption, one hopes that these elements of a really great story would be kept intact.Let's start with the good things.Jonathan Bailey and Simone Ashley absolutely personify smouldering Anthony and fiery Kate.The rest of the cast is equally brilliant.The music is better than S1.The choreography is brilliant.The cinematography is sweeping and majestic.The locations are swoon worthy.That's it. That's the extent of what is good about S2.The fun romcom that I sat down to watch was nothing at all like I had expected. Since S1, I had expected that there would be plot changes, and additional plot lines and characters.The first two episodes trudge along nicely. Ep3 comes on, and its probably the best episode in the whole season. Then come episodes 4/5/6. I had to force myself to watch these episodes. One word. BORING!! Ep8 sort of redeems itself.By making one crucial change, (adding a dumb love triangle) they completely destroyed the Edwina we were expecting to see. The fun part of the book is when Edwina tries to matchmake Kate and Anthony. In the show, she transmutes to a screaming, emotional wreck, who's completely blind to her sister's feelings.From a romcom the series becomes a maudlin, melodramatic soap opera, worthy of any 90s Bollywood screenwriters. The tropes are so overdone, its a wonder I actually finished watching it.Then you have the clueless cultural appropriation. (This was offensive on a personal level)
a) Kate speaks in Hindi when she first meets Anthony
b) She calls her sister Bon (mispronounced, a word used in Bengali for sister)
c) Claims her sister speaks Hindi and Marathi (but not Bengali?!)
d) Calls mum and dad, appa and amma - when in Marathi should Tai and Baba, and Ma/Baba in Bengali or Hindi
e) the haldi (turmeric ceremony) was straight out of a Bollywood film. There was no turmeric powder in the 19th Century (I laughed so hard when I saw this). Why was the turmeric mixed with anything????F) the decoration on the hall floor (alpona) is again a Bengali touch. If it had been in colours it would be a Rangoli - more appropriate to MarathisAll of the above is easily available on Google.The arrogance of writers in imagining they could turn a fan favourite into something ""better"" is breathtaking.I have no wish to see anymore Bridgerton stories on screen. I'm sure they will be equally mangled.",5
Filled with electric chemistry,"Amazing Netflix series. Totally in love with it.Like many other reviewers, I simply don't understand some of the poor ratings for this series. It was an incredible production with an excellent cast & beautifully shot, with stunning music.",10
Exquisite,"I binge watched the show in a day and then crashed into YouTube too see multifandom about the characters. Some commented that creators should stick to the original characters' appearances, however I have to say that seeing people don't judge by their skins color made me so happy. First in ""The Great"", then "" Bridgeton"". Keep making these true pieces of art. Moreover I can't explain how I loved the chemistry between Daphne and Simon. Costumes, decorations, casting all wonderful. I can't wait to see second season",10
I cannot believe how bad it is,"Watched the 1st episode a couple of nights ago and couldn't believe how bad it was. Dreadful acting, no proper storyline, absolutely terrible. Like a fluffy pink American attempt at drama. Someone put it in the same bracket as Poldark ????? To mention it in the same. Sentence is an insult. That's an hour of my life I will never get back again.",
Manage your expectations and it can be entertaining,"People in these reviews here should calm down. No this series is not historically accurate at all and it won't win any awards for writing or acting, but it is a refreshing (American) take on a soapy costume drama, with teenage girls as the target audience. Prepare for classical interpretations of modern songs of artists like Ariane Grande and Billie Eilish, over the top costumes and styling, and a very ethnically diverse cast, as is to be expected from Netflix and in this time. I've only seen 20 minutes of it and know it's not for me, but it looks beautiful and I'm sure teenagers can have fun watching it. They might even feel empowered by finally seeing people of color in high positions in a classical costume drama. Manage your expectations and give it a try!",7
A fun watch!,"The first episode is a little slow and I was a little confused but once you get all the characters straight it's actually pretty good. No, it's not historically accurate but I didn't tune in because it's a ""period piece"" I read that it was basically the 1800s London version of Gossip Girl which I thought was a pretty accurate description. All the characters are pretty likeable, definitely keeps you entertained, and the episodes usually end in a cliffhanger that make binging pretty easy.",8
Look beyond the controversy,"Found myself home alone for a week and was looking for a guilty pleasure to indulge in. I had started Bridgerton previously and thought it wasn't for me after the first episode but decided to give it another try. Once I got past episode 2 I was very much into it!I haven't read the books associated with this series but understand from other reviewers that each book is based on a different Bridgerton sibling.Season one is good. The stories weaving around it kept me interested, there's lots going on.Season two....mmmm, not so good. Second seasons always have a lot to live up to anyway but for me, I found the character of Kate Sharma to be highly irritating. I disliked her so much I didn't want it to be a happy ending for her and was hoping that she would die after her riding accident to bring an end to all this unnecessary farce and make things a bit more interesting. This is nothing to do with the capable actress who portrays her but the way she was delivered to us in the series. I couldn't understand why Anthony would want to marry the older, sour, grumpy, irritating and troublesome sister when the younger one was so kind, pretty and nice. None of it made any sense.Overall, the series is slick, beautiful, funny, charming and sexy. The costumes and scenery are amazing and the musical score is wonderful. I'm looking forward to season 3.If you look beyond the controversy you will find a fun, light and entertaining series, which is exactly what it was meant to be.",7
New Gossip Gril,"I was afraid to watch another Netflix series without having prejudices but since I have nothing exciting to watch, I decided to do so. And with great surprise, this tv show is refreshing, magnificent, I even watched it twice.
The music is amazing, the love scenes too.
A must watch",9
Second season is a drag,"The first season is pretty good, the broody and mysterious Duke giving off some nice Mr Darcy/Rochester vibes, making the romance between he and the innocent debutante feel dangerous and intriguing. His reasons for being a jerk are pretty lame, but at least they pose a mystery that creates some genuine tension.The second season? Awful main plot. The two leads have misguided senses of duty and the entire conflict is just them insisting that they have to conform to those imaginary constraints while people around them tell them that's stupid (which it is). Because their 'duties' aren't socially binding, it's not enough conflict to hold together eight episodes and after awhile it's just annoying to watch them self-sabotage over such small potatoes. Surely society was constraining enough back then that they could have come up with something with a little more jazz.",6
Amazing!!!,"As a lover of the books I was so ready to see the family I have fallen in love with come to life. Is it exactly like the books no BUT as an avid reader that has watched many adaptations this did not disappoint!!! While there are variations from the book they are great ones! I follow the author on social media so I knew going in she loved it so I went into it with an open mind. I can't get over how much I loved it!!! The colors are beautiful, actors are not exactly as I picture them but as I continued to watch I felt they fit better than I had imagined. I was also worried how they would handle putting 8 books into a series because I know it will more than likely not last 8 seasons. They included bits from the other books beautifully to satisfy this reader and those new to it to keep them interested. I can't tell you enough how amazing this was!!! Thank you Ms. Quinn for allowing your books to come to life!!! I hope many people are happy too so that we may see the rest of the books come to life!",10
It's cute,"This isn't the worst show in the world, and it's definitely not the best. I've seen reviews comparing this to outlander, and sorry, it's no comparison. Outlander is far superior.8/10 - fiction standpoint: as a work of fiction, it's a fun story. There are characters we love, and others...not so much. The pace isn't dragging, and it's a cute love story.2/10 - historical standpoint: from costumes to race, this is not historically accurate. And that rubs wrong quite a few people. While it's a fictional story, there are real historical people represented in a time period that was also real. For those that love history/historical fiction, it's hard to move past.If you want a cute love story no matter the time period, with the drama of gossip, then you'll probably love this show. If you are looking for a historically accurate show like pride and prejudice, outlander, or downtown abbey, then this show is probably not for you.",6
Levels of cringe,"Season 2 felt slightly less cringe but also less raunchy for those that are watching for that factor.Getting used to the casting and appreciate it better without the often wooden facial expressions or RJP.Have to keep reminding myself that it's based on a romance novel and appreciate it for what it is - and not keep getting distracted by dresses which appear to have zips, behaviour which wouldn't occur in that era and all the character depth of a shallow dish of water.I enjoyably binged both seasons nonetheless and found less reason to cringe in season 2.",5
Well-pleased Fan: I.Am.Enthralled,I love this!! A true romance novel come to life...it has EVERYTHING.,10
Excellent Adaptation,"It is so refreshing to see characters and not colour, follow the storyline and not reflect on history, but escape our realities for a season.Bridgerton, is a 'what if' fantasy adaptation of an era gone by where the 'Ton' set the standard for respectability, acceptability, societal mores and rules of engagement.What if Prince Harry and Megan Markel were born over 100 years before their time (and Harry was in direct line for the throne?) then Slavery in the West Indies would have ended a lot sooner and not even been considered in the American Colonies. What we would have is a society filled with rich colourful characters that should be told.After all, we are only limited by our own imagination.",10
Hollywood being hollywood,Should have made it more realistic for the place and time period. But once again Hollywood has to impose their social justice narrative! I started to watch it and quickly realized how unrealistic it was and what Netflix was once again doing with their racial obsession. How about we remake Roots and Porgy snd Bess with all white actors!,
Better lead actress would change the whole experience for me,"There are a lot of aspects of this period drama to be criticized but i'm here to make a shallow comment on the lead actress. I've loved much worse quality period dramas if actors brought the emotions to me. But this Daphne girl...she's like a formless white piece of canvas , she looks like twelve and it's so awkward to watch her live an ""adult"" life.",6
Great show but be careful because you will binge it!,"Idk why people are upset that the show is not the exact same as the books, that's kind of the point of adaptation. The creative liberties from what I have observed were great! The show is bright, the story lines are not difficult to follow, and you really do feel immersed in this world.I think at times some things were a little annoying, but overall I would say the show is pretty good! Also if you're mad that the cast is diverse....just don't watch the show. I found that part to be especially cool since looking back at history would tell a different story. We can kind of imagine a world where all people are treated similar, are able to have similar ranks, and basque in their individuality (I mean seriously just look at allllll the different hair styles and textures it's really beautiful).Good job Shondaland!",9
Everyone is entitled to a bit of fantasy,"Let's suppose that this historical mess is due to a moment of fantasy of its creators, as ridiculous as the Queen and her wigs.Do not forget that People of the dark race did not inhabit the palace but in the form of servants and that thousands of Hindu people succumbed to the British ""conquest"". And that while our ghost writer was taking her gossip to print, vast numbers of poor people were dying from the filth and coal in the London suburbs. Too bad the British did not inherit the old French custom of the guillotine.But then, that was long, long ago... (was it..? )",6
Worth The Watch!!,"Not understanding the hate at all. I thought this was a very good show to watch on a Sunday evening. It has a good mix of drama, romance and thrill. I loved seeing Daphne and Simon's relationship grow throughout the series, while also seeing the other characters unfold. It's a perfect historical drama. People should not be so focused on the historical details and rather enjoy the series for what it is! It's worth the watch if u like intense romance and drama.",8
You guys are funny (not in a good way),"First off, question for those complaining about historical accuracy over a purely fictional story: black aristocrats are an inaccuracy, but string quartet covers of Ariana Grande and Taylor are historically spot on? Give us a break from your racism and pettiness.As for the show, I find myself not liking Shonda's work more often than not, but I've managed to willingly sit through this one because it is a time period I'm most interested in (Pride & Prejudice is one of my all-time favorite movies). I appreciate the elements that give the show a slightly modern twist for a period that is usually portrayed as completely modest and proper. The setting is visually beautiful and it's refreshing to see a diverse and eclectic cast (reminds me of Brandy's Cinderella). The plot is standard yet I enjoy these little matchmaking/suitor storylines, and I'm interested in seeing more of the show.",7
BINGE WORTHY,"Not one to normally write a review but I have to say I loved this show.. I normally watch things like TVD, criminal minds and veronica Mars.This caught me off guard and did not think I would enjoy, but couldn't stop watching!",9
Half the charm of the books,"If you like romance, read the book series which are phenomenal. The series captured maybe a quarter of the charm and humour and the characters are less likeable. I still enjoyed it, but if i want to relive daphne and Simon's story i'll pick up the books instead next time.",7
Alternate reality,"I understand the negative reviews for this show, because historically speaking it is inaccurate, but that does not mean it is not very entertaining.
You should see this as een alternate reality.
The show takes place in the regency era.
In that time, how awful it may be, there were no people of colour who were queens, dukes, lords and ladies.
Although it's not really how things went down in this era, it sure is a lot of fun to see things in a different perspective.
I loved seeing people of colour in this show without them being the help.
I also loved how the show used very recent songs by artists such as Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande in a classic style to fit the era.
If you love shows like Gossip Girl but you're also into costume drama's, please do watch this, 'cause it really is a lot of fun.
The acting is great, the costumes are wonderful and the storyline, although being a little predictable, is very exciting.",9
Great adaptation of historical romance novels,"I never thought the books could be adapted to a tv series. But I was wrong. The series is as romantic and sexy as the books. And no. It's not historically correct. But for all the critics : the show is based on historical romance novels which are set in the regency era, but are not historically accurate at all themselves. They are pure FANTASY!! So I think the series did a very good job.
First I was surprised to see Simon played by a non-white actor. But he was totally convincing ....and super hot ;) I just wished they had focussed more on his stammering problem which did play a big role in the book.
I am very much looking forward to the next season and Anthony's story.",9
Interesting Alternative History,"This will not appeal to the average viewer of historical drama. This series is playing with culture and our assumptions about culture rather than portraying an accurate historical version of the time.The acting was fine, especially much of the supporting cast; the story a bit predictable; and while some of the script was nicely written, in other parts it was cringe-worthy.***Minor spoilers ahead.
I'm a fan of alternative history stories--they make me think, and question my assumptions. (I'm speaking of the Queen, wife to King George, being a PoC and the the possibilities this opens up for other PoCs.) Not that this was the focus of the story; it formed the background, and was mostly taken for granted rather than discussed. Other anachronisms included women being assertive, lots of modern-style swearing, and modern-Hollywood-style sex (both in quality and quantity).",7
Had to write a review because of the 5.7 rating,"This show is well made, nice costumes, good actors. It deserves at least 7 stars or more. Love the soundtrack as well. Some people are just haters for no reason.",9
Good for what it is,I can't believe all the self righteous reviews. This isn't a historical documentary. It is a lite romantic comedy and should be reviewed that way. It has it's fun moments and it's melodramatic moments. But it is not historically accurate. Who cares? It is fun.,7
People Need To Chill,"This was a fun series. I think there are too many angry British people rating this series and people want to call it racist or offensive but it's exactly the opposite. Of course none of this took place the way it's staged in the show. It's a SHOW. Relax. It's not meant to be accurate. It's making something old new again and fun for a new generation to enjoy. If you take it for what it is, you'll enjoy it. It's a modern take on old times. It's fun. Nothing is accurate for the time from the clothes to the casting to the storyline itself, but it's a great watch. I loved the costumes, the actors were really enjoyable to watch, I binged it in a day. Julie Andrews is a great pick for the narrator and even the orchestra pieces are updated with compositions of Ariana Grande's ""Thank You, Next"" in the background. If you're no fun than you won't enjoy it. If you want an accurate period piece watch PBS and get over yourself.",9
Proceed with caution...,"If you are expecting a straightforward period drama, Bridgerton, essentially Pride & Prejudice caught with its bloomers down may be a bit of a shock. Bridgerton isn't awful. It's very addictive and is essentially an historical soap opera with decent acting and a big budget. Much has been made of the fact that it's set in an alternate version of the Regency period in which slavery was abolished earlier than it actually was, allowing for a much more diverse ruling class. However this is never really referenced within the plot and remains entirely superficial. We live in a time where people don't really question the authenticity of what is presented to them in historical dramas. I can imagine that there will be many people who will view Bridgerton and not realise that they are watching an alternative history and will believe that Regency period society was more racially egalitarian than it actually was. The ugly history of slavery is still not taught in many schools and remains the shameful secret that we find more comfortable to brush under the carpet. We can't change history but we can at least have an honest discourse about it. Historical dramas are not a one stop shop; they are great jumping off points to start learning about history, but you still have to do research if you want the truth. Whilst I don't imagine the makers of Bridgerton were ever intending to create a serious historical drama, there remains the possibility that a great many viewers will not go on to scratch the surface of this period of British history. It's good to see a diverse cast, but I can't help wondering if there will ever be TV dramas and films made to tell the actual histories of POC in Britain, histories that have been sidelined for too long. POC have lived in Britain for 2000 years since the days of the Roman Empire. Emperor Severus who was more important in the history of Hadrian's Wall than Hadrian himself was not white, a fact that was at best overlooked by many for a long time. The film Belle (2013) told one such story; that of Dido Elizabeth Belle, a woman who might easily have been lost to history. So many true stories are being left untold. Bridgerton is a lot of fun, it looks beautiful and is very addictive...but don't for one moment think this is how the past REALLY was. Once you've binge watched it (and you will), switch off Netflix and read a book about the history of the period for an accurate view of how the Regency period really treated POC.",6
Refreshing and wonderfully entertaining,"Thoroughly enjoyed it despite the deviations from the book which include the new characters, a contemporary twist to ensure a diversely inclusive perspective (though not reflective of the Victorian era), the music, and certain plot lines ie marina. Storylines brought forward from other books in Julia Quinn's Bridgeton series allows the audience to get to know the characters better. Wonderful sets and loved the energy of the actors who did justice to their characters as in the books. However, didnt really enjoy the Queen's character, a bit of a nuisance. I do hope the next seasons are made more in keeping with the original story lines of the author..eg would love to see Kate and also Benedict and Sophie stories etc. Well done though! It is after all fiction and thus should be regarded as such..and the books are definitely worth a read if ones like this genre.",9
Boring Rubbish,The only thing enjoyable is the set and costume design. Incredibly boring and predicable plot. I guess the high ratings come because we are mainly forced at home and people want to escape and dream? Amazed it's actually making season 2!,6
Some weird Jane Austin meets Gossip Girl?,"Honestly, it's not that bad after a few glasses of wine. I enjoyed watching a period piece with a racially diverse cast. However, if you're going to get rid of racism why not also get rid of misogyny, bigotry, and classism?",3
Binge-worthy,"Just binge watched season 2 over the weekend. Shondaland does it again! This series is definitely one of the more surprising ones to me. I literally clicked on it because I had no clue what to watch and wanted something to melt my brain to. But I was captivated instead!To be sure, season 1 is better. There is better writing, better character development, the story is fresh, even though if you've read one romance novel, you've read them all. Season 1 manages to be beyond that, it meets your expectations, but it exceeds them as well.Season 2 is a little less well written by comparison. Certain situations appear drawn out; there are several missed moments when characters could experience pivots in their approach to things (their pigheadedness notwithstanding); some events end up being sprung on us even though the build up to them was so long and tedious; some stories end up not being told (I'm looking at you, Penelope!); and some characters are down right ""out of character"" (for shame, Eloise!!!). I suppose the writers wanted to leave something to tell during season 3.On certain situations being drawn out for no good reason - the long glances, the internal turmoil between emotion and duty - we get it already. It makes sense for about two-thirds of the show, then it becomes just arduous and painful to watch. We expect certain characters to get together from the start; we just want to be taken on a fun journey observing how they get there; no need to complicate things artificially. Take Anthony's journey to the realization whom he really loves, and indeed the fact he LOVES someone at all. There were at least two moments in the show where he could have made the transition to understanding, and it wouldn't have seemed forced; also the Queen's role could have been better developed here. As it is, it seems almost like an afterthought. Some potential wasted.On certain events being sprung on us after an inordinate amount of time building them up - well, the ending really. As I mentioned earlier, we know what happens in a sense, we expect things to end a certain way, but we want a nice story that makes sense, without any shortcuts or plot twists that really don't make sense. The Queen suddenly being so open minded tied up loose ends, yes, but it wasn't a great script maneuver.On some stories not being told - Lady Whistledown gets her story, but not Penelope. Miss Calper, who seems to down on her luck yet again. Some characters are down right gone! I understand space must be made for new ones, but let's not dismiss the original ones quite so soon. Other characters are afforded so little meaningful attention that they go and do stupid things. Which brings me to my next subject.On certain characters being ""out of character"" - I had trouble making up my mind about Anthony at some point. It's not fun to follow a character's development, only to begin suspecting him of actually being a scoundrel, judging by his actions and decisions. However, all this is nothing compared to the terrible development of Eloise.I understand Eloise is meant to be a force for change and progress on the show. I don't know whether it's on purpose or not, but they way she has been written in season 2 represents everything we've learned to hate about feminism - which is, I suspect, what Eloise is meant to espouse. She is however so inconsistent, childish and obnoxious in her ways, I cannot possibly root for her. Not after the way she treats her best friend in the end. You'd think Eloise would be grateful, if indeed all of her disdain for the ""ton"" is real. Her actions in the season finale seriously make me wonder. She is indeed all bark and no bite; ironically, it is the soft-spoken, entrepreneurial Penelope that is the true feminist around.In case this was done on purpose, I can't wait to see how the writers rehabilitate Eloise in the next season. Guess we'll just have to wait and see. It might also be interesting to do a season from the servants' perspective, take a page from Downton Abbey so to speak.",8
Amazing!,"One of the best new shows to come out of 2020! Full of humour, intrigue and of course romance! Can't wait to hear about a s2!",10
🤢,"A lot can be done with one's life during the horrible long and boring time that Bridgerton series require to disappoint.That is all!The following words are here just to reach the 150 characters target needed for this review to be posted. So, please, don't consider anything written below.Bla bla bla... bla bla bla.",
Jane austen-esque for the new tick tock generation,"A show I'm fully engaged in though it doesn't have the refinement of a good classical show like PBS (It's more adolescent, colorful and flashy than that, which is it's true intentions it's not trying to be something else) it's definitely there to appease the younger crowd with its musical numbers that are clearly classical renditions of pop garb playing in the background as if trying to be clever. It can be a little distracting and corny but you accept it. It's as though they have made a sort of Jane austen-es que show for the new social media, tick-tock crazed generation and their short attention span. The show is geared on keeping them reeled in and does not get bogged down in any logistics, boring dialogue or long moments. Historically accurate? I don't know nor do I want to open that box but it certainly is a nice refreshing take. Everyone gets to be included and that's such a wonderful change, especially in movies and shows like this . My only complaint is the hesitant dialogue that the characters have. I get the feeling that they don't know what they are really saying when they're saying it. They're not really listening to what they're saying but more or less reading lines all while trying to sound very proper maybe a little too proper lol It comes off as if they're mocking the character. Sometimes it's as if they are saying their lines for the first time and there is this strange hesitance and confusion to the dialogue. I wish I didn't think so but if you pay attention you can see it. Sometimes I don't believe that the characters even believe what they are saying. Very script read. As though they are reading que cards out of the corner of their eye. It could almost pass for bad acting. It's teetering on that line but I have to give it 7 stars for keeping my attention and keeping me entertained, It's pretty to look at. Also, there just doesn't seem to be anything else on TV in this covid year we are in. I'll put it to you like this-- the show is like choosing a trashy romance novel over something written by Edith Wharton. Sometimes you don't want to have to think that hard you just need something spoon fed to you and what's being spoon-fed to you is definitely prepackaged (not authentic or homemade) but good all the same. It's a guilty pleasure. It's hokey. But like watching reality TV, You don't want to admityou still enjoy it. It's a show that probably won't get lots of criticism because who cares? just watch it and enjoy it.",7
The negative reviews are unbelievable,"It's a tv show based on a fictional romance book series. Sorry to those of you so determined to keep period pieces strictly for white people 🙄. I enjoyed the blind casting and felt they did it well. If they can do it why can't most other tv shows out there?
And for the supposed black people upset about the blind casting, keep sucking up to master. It's a fictional character! Who cares what skin tone plays it?",10
Brilliant acting but..,"I love the books. I'm reasonably happy with the show but ... why the heck is there so much smoking to relax? Frankly it throws me so much out of the scene that I scarcely know what Eloise is saying. Honestly the time for cigarettes has come and gone. These are barely disguised. I'm probably the only person who doesn't think smoking is cool nor do I find it at all sexy or interesting,
Some of the casting choices probably piss folks off but I'm ok with such changes.",7
Refreshing,Loved everything about it. It was serious it was funny it was delicious. Everything you could want.,10
Not painful,Why those songs horrible dont suit at all dont they even have to pay for them. Useing an fifty shades resemblance not an smart move to use someone who already excist.But actors other hand were decent.Easily can watch this not painful.Dont know how they managed to get allmost hour long episode would have guessed like thirty minutes.,6
Amazing,"This show is charming, they managed to address current issues even though everything happened in the 19th century. The cast is impeccable and managed to clearly convey the essence of each character. The main couple Daphne and Simon passed a magical connection through the eyes and this makes any heart beating stronger. Long episodes, however, flow so quickly that they are not tiring. All my satisfaction for this show!",10
Sci-Fi/Fantasy pretending to be historical fiction,"If Bridgerton were set in the far future, on a different planet, or in an alternate universe, it would make more sense. Sadly it is none of those, yet still manages to entertain using sex and gossip as a foundation for poor writing. However, there is some excellent acting in places, but inconsistent accents abound.Indulge, but know Bridgerton, is at its base, a farce.",7
Absolute Drivel,"I can get over the fact that the Island of Britain suddenly has so many different races in it was almost unheard of for people to move country and only the very wealthy travelled. They certainly would not have been included in the London circuits unless they were royalty. What I can't forgive is the woeful lack of research done for the period. The language used is clearly a very poor American version of Regency English. The female undergarments were a mishmash of several eras and the outer garments of both sexes a fanciful version of the era. What made me decide to throw in the towel with this series though was the Duke being in the birthing room with the Duchess and a MALE doctor. Never, it would never have happened. There would have been a midwife and housemaids present. The husband would not have been anywhere near the birth and nor would he have wanted to be. A man seeing a woman's most intimate areas would have been totally forbidden, particularly in the upper classes. I just wish the Americans would leave our British history alone if they arent prepared to do the research. Oh and another thing, what the hell with the music and dancing? It's nonsense and the only reason to watch is the raging sex and nudity. Now that I firmly believe happened although not quite so blatantly!!!",1
!,"Overall I really enjoyed the series, the characters were interesting and all the scenes with the siblings were funny and realistic. Episode 6 was very problematic, and I wish they didn't include it. Also, the lgbt rep was pretty lousy, laughable even.",8
"Excellent, well written, cheeky","Yes, this is the Gossip Girl for 1813. To have such a brazen show with Dame Julie Andrews, the amazing narrator of this depiction of Regency Era London in Society Season, is absolutely brilliant. I love how the elements of Wendy Darling, Jane Austen, Much Ado, Cinderella, and the modern aspects of G.G. have been molded into this brilliant fictional historical dramady. The actors, writers, and directors work together in a perfect trifecta in an effervescent bubble of costumes and scenery. A diamond of a show.",10
THE BEST,Amazin how It looks like reading the books! So much loved!,
Its fine well made just a bit boring,"I found it quite hard to connect to this show. Something about the writing or the characters im not sure. Maybe it was a bit too americanised.
It looks like its had all the money in the world thrown at it but yet still somehow looks cheap.
Jonathan Bailey is always good in stuff he's in, he's definitely the best thing in this",6
Loved it!,"I want more 😊 it has the drama, the roman e and a great storytelling. Good actors too. I hope for at least a second season.",10
Don't watch if you want historical accuracy,"I feel this is a decent series but maybe not an excellent one. I never felt that this series intended to be historically accurate so that part didn't bother me. It started out a little slow but I did grow to like the characters. The storyline is sometimes a little far fetched but entertaining. If you're looking for a show that you can analyze and think deeply about, this is not the show for you. If you're looking for something fun and a little different, check it out.",6
Just what we needed for Lockdown 3.0 amazing!!!!,"If you loved Gossip Girl you will love this show, it has gossip, romance, a few racy scenes and The Duke of Hastings who is let's say easy on the eye.
If you want to switch of from what is happening to you around the world because you're sick of hearing about the virus and throw yourself back into a time where no one social distanced and the only mask that would of been worn would of been for a masquerade ball then this show should be at the top of your list.The comments below are not to be believed I could not stop watching this and had to get to the next episode, everyone is talking about Lady Whistledown who is she? I would spoil this and will let you all form your own opinion of who she can be! You won't be disappointed you will either be hooked in the first 5 minutes like I was or this show is not for you.....",10
Missing the Mark,"I was really excited about this show but, it missed the mark for me. I have read the book series numerous times and always loved the family dynamic and witty banter between the characters that Julia Quinn created but, the adapted script made all the characters real stiff, serious,, and unperson-able. Where they mostly stuck to the overall story-line of the first book ""The Duke &I"" they pulled certain sub plots from future books in the series to early, changed them or gave them way to much run time. The adding of the opera singer(very briefly from book 2) and Marina Thompson( important to Eloise's story in book 5, originally a Bridgerton Cousin) that were barely mentioned till later books and having them as main characters ; made Anthony and Colin unlikable for their future seasons. Adding the dressmaker, Mr. Featherton,and Prince Friedrich (who are not in the books at all) were totally pointless and gave no real substance to the story at all. Changing Ms. Danberry's role as a funny gossip to Queen Charlotte (anther character barely included in the books) was also a let down as she is featured throughout all the books and a very influential to the younger Bridgertons stories and the search for Lady Whistle-down. I hope for future seasons they stick more to the books storyline and not change it to include modern problems that contradict the time period and also bring more of the humor back to the writing and less of the non important sex scenes and unnecessary added side characters.",7
Too Smart for Some?,"I don't get why some people hate this show. It's well written, top level production and great acting.The top complaints I see are that the dialogue is bad, that it doesn't represent the age it is set in, and that it has too much drama.Bad dialogue? I think some people aren't used to big words and people not saying cuss words all the time.Era inaccuracies? Do some people not realize it's a dramatization of a fictional story? It's called taking liberties. Plus come on, it's a British themed showed produced for Americans. It's tailored that way for a reason. (I love the instrumental versions of modern songs.)Too much drama? It is a drama. From the creator of Grey's Anatomy.I think people can't enjoy it for what it is and that makes no sense.",10
"If you love all things Shondaland, then this is for you....maybe.","The pace is too fast, silly and somewhat comedic to me. I felt like I was watching a a mashup of all things that define Shonda Rhimes TV shows.It has jokes, steamy sex scenes, passion but the thing that struck me the most was the pace of the story. It was much too fast for me. I felt like the story had been rushed to the ER at Grey Sloan Memorial.I was really hoping for something more realistic, with a story that would capture you and keep you watching. I'm halfway through the first episode and feeling completely lost. It did not feel like a period piece but rather like a satire of one.I am a huge fan of the regency era and usually watch anything that is remotely similar in nature but I could not sit through this one. I am not even tempted to go try to figure out who is who and finish that first episode.Maybe when I feel like having a laugh at the era, I will try again.",7
Prepare yourself for Featherington instead of Bridgerton,"Side characters trump over the Main Leads in Bridgerton Season 2.To say Jonathan Bailey was robbed could be understatement. Bridgerton Season 2 is based on the book ""Viscount who loved me"" where Anthony played by Jonathan Bailey takes the lead. But unfortunately the screenplay did the opposite with his character in the new season. He had more presence in season 1 than what he got in S2. Instead too many unnecessary characters occupied the screen giving Anthony and Kate less importance in the whole 8 episodes. It was like the show is about the Featheringtons, Anthony and Kate are just fillers.Sometimes the adaptations are done with a twist to keep the audiences on their toes so that they can connect with the book but at the same time anticipating is there gonna be a twist. But this story got twisted so badly, was like watching an Indian soap opera. I don't mind the blunder of history as this is a fantasy show, but destroying the main characters like they did here, i do mind. As i said, Jonathan had more passion and presence in S1 than S2. He couldn't do justice to his lead role because of the poor screenplay, instead Luke Thompson stole the show every time he was on screen along with Claudia. Ashley did amazing with what she was given and she did somewhat do justice to kate but my biggest disappointment was the character Edwina. The cast was so bang on but the character, just out of an Indian soap. The Edwina of the book was totally erased and re-written as a whiny needy girl who just wanted to be the Viscountess, not the girl who wanted to marry a scholar and marry for love. Here out of nowhere she fell in love with Anthony and determined to get married to him. The love triangle was sooooooo unnecessary.These 3 were supposed to be the stars of S2, instead u gonna find they are the after thoughts cause somehow the writers thought showing the stories of Featheringtons, the queen, Will and his gentlemen club are more important than building the love story of Anthony and Kate. 8 episodes... They had 8 episodes to build the story but such missed opportunity.The on screen chemistry between Jonathan and Ashley is sizzling but audiences were also robbed from those cause there wasn't a lot of those steamy scenes in S2 like S1 when it was promised to audience that this season gonna be more bold and daring and scandalous, but it wasn't. Still the little screen time they got for showing chemistry, both Jonathan and Ashley nailed the longing for each other beautifully.But my disappointment still remains cause out of all the Bridgertons, i loved the story of Anthony and Kate, story of two strong willed people and how they fell in love despite Anthony being idiotic in some parts. The writers, director took the lovely story and managed to destroy it with their ""creativity"". So people, a fair warning, do not expect anything similar as the book other than the names. And those who thought gonna see some couple actions like Daphne and Simon, forget about it. Instead, be prepared to see Featherington instead of Bridgerton.",3
Worth the watch,"Absolutely loved watching this. The costumes, the acting, the story. I have never read the book but I do like the story very much that is being told. It's never boring as it switches between storylines and gives you multiple characters to pay attention to. I hope they come out with season 2.",10
Really enjoyable show,"After accepting the black aristocracy and that show even doesn't try to reflect the reality of 19th century I think this series was really fun and entertaining, story flow was really good. Not to mention the beautiful set and a dressing. Eight episodes went through in a jiffy leaving you to want more. Yes, I will definitely wait for season 2 to come!",9
I just Watched season 1 just for season 2.,Season 2 is way much better than season 1 in my opinion!The chemistry between the Kate and Anthony was just something.The connection between the family was so real.,
It's Binge-Worthy....On Booze,"I agree with whoever said this is fun to watch with a glass of wine. It isn't riveting drama. The characters' Jane-Austen-esque miscommunications (that end happily) are often more frustrating than understandable. The main couple lack real depth as individuals, particularly Daphne. Rene Jean-Page is one to watch and his acting surpasses hers. He gives it his all, but his character as written is kind of a Disney Regency Romantic Hero, with sex. There is always sex.That said, it's still very engaging. The costumes and sets are to die for. I mean, Daphne's dresses are cracking and seemingly endless. Most of the actors turn in fun performances. I particularly like Claudia Jessie (sp?) as the bookworm sister, and the actress who plays Penelope, the Queen and the Lady Who Orchestrates Everything (forgot her name, Lady Something). Everyone is beautiful and did I mention the costumes? The ""Lady Whistledown"" conceit/mystery works well enough and it's delightful to hear Julie Andrews voicing her.If they are going to do more seasons focusing on the other siblings, which it seems they will, given the success of the show, then the writers will really have to up their game with the male characters. I don't really blame the actors, but the Bridgerton brothers are not well-sketched and I don't particularly care about the happiness of any of them. Anthony is very handsome and has potential, but he acted like a dumb jerk for the first half of the season. Colin seems like a goofball. I do like the two youngest kids, though. They're adorbs.As for the diversity of the cast? I like it. This is not a historical drama. It's a romance set in a liberally altered historical era. It's a quasi-fantasy and should be viewed as such. If you want them to get the skin color and soup spoons perfect, watch Downton Abbey. That wasn't particularly realistic either, when you get down to it, but people act like it was Shakespeare or something. Come on.",7
"Very special, in a good way!","I really enjoyed this series. It was very special and different from a lot of other shows on Netflix, which I really liked. I don't understand the people who are writing that they are bad actors, I think the opposite. Also, the series is fiction, so why are people mad that the time is not historical correct, it doesn't have to be. I would definitely recommend this series if you are looking for something new and interesting.",10
Not up to the standard of Season One,"Bridgerton - Series 2My Rating 6/10
Gentle reader to quote Lady Whistledown
. ""You missed the most remarkable coup of the season."" and that would have been to have maintained the same standard script wise as Season One but in this season for me the icing on the cake was still delicious but the cake was stale.After initial misgivings I enjoyed Season One of this bizarre Colour-blind casting confection set in the 19th Century Regency era and gave it a 9/10.However for me the novelty of the lavish sets colourful costumes and bizarre character casting this time wore off quickly.One reason is the absence of handsome Regé-Jean Page as Simon Basset the Duke of Hastings .In this series he is nowhere to be found revealing in an interview with Variety, he said that he knew his time on ""Bridgerton"" was going to be short-lived because he only had a one-season deal.The other reason I got bored in this season was the lack of story line . The plot mainly evolves around the love triangle of Anthony Bridgerton and the Sharma sisters Kate and Edwina and apart from the late get rich scheme of Lady Portia Featherington to gain her lost fortune back it just doesn't go anywhere ?While Jonathan Bailey is handsome as Anthony Bridgetown he's nowhere near as dynamic as Regé-Jean Page and the quest for Lord Anthony Bridgerton to choose a suitable wife which begins in the first episode gets tired after 8 episodes.Simone Ashley is lovely as Kate Sharma sister of Edwina Sharma played by Charithra Chandran Edwina is the ""diamond debutant ""chosen by Queen Charlotte played with delicious disdain by Golda Rosheuvel.Her scene's especially with the equally regal Lady Danbury played by Adjoa Andohmake are the most delightful part of Bridgerton for me.I know 8 million viewers switch on to this very successful series but do those 8 million stay with it ? You only have to click on once to Netflix to be a viewing statistic.I'll look forward to Series 3 to see if there's an improvement and if I was the script writer I would be exploring the marriage of Queen Charlotte and King George 3rd more as the few scenes in this series featuring James Fleet as the King were interesting and could be an entertaining addition to the story.",6
Literally the best,This series is amazing!! My expectations were high but they surprised me even more!! The actors showed us in a perfect way how the characters felt and everything was similar to the books! Regé was the best Simon I could've imagine!! Simply perfect!,10
It's ok,"It's an interesting fantasy world the writer concocted set in England in 1813.... racism doesn't seem to exist, but sexism, misogyny and even fat phobia are out in full force. It would have been nice to eliminate other elements of the patriarchy like women's lack of agency and autonomy, lack of life or career choices, unrealistic beauty standards, child brides for old men, etc that caused women such extreme suffering back then and still persist today. A complete gender role reversal would have been amazingly fun to watch.This show was somewhat easy to watch if you enjoy period pieces... gorgeous costumes and settings in nearly every scene. However, it seemed utterly incomplete to play with race while still upholding the majority of patriarchal standards. It's tiresome to continue to glorify misogyny on television.",6
Blissful Entertainment,"I have completed 3 episodes and think this show is delightful. I came here to see the reviews and am completely gobsmacked to see how many people are twisted up about historical inaccuracy and reducing the great casting of this show as merely an attempt to be PC. I am fairly certain this is a fictional story line and the beauty of fiction is the freedoms that it can allow. How wonderful to see a genre I love so much set in a wonderful place where no one bats an eyelash at race. There is intrigue, chemistry, humor, and conflict all set in a beautiful place with magnificent costumes. It is escapism. It is pure entertainment. Shed your stuffy, dated expectations and exclusivity and take a breath of fresh air. I cannot wait to finish this!",10
Daphyne?,Daphne is cute but not the beauty she should be. She would not bring everything to a stop when she entered a room.,7
"WTF is this sh**? The description of ""Political correctness""?","There's no historical accuracy whatsoever. I'm a big fan of aesthetics, and it's the reason why I gave this show a chance. What a disappointment. The music; classical Ariana Grande? Please kill me.I haven't hated a show before, but now I can say that I do. It's historically so inaccurate, that some people that watch this, probably start thinking that Queen Charlotte was really black.I get it - they wanted to make a historical show, but a FUN one so zoomers can hop on the bandwagon! What's the point in choosing a specific time period, if you're not going to keep it accurate in any way?If the show had time traveling or something I would've rated it soooooo differently, now it just left me feeling uncomfortable.",1
Perfect,"That's it. Just perfect. Watch it. I've seen it all at once on Netflix. The books are quite good too, but you don't have to read it to watch the show.",10
"Enjoyable, highly recommend! Dont let the racist ppl distract you!","If you are looking for historical accuracy this isn't for you.
If you are looking for a show with gorgeous costumes, sets, and a damn sexy leading man who happens to be black...this is a dream come true. The casting truly feels like ""right actor, dont care what their race is"".
The actors are perfectly cast, the chemistry between Simon and Daphne is strong, and the humor *just right*. Wonderful adaptation!FAQ:
Yes they ""explain"" why black people are in positions of power. No they do not focus on race, truly it is only mentioned 1x (maybe twice?) and never any talk about biracial couples. In this world people are just people.Yes there is sex. A lot of it. Dont watch with your mom if you aren't comfortable seeing sex scenes--lots of naked male butts, some boobs, thrusting and seeing a man go down on a woman. It's intense for like, 5min montage and a little bit at the start of episode 1.Yes there are major changes from the book. They don't lose any of the important pieces and the changes make sense for a TV show-- new characters help move the plot forward and new story lines flesh out the siblings we didnt get to know in book 1. Approach this show like a fan's retelling of the story and you can enjoy it.Can't wait for season 2!",9
"Not my favorite, but entertaining.","I have not read the books, thus I had no expectations. I just finished the series and went through the comments. Why so much hate? Because the books were better? So what? I must admit that I have observed many fallacies and mistakes concerning the time period, characters etc. but I found the episodes very entertaining. I found the chemistry between the 2 main characters incredible and this was the main reason I liked the show. Get over yourselves people and judge based on the show's actual value, not the closeness to the books.",
Bingeworthy fun- point is missed by many.,"Vinerika your comment about Jane Austin is ignorant & ridiculous. She didn't write this, Julia Quinn did!
It's a refreshing modern take on a period drama , mixing purposely black & white people for effect which works really well.
This is easily a 7-8 out of 10 it's well acted by ALL , good romance , good story, intriguing and quite raunchy in places.
I enjoyed it so bloody there!",7
Does anyone remember fun?,"My goodness, so many horrible, angry reviews. Yes, the show can be a bit over-the-top and frivolous but it's also charming, light and FUN! Does anyone remember fun? Must every show be edgy, gritty and dark? Bridgerton is much like an enjoyable summer read. It is escapism at its best and most enjoyable when it is most needed and still touches on life, love and family moments we have all been through. I suggest that if you do not have a sense of humor, as so many seem to have lost, this show is not for you. Try Peaky Blinders, perhaps.",10
Not deserving of all the hate!,This alternative history-series is a treat for anyone who likes to get pulled into a good and inspiring story. The acting is exquisitely good. I especially liked Nicola Coughlan's and Claudia Jessie's performances. All characters are really brought to life quite well and their character arches are well-developed! I highly recommend diving into this alternative dimension.,7
The Challenge Here is Upon the Viewer,"I have seen the first episode, and while it did present a few false notes, overall, it was quite good. Indeed, I think the false notes were likely due almost purely to my own limitations regarding race. The series challenges viewers to disabuse themselves of the modern meaning of race, and become absorbed with the interior lives of the characters. It is not like Hamilton, which merely presses modern urban culture upon the American Revolutionary Era. Bridgerton leaves the feel of the Regency Era intact, but simply invites viewers to throw away the shackles of race and enjoy the drama. Skin colour here becomes as meaningless as hair and eye colour.If you find yourself cringing, consider looking inward rather than condemning the series. I discovered that when I assumed the insignificance of race, as the series does, I began to see mere humans with dark skin negotiating relationships with brown-eyed or light-skinned humans, and humans with blond or dark hair. Once I went out of my way to assault and then kill the meaning of race, a new and marvelously fresh experience emerged.",9
Delightful,"Entertaining love story. Well written and acted with visually excellent sets and costumes. Those wigs! Delicious, delightful, emotional and sometimes funny. Very enjoyable.",6
Finally A historical romance series in all its passionate glory!,"Finally we have a historical romance series which doesn't shy away from showing steamy and passionate scenes. This adaptation of Julia Quinn's acclaimed Bridgerton books is so much more than I had hoped it would be. The colours, the costumes, the music, the set design is vibrant and fairy tale like. This has drama, romance, gossip and well written characters that a romance lover will surely enjoy. Can't wait for S2.",9
It's not terrible but definitely not that great either,"At first it looked intriguing but I was forced to skip many scenes cause it got cringeworthy at some point. However, it's not terrible, you can watch it if you're bored and looking to kill some time.",7
Froth,Frothy American soap fantasy with curious cultural misappropriations - I got through half of episode one before deciding life was too short and precious.,1
Great fun,"I binged it one sitting. I loved how the characters interacted with each other, I loved the costumes, and I thought Daphne and her Simon had a great on screen chemistry.",9
The Plot - Will they or won't they make it,"I have now watched this two times in less than a week. The characters, the story, and the actors make the series. Rege-Jean is superb as Simon and his chemistry with Daphne is exquisite. You pine for them to find their was back to each other. You want them to win at love. I couldn't wait for the next season so I'm reading the second book for now. You won't be disappointed.",10
Confusion,I appreciate the concept but as s period piece it took too long to understand it wasn't. Sorry.,
I would prefer period music,I don't have a problem with the cast diversity (Hamilton?) I wish they would have used the music of that period as it would have introduced music that many of the viewers have not heard before instead of bad arrangements of mediocre popular songs. I just watched the first episode. It's OK. The acting seems forced and not really believable but the costuming and sets are pleasant to look at. The plot is somewhat intriguing and the fact that Julie Andrews is the narrator will probably keep me watching this.,6
Lovely!,Definitely worth watching. Great actors and actions. Love it!,10
Lol,"Kind of like a mashup of Gossip Girl + Pride and Prejudice with some of the trashiness of Fifty Shades. Also follows the formula of girl meets perfect boy with a Problem, girl wants to fix Problem. In this case, it's girl desperately and *forcibly* fixes the Problem.I couldn't get into it the first time I tried, but gave it a go again after my brain was fried from doing taxes. Ended up enjoying it mostly because of the actors' great chemistry. Also, the Duke (Page) is some serious eye candy and god knows I'm thirsty after almost a year of this dang pandemic. Yippee!",7
Fantasy period piece with color,"I have always enjoyed period pieces, but wouldn't it be fun to see one with black people in lead roles? For me, the answer is ""Yes!"" and Bridgerton delivers on that fantasy.Not to be taken too seriously, the series is fun, sexy, and entertaining. It offers eye candy with over-the-top wardrobe and wigs. In a time when things are challenging and there is quite a bit of negativity on TV, it's nice to have a fun and colorful escape.",9
Highly Entertaining,"It may lack a certain BBC finesse for the purists (even aside from the ""rule-breaking"" sex scenes) yet is very watchable all the same, has a valuable take on race & love vs. responsibility plus is funny. The acting, costumes, characters, writing & sets are all above par, so if you're looking for an entertaining period drama, this is it!",7
Fun to watch,The show got very bad reviews but it was actually smooth and fun to watch.,9
Secondary Characters Carried the Series,"I've never read the books, but I was really enjoying the series as a whole until Daphne basically rapes Simon in episode 6 and the remaining episodes obviously have to deal with the fallout. I've since found out that something similar happens in the books, so it's accurate to the text, but it really turned me off from the rest of their arc in the series. I'd be interested in watching another season of the show, but primarily for the secondary characters in this season. I was immediately intrigued by Eloise Bridgerton, Benedict Bridgerton, Colin Bridgerton, and Penelope Featherington and, following episode 6, these characters, along with the sibling relationships and friendships between these characters, really carried the series for me.",7
neither minimally historically accurate nor even good,"This is very BAD AND UNREAL the miscast cast spoils any historical immersionthe plot the writing is as deep as a tea saucer, the acting is hammy, the cinematography is cheapjust another netflix trsh.",1
Absolutely fantastic,"Absolutely fantastic show, for lovers of the books and the new finders through the Netflix series. Julia Quinn's fantastic and well loved Bridgerton series was wonderfully turned to film by the people at Shondaland and gave it a new light. The brothers and sisters of the Bridgerton family tell their stories in a steamy way, and you get to see them in a new light. Best thing that's come out this year!",10
"Great series, story similar to the book, good actors. I loved","The series is good, the actors are good and the story was not the same as the book but it remained similar. I saw all the episodes in one day. It is a romance, a fiction, it does not need to be faithful to the history of the time, it can be represented by actors of all colors. Simon is perfect, Lady Danbury too, they are by the way very similar to their personalities books.",10
Love Story,"Enjoyable Fluff to cheer you up in these troubled times! It is reminiscent of Jane Austin, it probably isn't historically accurate, but it it is easy to watch, it is funny in parts, it is gloriously romantic, the main characters are very easy on the eye and I have watched it several times! In the interest of forming a considered opinion! I have read the first few books & the story on screen is mainly true to the authors original.
Next season please. We need more Anthony and Benedict in our lives",
I liked Season 1 but Season 2 is better,"Just binge watched season 2 and it was really ok, but the plot with Lord Featherington was just boring. Eloise & Penelope were ok,
But they should develop Benedict's plot better I also thought it was kinda boring
I liked Kate and Anthony's story, he is very delightful to watch, and their chemistry was very good.",7
PERFECTION,"The show is perfect
The caracters, the cast, every things was made for us with so much care and atention
I loved It
Can't wait for the next season",10
Easy to laugh at also really cringe,"When I started this show I thought would be kind of funny to laugh at because I didn't think it would be very good, and I was bored. So, I tried it, it was all right I kind of enjoyed it but it's really kind of meh. There isn't much character development the most character development I saw was from one of the Bridgerton brothers Anthony. Overall the show itself is pretty cringy to watch. On a more positive note it can be fun sometimes. It's not the worst show I've ever seen but it's also not the best. It really reminded me of a Harlequin romance book. If you don't enjoy shows with a lot of drama and romance you are not gonna enjoy this. There's also a lot of nudity that I think is a little unnecessary but overall, not bad, not great either.",7
Incredible costumes!,"Love this show! So captivating and entertaining but above all else, the costumes are simply out of this world! The whole show is such a feast for the eyes.",10
Jane Austen meets Fifty Shades of Grey meets Gossip Girl,"A fantastic cast, wonderful costumes and production design, a lovely score, narrated by Julie Andrews, lots of romance and very steamy sex scenes. Can't wait for future seasons.",7
10 Stars for Excellence and BIPOC Representation,"What a marvelous show! My copies of the Bridgerton series are but remnants of the pristine books I picked up nearly a decade ago. I applaud how very well done the show is so far and I hope it continues this way or better. As an Asian American actress, it gives me hope to see that Hollywood is choosing more BIPOC talent for such roles.It's time for change. Change is progressive.",10
Anachronistic dialogue.,"I see there are many comments on how liberties have been taken with the depiction of life in those times, as well as criticisms of the quality of the dialogue, but what offended me was the Americanised script. One example: the use of ""momentarily"" instead of ""in a moment"". That is not British usage.I was surprised too to see Simon by the bedside while Daphne was giving birth. That certainly would not have occurred in those days.",6
not even close to the work of jane austen,"In addition to the miscast cast that is honestly so unrealistic, the series doesn't follow the book even in minimal details The series doesn't follow the books on basically ANYTHING it's just another netflix bait, nothing new under the sun and acting is terrible!",1
"The diversity, the music...","So disappointing to see all of these bad reviews. Full disclosure, I have never read the books, but I can understand that some people may get attached to their personal idea of a character. However, I (and perhaps anyone else who has an imagination and loves when modern touches are added to periodic tv shows/movies - ie: The Knight's Tale) absolutely love it. The chemistry between Simon and Daphne is untouchable. Their storyline is heartfelt and lovely. I love all the characters, although some of their storylines are a tad bit boring but I imagine they will get better as the show continues.
I urge anyone with an open mind (and heart) to give this stunning show a chance.",10
Very Baz Lurhmann-esque. Pleasantly surprised!,"I think the intensity of the negative reviews comes from viewers who had read the book. As is typical for book loyalists, regardless of which adaptation, they are simply incapable of a fair review. IMO.
Likewise, Pride and Prejudice/Downton Abbey fans are going to be hard on this show. This series was never meant to be historically accurate. It was meant to be hyperbole.
I'm a big fan of Baz Luhrmann's style, and this reminded me so much of his movies. It's a cross between his Romeo and Juliet, or Moulin Rouge, and perhaps Sofia Coppola's Marie Antionette.
Simon is perfectly cast, and his intensity and commanding presence set the bar high for the rest. Eloise is a close second. She almost steals the show.
Ignore the naysayers, and give it a chance!",9
Pride and Prejudice,"I am a HUGE fan of the 1985 version of Pride and Prejudice. So I went into this with a bit of trepidation.Look past the diversity of colours when it comes to the actors and ignore them and you have a show that very well done. We should all look past the colour of skin anyway, the world would be a better place if everyone did, so there is a lesson in the casting of this show right there.Putting all that aside the show is very well done, so much so that I binge watched it in one setting, not once but twice. The third time I took a more leisurely pace with my other half.Pride and Prejudice it is not, but it is close enough that I will be watching it many more times in the future and look forward to another season.An easy 8/10 and well worth multiple viewings.",
I hope I had known it is based on those soft-cover novels for women...,"After Downton Abbey and The Tudors I think I just expected too much. Until the end I was waiting for something complicated and meaningful. No way. It is based on a series of soft-cover books for women (which I, being myself a woman, can read from time to time), and gives only that - a romantic story, with the simplest plot and very predictable storyline. Not bad, but the wows around it seem for sure exaggerated.
I can hardly guess what caused all the excited reviews. Yes, it is beautifully shot, yes, the actors are pleasant to watch at, yes, different nationalities are represented just like in everyday life, but nothing more than that.
I can only thank the authors that they made it only 8 episodes long, where they could make 28 episodes of this soap opera easily. 8 episodes is an advantage.
I think it is better to watch Bridgertons without reading all the excited reviews before that, and then it can be a light and entertaining pastime. However, I would not want to watch it again.",7
Amazing,"I just loved it
Exactly what was needed during lockdown
Ignore the negative comments and binge watch it like the other 60mil+ viewers did",10
Splendid,"Brilliant costume, sets, scriptwriting and acting. Could do without the 'skin colour' speech in episode 4, I'd come to terms with it not being historically accurate in the first 20 minutes - I didn't need an explanation. The splendour is just lovely and I really enjoyed immersing myself in this series. A good series about love and responsibility.",7
Gossip Girl meets Emma,"So in love with this show! Great acting, characters, costumes, and spicy scenes. And the music is the perfect touch to this steamy faux-historical drama.I especially love the diversity among the characters and the rewriting of how history could have been.",10
Unexpectedly ok and watchable,"Seems that there are alot of bad reviews regarding historical accuracy of the show. Once you get over the character's skin color and see them as a human being (which we should do) there is a romantic series here. The show is not a historical piece. Its a romantic story. There is something for everyone here, as it is in every production these days to attract maximum viewership. There is white, black, brown, Asian, straight, gay, femenist, masculine, skinny, fat, family, friendship and every thing in between. Don't be offended, think of it as a parallel universe. The other complain in the reviews is that its not true to the books. Guess what, I didn't know the books existed untill I came here and read the reviews. I see the series as a stand alone work. I have never read a romantic novel and probably never will. However, I enjoyed this series. It is romantic love story which brought tears to my eyes more than once. It is extremely simple and straightforward. Its colorful. There is not much mystery. Its just simple romantic dialog. Unfortunately, the series loses momentum in the last two episodes of the series and does not finish as strong as it starts. Its watchable if your are not too picky and willing to just enjoy rather than look for production flaws.",7
representation,"Thank you for so much representation, on top of the main characters",10
Great Potential,Great potential if the two main characters would both get off screen for five minutes.Everyone else on the show has a seemingly more interesting story arch waiting to be told.,7
Season 2 was subpar,"It's like they switched out the entire Production team team from season one. The script was different, directing was different, acting was different, which mean casting was different, production was different. And not different as much as sucked, uninspiring and uninteresting. If not for having watched season one and loved it, I won't have bothered past ep 3 of season 2. As it is I missed at least one ep and several scenes from falling asleep but I have zero curiosity to go back and figure out what happened.The two new leads casted were just blah. I was quite disappointed bc I was rooting for them. Yet I don't blame them. I don't know if they weren't right for the roles and were mis-casted or they were right and misdirected. It was simply too obvious the problem
wasn't theirs. For example one of the new leads had a wig that clearly didn't fit her the entire show. They couldn't even get a decent wig or a hair stylist to make the wig look real? What a shame.There were some scenes that I'm sitting on my heels like wtf is happening, this is something at which a director should've yelled ""CUT"" and filmed until reasonable, such as when Kate fell from the horse. She was lying unmoving, presumably bc she was knocked unconscious, and not that she couldn't get up.If she was conscious, she would be moving, attempting get up. If she's physically unable to, the effort to get up would still persist but will appear as slight vague
movements. And her eyes would be open, Right?But she won't be moving at all if she was unconscious. Then someone tell me why but she had a grimace on her face as a reaction to the falling rain. An unconscious person conscious enough to KNOW it's raining. As the actor she won't know she was doing that, bc it's a reflex, something the body does without thinking. The director should've been the one to KNOW she was doing it and it doesn't fit into the scene then coached her to relax her face. Just one of many scenes that seemed to get worse over time.Oh the lines, we're straight up like blah, uninteresting and unbefitting of that period. You can just tell when then say line. It just won't land.Waste of time.",4
Brilliant! Addictive. You'll binge watch this in one day,Great casting. It's P&P meets Gossip Girl if the Bennett's were rich and had a baseball team of kids.I loved watching every minute of this and watched it in one sitting. The plot intrigues you immediately; episodes packed a lot of story in 1hr. It's another Shonda hit! Hope there's a season 2!!!,10
The hateration in this dancery!!!,"To all the people who are writing reviews based on the races and nationalities of the actors...you realize that this show is fiction, yeah?",9
Beautiful set and costume designs,"The costume and set designs were really beautiful. It's a perfect feel-good, easy-watch series to end the year with. Some plots were kinda predictable, but didn't make the show any less enjoyable. Living for the diversity of the cast and you could tell they had fun shooting this series.",
"Loved first season, dissapointed 2nd","I loved season 1. I watched it twice! But the second season was difficult to watch. Embarrassing. The first season was new, romantic and refreshing, but now it dreaded on and and on with drama on drama and miscommunication. It felt fake, I didn't believe the love between Kate and Anthony, everything felt fake. With this season I lost my love for the series, it was a short one apparently. A shame, I really loved season 1. Season 1: decor/ costumes 10, overall feeling 10, acting 7-8, storyline 8, originality 9, ending 9. Season 2: decor/ costumes 10, overall feeling 4, acting 6-7, storyline 5, originality 6, ending 6.",7
Delicious,Not my genre but enjoyed every minute of this show. I'm off to read the other books now. Sappy romantic passionate. As per usual the book readers are here with their pitchforks.,10
Frivolity in the Midst of World War,"As I recently watched the new Emma. I was struck that Jane Austen was writing in the midst of a terrible World War in which England was straining all its efforts (well, obviously these empty-headed twits weren't exerting any effort at all) to defeat Napoleon and his French legions. Hundreds of thousands were dying while these folks fretted about good matches and profitable marriages. In Braidgerton you see a few Court uniforms and one absent soldier is referenced, but this show looks much more like antebellum Versailles than a country just entering the Industrial Revolution. Pointless fun, not unlike Alicia Silverstone in ""Clueless."" Only here in the midst of COVID. Does this show make you forget all that? Did you even realize the historical connection? If you want empty calories and empty careless people, and Downton Abbey is too ""real world,"" enjoy.",6
Shondaland NAILED IT,"The show is amazing, and embodied the soul os the books and characters!
The casting was AMAZING, the soundtrack classic yet modern, the scenery delightful!",10
One time watch.,It's good drama romance emotional combination. One time watch drama with romance emotional... family dramatic condition.,7
Heads above ALL!!!,I have literally just finished the whole of the new Netflix TV show release called Bridgerton!! It is HEADS ABOVE ALL!Outstanding Season. Each episode stands on its own! Brilliant!My favourite Netflix show ever!!!,10
Wrong music,In episode 4 the Second Waltz is played by the musicians. This waltz was composed by Shostakovich in 1938!!!,6
The low rating are ridiculous.,"I read the reviews of the low ratings and the very thing the people are complaining about is what makes ""Bridgerton"" entertaining and refreshing. We have seen Downtown Abbey and The Tudors ten times over. OMG! I can't believe so many people just don't get it. I can't believe that so many people are so uptight. ""Bridgerton was not intended to be accurate with culture and diversity of people, etc., etc., etc,. It's TV. Y'all need to go PBS or the History channel if your looking an account of history.",10
If you are a fan of the books...,"You should be a fan of the series. Beautiful and so clever. I still don't love Daphne but that may because of Simon! :D Casting is perfection, the story is going in all the right places. Someone who is a true fan of the books will appreciate this series. It's gorgeous. Thank you creators for the bees. I'm just in awe!",10
Not watched it yet!,"I watched the trailer & was taken aback with black people being portrayed in the way they are. I understood it to be an historical drama, in the Downton Abbey style. Having read reviews I realise this is not the case, & I can now accept the casting. But it does bother me that reviewers of 'The Gilded Age' complained it was not historically accurate. Surely that is a double standard. It's fine to flaunt history in one programme & not another. Please understand, as I do, this is television, stories, not the History Channel. I will watch this & hope to enjoy the spectacle.",
Hmmm,"The music is so well done, the clothing, and the diversity of people. But I'm a little bored! Just get on with the love story and give us what we want. Maybe I'm just impatient, but that's the only reason I'm sticking it out until the end. Halfway through and I'm ready for the ending!",6
"Yes and more, please!!","I loved the whole of color and scandal that the Bridgerton series created!!! I loved the thoughtfulness that was shown in including a cast of multiple races!! After the positive novelty of a diverse cast seeped in, I fell into the world that was created!!
I can't wait until season 2!!! 😍",10
It's no Jane Austen...,"I love watching costume dramas and literary adaptations, especially at Christmas. The period in which this is set is my favourite, being a long-standing fan of Jane Austen, but this is very different. That said, I love the costumes and sets and the insight into Regency society.
I know a lot of people have issues with the casting of POC, and I know it isn't necessarily historically accurate but people need to get over themselves and just enjoy it for what it is. The Duke is as handsome a leading man as any other literary hero, and it shouldn't matter what colour his skin is.
I haven't read the books so I don't know how accurate it is but it's entertaining enough. As a friend and fellow costume drama fan put it: 'any costume drama is better than none at all'.",6
Whimsical,"Such an easy watch
The costumes are amazing
The acting is interesting in parts... Hastings is simply delightful",10
Enjoyable guilty pleasure,"This series seems like a mix of Gossip Girl, Downton Abbey and a little bit of Pride and Prejudice. It does however lack the production value of Downton Abbey and the Script of Pride and Prejudice. That being said, it is an enjoyable watch and binge worthy. The actors and actresses are decent enough and the story - if not new - rather compelling.
It started out more or less innocent and became rather hot later in the season, which I truly didn't expect but felt quite new to this genre which made it a nice surprise. The series is very 21st century like. So don't expect a story, characters, costumes and the society to be all that accurate. It seems they wanted to do a more fictional, new take on this era and if it isn't sold as an historically correct show, I see no problem in that.
All in all it is worth a watch if you're looking for a light romance series. Don't expect too much from it, then I think you'll find yourself enjoying this guilty pleasure series.",6
So flipping good,I didn't read the book nor do I enjoy period dramas but DAMN this was good!!! The chemistry between them is soo damn palpable. Also the costumes are so wonderful and I just love the casting. A wonderfully fun romance.,10
If you don't look for historical facts it is good,"Even though it is not based on the historical facts. I liked it. It is like an alternate universe. Everybody in the reviews gave bad rating because of that historical problem. We all can agree that it is not the best show ever but it is not worth of 1/10 rating too. I personally didn't liked it at first but after if you accept the fact the show is pretty good. I love shows and film do that era so it attracted me more. I liked the acting and the script was not perfect but bearable. If you don't have any motives to watch this show, I'll give you one: Regé Page. I liked this show very much and thanks to him it was even better.",7
Whoever adapted the books for Netflix is tragically devoid of any wit whatsoever.,"I was a fan of the novels. Julia Quinn is renowned for her quick-witted banter & her character - Lady Danbury - is an especially beloved old curmudgeon who infamously delivers the most rapier-like burns. Whoever adapted the books for Netflix is tragically devoid of any wit whatsoever. The writing is awful and so very unfaithful to the novels or even actual history that it is extremely difficult to immerse oneself in this travesty of a universe Shonda Rhimes has created. Terrible screenplay and woke-like revisions of history aside (I say this as a woman of color, FYI), some of the actors were absolutely dreadful. The amount of overacting we were subjected to by certain characters almost made it seem like they were playing caricatures of Quinn's originals. Abominable.",3
Best Netflix Series,"These reviews are mixed.... But I loved the show!As a viewer, you can really tell how much effort is put into the production (hair, makeup, costumes, etc), but there is much more than that.It is so interesting to watch a show that is so different from everything else on tv right now. The acting is amazing and the show captures what life could have been like with no racism.After binge watching both seasons, I can say this is one of my favourite netflix series.I will continue to watch this show for as long as they will renew it.",9
Sexy Fairytale,"Sorry Jason Momoa you just got demoted to number two hero fantasy guy and replaced by Rege-Jean Page. This series is perfectly cast! Unless Simon is actually in love with Daphne in real life this is some pretty good damn acting because when was the last time a man looked at you like that and made your heart skip a beat.Fairytales in our society are and always have been for girls and this is a grown up version for women. I personally liked that I got to see a lot more of Simon's body than Daphne's thank you Shonda appreciate you. I have no idea what Simon was licking off of that spoon, but...wait what was I talking about?Okay, I had to take a moment now I'm back for the review.I actually wanted to give this review eight stars but I had to counter all of those ridiculous one stars that are on this website. I took away two points for the quasi- rape scene because that was not cool. Daphne that was a big no no and no Bueno.However, the costumes and the sets are amazing. People can suspend their disbelief for all kinds of historically inaccurate drivel in all types of genres that warn they're based on inspired events. There's an interracial cast, so what? It's sumptuous, it's beautiful it's wonderful to watch and a good time! It's what movies are meant to be...entertaining!! it has nothing to do with the realities of 1813 only with the imagination of people in 2020 and that's a good thing. Everything in the world we have started in someone's imagination. And I personally want an all inclusive future...And a world where Aquaman and Simon are both married to me. Just kidding honey you know you're the only man for me - -when I'm awake 😊",10
Cliche story but with HOT cast!,"I'm not gonna lie, the storyline of Bridgerton is very predictable. About man who don't want to have a lover but end-up marrying a woman and madly in love with her. But I do enjoy myself watching this show. Beside the storyline, the historical theme of this show is pretty interesting. Some people said the costumes are historically mess but for me it's fancy though.The things that I love from this show: 1) The cast. They're hot! They choose the right actor for Simon Basset; 2) The relationship of Bridgerton family especially Benedict and Eloise. I'm a person who always put family first over everything, so I adore them so much. Even though Anthony is kinda annoying. 3) Their accents are beautiful.If you love easy-cheesy romance, I recommend you to watch this show. This show is not that bad.",7
Season 2,Season 2 was truly amazing. Chemistry between Kate and Anthony was bonkers!!!! The enemies to lovers trope was beautifully executed. Such an amazing season. So much better then the 1 thanks to Kate's & Anthony's actors.,10
"Embrassing, Cringe, Doesn't make sense",This series is just boring. And the storyline doesn't make sense.,6
Dream away,"To start: I did not read the books the story is based on. I read some disappointed reviewers. I can't say anything other than: I totally loved the series! The story is very interesting and keeps you wanting to see more. It reminds me of young adult genre, with a touch of ""gossip girl meets stiff english stories"" and that combination worked superb for me!
The way the characters are being unfolded, the costumes, the acting, the setting.I am so hoping for more seasons of this great story! Please Netflix!",10
Quite entertaining,"Although the essence of the book is there, there are some changes in the story as expected. and despite I don't say this often, thank god for those changes because otherwise It would have been a very dull tv show.If you like regent romances and you're looking for something light, not too serious and in a way funny to watch, just give it a go and you won't regret it!The only ""bad"" thing I have to say is, the show failed to capture the humor of the 3 older Bridgertons brothers. In the book, Anthony, Benedict and specially Colin are always teasing each other, their mother or sisters, they have a mixed sense of irony and humor that I didn't see in the series!",7
"Not a documentary, and thats great",I really support the choice for a more diverse cast. Fiction is a door another worlds that mind can create.I,10
Terrible but a guilty pleasure,"If you want a period drama like the Jane Austin adaptations, turn around and try again. This will not be it. It will be not be another BBC Pride and Prejudice. There is cleary confusion on what time period this is set in by the makers of this series.
Leaving all historical inaccuracies aside (and there are a fair few), this show comes with lots of bad but some good. The writing is relatively poor, it has its moments where it is ok, but sometimes it is very cringey. The acting isn't so bad, it has quite a few well known names in it so I'd expect the acting to be relatively decent. Although at times some of the acting is painful and cringey. The story is OK, however I feel it was extremely rushed. For example, the marriage should have been at the end of the series. The unveiling of Lady Whistedown was also very rushed. Speaking of which, I'd like to see how they explain this one because that seems highly implausible.
The good now. The acting is decent as mentioned. This has nothing to do with the show but the lead actress has such a beautiful face. The clothing, whilst sometimes inaccurate for the historical period I think they're aiming for, is most of the time quite beautiful.
And whilst it has all these flaws, it is binge worthy and has made me want to keep watching. You want to see where the story goes (although it is painfully obvious where the main story of Dalphne and the Duke is going). So if you want a guilty pleasure series and you won't get too upset about historical inaccuracies, then you'll enjoy this. Just don't watch it with your parents, you'll know why within the first 15-20 minutes of the first episode.",7
No redeeming features,"The entire thing is just so ill-conceived. No wonder Netflix is going down the tubes.I love fiction, I love creativity. But this fiction is actually so UNCREATIVE.Firstly, why re-use this historical period if you're going to walk all over it without thinking of any good reasons for it? Yes I'm talking about the wrong casting, music, costumes etc but please read on.It's as stupid as a World-War 2 movie where all the Nazis are Jewish and Australian women, or a Civil War drama where half the slaves are Asian and Norwegian. There's simply no good reason for this other than ""we wanted to hire these actors and don't care about any truths"".On top of this the entire story being about the top selfish 1% of society being totally obsessed about their inbred genetics (as they actually were) just makes it all even more stupid. It's not even a STORY worth amplifying in this day and age.Now if you DO start out wanting to hire diverse actors, which I applaud, then make up powerful new stories that respect all the cultures of earth and empower them. Choose scripts that are clever, funny, entertaining by all means, but let's ACTUALLY help people be better. Random hiring practices into crap stories are not the way.",1
"Love it, binge watched all!",I love everything about it. As far as live stories go it's got everything you need. Truly an easy watch!,10
Wonderful,Love this series. Im actually rationing the episodes to prolong the experience.,10
Surprisingly addicting,"As the year 2020 came to an end, Netflix released the first season a new series, ""Bridgerton"" that tackles the social issues of the unheard voices in its unique way.Bridgerton could easily be mistaken as a romantic comedy for family at first judging from the lighthearted tones and the style of story telling. However, it comes with many rated scenes and heavy dramas through out the show. The show takes place in Mayfair, London in the year 1813. With the cliche-driven plot, the story starts off by introducing the season of marriage where each family must present their daughters to the queen to be chosen as the ""Diamond of the First Water"". The Bridgerton, a family known for their good looking genes, also sends their daughter, Daphne Bridgerton. Undoubtedly, she gets chosen as the most flawless and wanted of the season. The town full of gossips that relies on the writing of Lady Whistledown, the anonymous writer that has the whole town shaken with each secret she reveals, has to fear her as she holds their faith in her hands, including Bridgerton's.The show can get you hooked in no time with the dramatic plot and fast paced story telling, but it's not for everyone. Many may find it cringe-worthy from its cliche plot and soapy drama, but it's worth a try. Another aspect of the show that is new to us is having a diverse cast with more people of colours being royalties unlike in other western period pieces. One of my favourite things about it is the music that is mixed between classical instrumental and modern days pop melodies. It gives the audience an experience of how hearing our favourite songs in the ball room would feel like. I would say it's definitely a binge-worthy show with only 7 episodes, ending with no extreme cliff-hanger and a good feeling of closure.",7
"Naysayers, get over yourselves!","I am currently on my 3rd viewing of the series. Yes, unlike many, I HAVE actually waited until watching the ENTIRE season before commenting. I am loving it!While I was initially unsure about the diversity, as a student of history & a lover of the Bridgerton books & historical romance as a genre, once the explanation was included into the story I found that it became irrelevant. People, please remember this is an ADAPTION of a fictional story, it is NOT, and does not claim to be, an attempt at an historically accurate documentary about Regency English nobility & gentry social interactions.One thing that it grating terribly for me is the insistence of some commenters on classifying the servant roles as slaves. Even in the 'holy land' (no, I am not American, yes, that was sarcasm) of the United States, slaves were not everywhere & were not the only people serving in households.Please Netflix continue through the entire series of books, I look forward to many more seasons of Bridgerton viewing!",10
Entertaining but pointless,The dresses and the surroundings in general are very interesting. It takes you to another century. The story is entertaining but I felt like there was missing something. When I finished it seemed a bit pointless. And the last sequence when Daphne gave birth to her child is absolutely out of context. They skipped to much. That was a bit sad.,6
Loved it,"Ohhhh I loved the show and I hope it will be season 2!
Well done all actors!!! The costumens and performance was great! I enjoy every minut of the show.
Easy to watch and understand, no killing people, war and all that...
thank you Shonda !
Greetings from Sweden",10
For those who love cheesy rom coms,"Honestly i don't understand all the bad reviews. I binge watched this series and found it very easy to watch. Yes it is cheesy and cliche but that's what makes it good. If you're looking for depth, reality and meaning this isn't for you. After watching this i am looking forward to reading the books. I loved the costumes, setting and music. The only thing i found unnecessary probably was how horny Simon and Daphne were all the time.",7
Very enjoyable,"I enjoyed everything: the script (I was reading the book at the same time), the acting, the costumes, the acting, the music, the decor. I don't understand the bad reviews. I have family and friends watching and loving it.
I must admit I am re watching some episodes again. Starting book 2 and looking forward for season 2.",9
Awful,Watched all of it to see what the fuss was about. Would not recommend to anyone.,6
Dandy dreadlocks,"I was able to cope with the ethnic angle of characters, but the directing is terrible, for example, the cardboard promenade scenes by the river are filmed as though the director has just shouted, ""and action!"" there is some awful acting and truly the worst editing I've ever seen.",2
Phenomenal,"I was hooked within the first 5 minutes. This show is the epitome of slow burn romance. But with so many character arcs and portrayals within. It is clear the main focus is of Daphne and Simon but the side plots of Eloise's search for Whistledown, Anthony's affair with Siena, the whole debacle with Marina's pregnancy, etc... There is so much going on but it is all orchestrated in a eye catching way. I binge watched the whole season in a night but then further watched it to just fully bask in how wonderful it is. I made an account just to state how highly I think of the show. The one and only fault I found was the dressing for the era it is staged. But I am not a history buff therefore it was a minimal effect to me.LOVED LOVED LOVED it. Waiting on season two.",9
STUNNING,"Beautiful actors, gorgeous imagery... and can we talk about the costumes? Such attention to detail was paid in all areas.
Truly enjoyable to watch--every second of it.",10
surreal ?,"If you are a hard line period drama expert then I would not expect you to like this series at all, you will most likely pick out the timeline mistakes rather than enjoy the acting and period costume.If you are open minded and hoping to be entertained then look no further, the storylines are great, from Daphne and Simon, to Anthony and the Sharma sisters, with the excellent Pen and Eloise in between.Its funny but it has its serious moments, having watched "" Bank of Dave"" before this series, I could not believe that Phoebe Dynevor who played "" Alexandra"" in this movie was the same actress who plays "" Daphne"" she was superb in her character.The surreal was "" Material Girl"" being played at the ball, and Penelope played by Nicola Coughlan who will always be familiar has Clare from Derry girls, speaking in an english accent of which you get so use to, so much so, when she disguises her voice with an Irish accent you tend to forget it is her normal voice.Overall its a worth the watch, but with a lot of out of timeline situations, even to the point they might has well shown vapour trails from aircraft in the sky and you would not think any more less of the series. Because the acting great, I get the idea that this is a 21st century drama set in the 17-1800's ? Does it come across as that ?",6
"Beautiful, sexy romance!","A sumptuous and romantic adaptation of the first book in one of the best regency romance series of all time. The cast are beautiful and engaging and the story top notch with a swoon worthy happily ever after for the ages! Can I get season two now, please?",10
Season 2 is not as good,Season 2 left main characters Daphne and Simon out of the story. Although I appreciate other character development it could have been written better. Season 2 was quite a disappointment.,7
Fiction came to life,"I've been a fan of JQ's earlier work and the first 4 books of the Bridgerton series. I can not remember how many times I've read this series and know their stories by heart. I admit that I was one of the fans who were skeptical with the cast not being faithful to the book when I first got wind of the casting choices. I mean, where's Simon's piercing blue eyes? Why are the Bridgerton men's heights wrong or Daphne's hair colour is different than the rest. But whilst I was watching this, I forgot all those and embraced the characters with arms wide open. This is a work of fiction and people can do well by treating it as such. It is lavish, it is fun. There's drama and intrigue. Yes, they have changed the story a bit to fit a TV series but I have learned long before that books and movies are going to be different. I am giving it a 9 just because I'm still undecided if I like how they depicted one of my favourite characters. I can't wait for Anthony and Kate's story as that is my favourite book in the series! Bee it is!",9
"Decent, but...","First of all, I must admit that if it had not been for the recommendation of a friend, I wouldn't have been aware of this series' existence. At the end and after observing it for the last four days, I can conclude that ""Bridgerton"" is not bad nor good as some people say. In other words, I found it completely decent for my taste.It is a series that, despite having a good plot, good tension and humorous moments, excellent characters, good cinematography; and a dynamic, interesting score that combines musical pieces of the time and some conversions of the present, stands out more for some of its shortcomings than for its virtues. To be more specific, Season 1's biggest problem was that the plot development felt somewhat unstable, since although there were moments where the story was interesting, there were others that seemed so cringey (especially the sex scenes) and boring that I had to momentarily stop watching.Another issue that plagued Season 1 considerably was in the chemistry and relationship factors between the characters, since it was noted that between the main themselves and some recurring ones these factors suffered and lagged at times. As a consequence, I had some problems connecting with some of them. Fortunately, the aforementioned issues were able to settle firmly in the last two episodes (albeit too little, too late).And last but not least, the series has several historical inaccuracies regarding Britain's Regency era due to today's Politically Correct social agenda. Therefore, my advice towards potential viewers that closely follow 19th Century history is to proceed with caution and not set too much expectations from this part. If not possible, please refrain from watching it.As I previously said, ""Bridgerton"" is an average series, but also one that suffers a lot of mind-blowing overhype. Therefore, it would need some major improvements for Season 2 in order to solve that problem. Regarding myself, I could look forward for the aforementioned Season 2...But given the fact that Season 1 left me with a somewhat bittersweet experience, that remains to be seen.",6
Amazing,"Loved the show, the cast was perfect, the story addicting, I can't wait for season 2",10
Keeps you hooked,"Bridgerton is one of those shows which keeps you hooked to the screen till the end. I thought I would stop after watching one episode and watch the next after a week and so on. But, as I started watching, I couldn't stop and had to go to bed late than usual to finish the show. Last 4 episodes, will keep you anticipating, waiting and excited. Markers of the show is very successful in keeping one indulged in their work. Kudos to the team.",7
Just silly,"There is plenty material that is perfect for colorblind casting. This is not one of them.The production is beautiful and so are the actors, but meh!It just more idiotic writing and essentially a huge bowl of nothing.",4
New Historical series,"I started watching this series and I must say that I really enjoyed it! This series is fun to watch, especially if you like Gossip Girl. The costumes are well chosen and the characters are fun to watch as well. It is not an accurate representation of the 18th century.
However, it is a series, which is why it does not have to be. Diversity in a series is good! In my opinion, netflix did a very good job with the cast and the entire series.",9
"Never written a review before, but I gotta say I really misjudged this tv show before even watching it fully","I have never read the books (I intend to), and I heard about all of this hype about Bridgerton when it came out. I tried to watch the first episode with my boyfriend but we didn't really give it a chance and just judged it (also because I've seen a lot of bad reviews). Now after we gave it a chance again and are now by the end of season 2 I have completely fallen in love with this show. It has everything about romance I adore. Thought season two wouldn't match the romance of season 1, but just wow I love it so much. Even my boyfriend loved it. I hope the next seasons are gonna give us good storylines and romance like the past two seasons!",10
What !,"First thing I saw was that the two most 'reprehensible' characters were both black . A young woman who was pregnant but ' unwed ', in those days unforgivable and the the Duke's vile abusive father. A slip-up in the casting ? What ? Diversity is great but it needs vigilance. I would be interested to know if any white people noticed this, my white friends think I am being oversensitive about what is essentially a piece of fun fluff.",
Had potential,"I was interested at first, but I guess I just don't think there's any chemistry between the main two characters.... it started to get boring and ridiculous at the same time.... like the things standing in the way of happiness were so stupid and contrived.",7
Not what I expected!,I initially thought this would be just another boring period drama but I was so wrong! I absolutely did not expect to like this but I loved it! I thought the narration was great!,10
Changed my perception!,I never really liked black actors or watched their movies .. but now I have become a fan.. media is such a powerful thing to change whatever racial bigotry is happening around the world..,7
Dear readers...,"My goodness, so many people complaining about historical accuracy and ""colour washing"". This piece is fantasy, it is not intended to be entirely factual, if you are looking for that there are many more tv shows and movies that will suit you.Secondly, inclusion is not colour washing. Personally I loved this shake up in regency style drama and I applaud the show for making this choice. Not only does it change the formula for this style of tv show but it allows young women and men to see themselves in this context of being desirable, which I believe can only be beneficial.I believe this show is yet to find its balance of sex scenes, season 1 was soft porn while season 2 was wholly without so much of a kiss.",8
Just Take it for What it is,"Once you get past episode 4, it gets interesting. I was told episode 3 but that episode had me falling asleep as well. I think it's important to realize this is a fantasy, I don't think it ever said it's a historical non fiction drama, it's historical FICTION. Don't get me wrong, the ""color blind"" casting rubbed me the wrong way at first, but putting those nuisances aside I was able to enjoy the show better. Let me be clear, I'm a Latin American woman so the ""color blind"" casting bothered me in the sense that it came off as patronizing. I'm aware Blacks were free in England long before they were in the US, but they were still discriminated by the likes of families like The Bridgertons or Featheringtons. Personally, I don't think forcing people of color into narratives where they just weren't accepted, even if it is only fantasy does no one any favors. I rather see stories that have yet to be told about people of color be given the Netflix treatment, there's plenty, no point in adding them to a White story, and that's my 2 cents on that.In terms of the story, it's typical for the modern day teen dramas. However, I wasn't that interested in the main protagonist's storyline as much as I was in The Featherington's, particularly Penelope, cousin Marina, and one of The Bridgerton boys. Their story to me was much more interesting and worth coming back to, I think it's what kept me watching. Also wanting to discover who Lady Whistledown is kept me around. Other than that, you've got yourself an MTV seal of approval type of show. I never watched ""Gossip Girl"" but I can imagine what it was like given all the shows that came out around that time period. It's like a mix of Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette and any teen drama on MTV or abc Family from the early to mid 2000's. There's nothing really earth shattering about it, it just had the right formula to get it to the top spot.In terms of acting, everyone does a great job with their roles, I can't think of anyone that did poorly. The Duke and Daphne's actors are fantastic, I just couldn't get into their story. The Duke, though, delivers. He's a complicated character but he plays it in such a subtle way so he's not the stereotypical brooding, playboy character. Daphne is not over exaggerated like most main female protagonists are in these period dramas, the actress plays her in a realistic, natural way. This is why these two have great chemistry in the show because they're not being ridiculous or over acting.All in all, I found it alright and will definitely be tuning in for season 2. As my title says just take it for what it is. Let it transport you to it's world of fantasy and enjoy it.",7
Must watch!,"Very captivating! I'm quite enjoying this series! Great acting, great story lines. Definitely worth watching!",10
Pure irony,"The series itself is alright. It had allot of potential but besides the cringeworthy genderroles. While black people around that time existed. It seems like allot of people are offended by the fact that a European historical movie contains black people in a positive position. While that actually existed, there is enough proof just do your research instead of calling it inaccurate.Ironically, the same people offended would care less if Cleopatra was played by a white blue-eyed woman in the middle of africa BC. Or all the other movies where main characters of colour replaced by white actors with allot of make-up. Pure irony. And I'm loving it. Lets change the narrative. Its powerful. If you are offended because you actually think Europeans should be superior in any time of history, you are a part of the problem dear.",6
How can anyone think it is good???,"Could barely watch the end of episode 1.....
a bad soap opera trying to make a 19th century love story modern...omg this is so ridiculous my eyes are still bleeding! If you like it it you need to explain why coz I really don't get it!",1
"Delicious, delightful and Decadent","Quirky, cute and quaint. I could come up with many more adjectives to describe this darling show. Oh, I forgot lovely. LOL! This show could not have come along a more perfect time. During covid we needed to smile, I mean a really big smile, and Bridgestone delivers. I haven't felt this good watching a show in along time. It isn't as funny as the book ""The Duke and I"" but it is makes for it by being so totally cute. The storyline is sometimes a bit foolish, but who cares it is so much fun to watch. I don't think the lead actors are well matched. But I liked them very much. And they do have chemistry. The actress playing Daphne looks like Peter Pan's sister for the Disney movie. Cute as a button. I don't know what is going on this year, but she is the second actress to look like a Disney cartoon character, the other is the lead actress in The Queen's Gambit. I can't wait for Season 2 and read the rest of Julia Quinn's books.",10
Good Fun,"I've not read the books so don't know how faithful it is but this series was great fun. It was over the top and very dramatic but also very funny. Which is exactly what you want from a Regency era comic-drama.It's exactly the sort of thing to take your mind off real life drama. It is definitely a good idea to spend 8 hours watching people dancing in beautiful clothes atextravagant balls, and wondering if the pretty young woman will marry the handsome Duke. (Instead of worrying about a pandemic) I definitely recommend.But to those complaining about ""forced diversity"" and ""wokeness"" of the series: get a grip.If this were a biopic or a retelling of a real moment in history then I would be as picky as anyone else about historical accuracy (although I do think some real life figures whose skin colour is not particularly important to their story, so it doesn't always matter). But this is a fictional programme. I assume all the people complaining that there shouldn't be black people playing aristocrats are also annoyed at the use of modern pop songs and modern phrases? No? Right, well it's just racism then.Do not try to disguise your racism by pretending that you care about historical accuracy when really you just don't like that you're seeing black people on the telly.Well the cast are all excellent and are in those roles because they are brilliant. And they're not going anywhere. So get used to it.And just watch it because it's wonderful, good fun!",8
I can only review Title because that's all I saw.,"Bridgerton had better not be a real place because I want to say it sounds made up. Netflix's period shows all look like junk just based on the hair and make up of the actresses. I know the scripts will be some form of Young and the Restless pablum. Whom are these shows for? Certainly not the folks who watched British series imported for Masterpiece theater with Alistair Cook (not the watered down, dumbed down version today on Sunday nights. I guess they're for teens? I miss period shows for smarter audiences. PHones and TVs and cars got smarter. Period series though. Go watch some series from the 70s or 80s. Probably sentences and scenes are too long.",
Easy comedy,"This is not historical I guess, it's just a light politically correct show, nevertheless I enjoy it, I usually watch it when I do my nails just to have something in the background. I am not impressed by the acting or costumes or anything else.",6
Brilliant,Loved this show so much. Great to see a diverse cast executing the script with wit and brilliant acting. Highly recommended. Those complaining about the cast's diversity are showing how racist the world still is. Sad.,10
Cute but repetitive,"This is a really sweet and funny series but after a while you get kind of bored. There are no new intrigues, just the same one happening to other people. Also, very few characters show any kind of depth.
This is a light watch, for sure. Just don't expect any kind of grandeur like ""Pride and prejudice"" or ""Emma"". Jane Austen it is not.",6
Good series,"I don't understand why this series has got the 1-star review. I like it. Firstly, yhr plot seems quite simple, but it's not disadvantage of it. It shows the life and emotions of young men and women. You can experience the same emotions. Secondly, the cast is great. Thirdly, the atmosphere and setting are great, I really love costume design.
So, it's good romance series.",8
Little bit cliché but still nice,"For those who STILL haven't seen this series but LOVES romance here's a MUST that should go to the top of your list! Super romantic and somewhat cliché, it is still great entertainment! #serieslovers #netflix #bridgerton",7
I don't understand all the hate,"This is a beautiful fantasy and a great romance. It was a little disconcerting at first to see all of the diversity, but it wasn't long before I could just enjoy it for what it was. Rege-Jean Page is a dream boat and I couldn't get enough of him. I went back and watched Roots and For The People just so I could see more of him. I wasn't disappointed. I also watched SNL when he was the host. I can't wait for The Gray Man and D & D to come out.",10
Ignore Those Whining About PC Revisionism,"Enjoyable romp with plenty of romance. Looks great.And those complaining about the diverse casting are showing their utter ignorance. During the period this drama is set, England had a Black queen. The country's second Black queen. Erasure of Black faces from historical drama is at an end. Get over it.",7
Not nearly as brilliant as the books,"So, I really loved the book series. I've re-read them over and over and was delighted at the thought of the series. And sure, it's entirely watchable but it's just such a disappointment.Julia Quinns characters are multifaceted, witty and generally very likable. In Shondaland's version, the plots are much more elaborate but the character building is just lacking.I can't help but thinking that the show's creators have spent too much time thinking about the visuals and forgotten that the key to any good story us good story telling.Also, I'm highly confused by the mixed race setup. There are two ways of doing this. Option 1 is to disregard physical likeness and cast actors with different skin colour as british aristocrats without commenting further. After all, the point of acting is to play someone who's different from yourself.Shondaland has gone with the second option, to try to create an alternate reality in which people of colour would indeed be Brittish aristocrats. To do this require a credible historical background. Here, Shondaland just vaguely suggests that the king liked a black woman and the next you knew, the court was swamped with black people in wiggs. This doesn't make sense. If this happened, why is there absolutely no cultural fusion, no inspirations in fashion and clothes? The entire topic is just so sloppily handled.Julia Quinns strength is credibility that stems from that she's so well researched. When she adds a female doctor i one of her series, she makes sure that the doctor only uses technologies available at the time and studied at one of the very few schools available for females at that time.In this version, the detailing is just very sloppy. If you don't bother to learn anything about 1810, then don't set your series in 1810. An example is when queen Charlotte makes a request about a special license. Anthony answers that that won't be needed as he intends to get married in his home... i.e. Exactly the kind of situation (i.e. Outside of church) that would indeed require a special license. This might seem obscure if it wasn't for the fact that Julia Quinn dedicated a full post-script section to explain how special licences work. Is this super important? Of course not but when dealing with historical drama, accurate details is what makes stories credible.",3
AMAZING,"I completely binge watched Bridgerton! You can in love with the characters, the families and just want to know what is going to happen with them. I wish there was already season 2. It's a must watch. It reminded me of a Gossip Girl in the 1800' s.",10
Very Entertaining!,"I very much enjoyed watching this show. So much that I watched all episodes in one day. I'm not a huge fan of anything historical in period but this was extremely enjoyable. I love the art having studied art at university, the grand rooms with the paintings were fun to see. The story was also compelling. I wish there would be a second season.",9
Just enjoy it as an entertainment,"I have no issue with the diverse cast, it shouldn't make a difference to story telling unless the piece is heralded as historically accurate in every way. Because of that I also don't care that the costumes are at times, beautifully elegant and then in other scenes look like an explosion in Laura Ashley! Again, that's not why I give it a mediocre score. I watched four episodes back to back and just could not really describe four hours of story. I felt that just nothing really happened. It felt a bit repetitive rather than a sharp game of wits played by the two lead characters. This is of course my review and my opinion.
I find comments such as ""check your privilege"" to be quite offensive to the people who wrote in here. This is a movie review by normal movie watchers. Does being a hard working, reasonably successful white woman preclude any opinion that allows freedom of expression? Lest you be judged as a racist!! This is where inclusivity and changing the norm may fail as opinion and thoughts are judged and repressed.
I didn't give a rats fig that three of the main characters were privileged black characters including Queen Charlotte! I only thought about it when I read a comment on Facebook. Am I surprised given some of the rhetoric that black actors would be involved in a project about the privilege of riches on the back of slavery? Oh no. That's right, I actually don't care because actors are adults and can make their own choices on who to portray and of that portrayal fuels the legacy of that period. Bravo to everyone I say. It's entertainment.",6
Pride & Prejudice meets fifty shades,What a fab and refreshing show I was hooked straight awayWhat a fun and fresh take on period dramasCan't wait for the next series,10
Let's raise some money...,"...to help the producers and replace aaaaall the plastic flowers from gardens, woods, walls, and poor vases.😆
So ridiculous to see people smelling fake flowers; those unnatural colours are hurting my eyes and senses.Poor wind and poor bees.",6
Pretty reasonable fare.,My only complaint is the contortionist that performed for Queen Charlotte in one scene was wearing stiletto heels which weren't invented until about 1950!,8
"Shallow, entertaining,fun.","A lot of reviewers on here have their panties tied over the fact that Bridgerton, a self-proclaimed interpretive fantasy, is not historically accurate. The anachronism is kind of the whole point of the show. Still I'll say it -- Dickinson did it better, because it embraced it wholeheartedly, and didn't shrink back in bringing a modern perspective to the characters, whereas Bridgerton seems at times to waver. Still it's a fun watch, and the costumes and sets are dazzling.",6
Perfect!! It is NOT a historical tale!,"Good romance and good plot! I did read de books and the alterations are fine, didn't bothered me at all. About the black actors playing aristocracy in 1813, IT IS A FICTION! welcome to tv. Open your minds please. Really worth watching!!!!!!!",10
Cute but overrated,"Totally overrated but still cute and fun. I was more interested in some of the other family members' side stories than I was in the two main romantic leads. Daphne's character was so sweet and proper that I found her a bit boring. The Duke was handsome but also felt a little bland. I also don't understand all the buzz about how ""hot"" the sex scenes were. They felt pretty vanilla overall and at times unintentionally comical.The first half of the season had WAY more momentum than the second half, at which point it started to amble about with drama that felt really artificial no matter how hard the writers and actors tried to invent ""conflict.""Some of the side stories with the ""less perfect"" characters that seem to be developed for later seasons show promise though, so I'll probably check out season 2.",6
Please stop this nonsense.,"This is just unbelievable how modern tv applies rules which defy reality. This tv series is closer to phantasy books than to the productions showing the historic reality. Well if people buy lies colourfully packed, this tv series is full of that.",1
Can't wait for the season two,I loved so much this show. The picture is perfect. The cast is fabulous and so talented. I took a star because that specific polemic scene between Daphne and the duke. It was unnecessary and totally wrong. It was romanticized and we know it.,9
What happened to the necklace?,"The prince gives Daphne an extravagant jeweled necklace, which she wears to the ball where the prince is expected to propose (episode 4?). Before he can pop the question, Daphne runs outside. She rips off the necklace and places it on the garden wall.A new scandal? Someone finds the necklace and reports back to the queen? Blackmails Daphne to get it back? Absconds with it and Daphne is desperate to find it to return it to her rejected suitor? Nope. None of the above. It just disappears and is never mentioned again.",8
Brainless entertainment,"It's pretty to look at. That's about it.No but seriously, it's not terrible. It's just not the sort of thing to take too seriously. It's a bit of fun, the gossip girl of period dramas.And I'm definitely going to watch season 2.",6
LOVED this show.,"What is wrong with all these bad reviews. This show was not written to be fiction. this series is a binge worthy show, a lot like gossip girl. Really hope it continues as people are extremely too hard on shows these days and it ruins it for everyone who enjoys it.",10
Ordinary and plane fairy-tale,"Just an handsome lad cast and an Okay Romance story. Nothing special, only ladies hype...",7
I loved it,"I was very excited to watch the series. The cast is amazing, I love all the actors. I think they could have eliminated a certain scene, but the rest of the series, I found it exciting. The main character, Daphne, had everything to be one of the best sisters, but ...",10
Has its Ups and Downs,"I will say this first: I did enjoy both seasons and will be watching when the new seasons come out. That being said, I found a few things of redundancy that were quite annoying at times...
The fact that everyone including the queen were so caught up with what the gossip paper said was a bit over the top. And hearing it narrated/read EVERY SINGLE EPISODE started really being annoying after half of season 1 for me.The other bit that was a bit much was the ""almost kiss"" like 8xs in season 2.Honestly, the fact that the Duke is NOT IN SEASON 2 (or apparently ever again) was/is completely lame. Even if the actor had other things going on, there were definite scenes/functions going on where it completely made no sense that he wasn't there. I mean season 2 is all about the Duke's best friend getting matched! And the constant peptalks coming from the Dutchess and not the Duke about relationships was just lame. I mean at the least, he absolutely should have been at the wedding!!! She made comments like ""I had to leave my child and husband to come here...""
It was the perfect story line for the Duke to talk through and help his friend...Lastly, I will say this regarding the new season getting ready to start 2024...I seriously wish it wasn't Penelope Featherington's love story. I find her character to be the most annoying of the entire show! Colin could definitely do better. I understand being childhood friends, but the show's title is Bridgerton and her character is just too much of everything. One ""romantic match"" that really shouldn't be. It would be fantastic if they didn't end up together. And being that Mama Bridgerton's life is supposed to be the example of Love, she 100% deserves to find love again!! That's a love bloom story worth telling!!",7
Brits need to review their history,"I'm not sure why Brits are so angry about a fiction tv show from a fictional novel shows interracial partners. Queen Victoria received an African child as a gift and provided for her and her daughter the remainder of their lives. Capt John Smith married Pocahontas. The current royals are of German descent, not English.I'm guessing the angry bigotry caused Harry and Megan to leave. Their are records of interracial marriages in England dating back to the 1500""s. Get over it. As far as Americans telling a British story, Christian Bale can play Batman, Dick Cheney and Laurie, then an American Can direct a ""British"" series. Who else could have played Bridget Jones for heavens sake.If that is what causes you to dislike a story, then don't watch it. I thought this was pretty well done. It's intriguing and far less boring than Downton Abby. The story stays pretty close to the books. I hope there is a second season, but it was pretty much tied up at the end. I adored Simon and thought he did a great job. Wigs were a thing in 1817 Britain. I swear Paul Hollywood must have done the food. Hand pies and lady fingers and trefoils, oh my!
Enjoy a glass of tea and some biscuits and enjoy a good story.",9
Gossip girl,"All one needs to imagine is Gossip girl in the eighteen-hundreds with the scandals and problems of the time period. A lot of the characters manage to stay quite distant, dispite good enough performances. The sex between the main couple is really emphasized. It got a bit boring. The problems and solutions were very simple. The season was ok. Those who enjoy silly romance dramas will love this. I say meh.",6
20 minutes was all I could take,"I usually like these kind of period productions, but this was an awful mess. Just silly and not entertaining. I wanted to like it. But no.",2
Great show about a great book,"The series managed to tell the story beautifully by inserting issues of diversity and important themes without changing the essence of what is told in the books. The changes that appeared served to add drama and as a connection for the next seasons. I loved the cast, the scenery and the costumes. The soundtrack with current songs played by the Vitamin String Quartet is a bonus. Great entertainment. Looking forward to the second season.",9
Easy and fun watch,This is an easy and enjoyable watch. I love period pieces and really liked the updated spin. A lot of the negative reviews mention how this isn't an accurate portrayal and all I can say is if you didn't like Hamilton the musical then you probably won't like this show. Take it for what it is: a 21st century spin on 19th century England,9
season one and two,"Bridgerton is a classic Regency era costume drama.Season One had more fireworks on the romance side
Season Two less fireworks with a single story line.I have watched plenty of these drama's going all the way back to Claudius on PBS.They all vary in quality depending on their creators.Bridgerton is likeable, middle of the road drama.Not the top and not the bottom of the pack.I in particular enjoy lady Whistle down, poking fun at the Aristocratic class.",6
I was recommended to watch only season 2 and loved every bit of it,"I watched season 2 in speed 1.5 like I always do in the Netflix app and I was recommended to watch season 2 instead of season 1 as I heard season 1 was cringy and they needed a lot of sex to make it a hit. Now I can tell you I loved season 2, the eye stares, the characters that were explored and the chemistry of the lead actors was through the roof. Now people that hesitate to watch Bridgertom season 2, go watch it you won't regret it.",8
Better than I was lead to believe from the reviews but not brilliant.,"I'm going to say it first to get it out of the way but I don't think for one second this show would be as popular if it weren't for Regé-Jean Page.It's going to be interesting to see if viewer numbers drop now he's not returning for another series.He's beautiful, he's tall and elegant and he's the perfect period drama lead male. But I also had a feeling he was internally cringing while saying some of the lines.I've never read the books, I don't know how much they changed the story and I also don't know how much I am missing because I haven't read the books, but I felt everything was a little rushed and far too many characters squeezed in.I'm really sorry, I am sure she's a lovely lady but Phoebe Dynevor was boring. It may be the way the character is written, I've never seen her in anything else, but there was just no personality to her. It's really hard to care for a character who is this dull.The relationship with the Duke was ridiculous. How are we supposed to believe that a couple of lingering looks equates to the kind of love someone would duel for. They were married, then we had an episode of continuous and very cringeworthy sex, then they fall out and the marriage is supposed to be over. I may have slept at some point and not realised it but it seemed as if we'd jumped an episode.I was far more interested in the outer characters. I really wanted the King and Queen's relationship explored more, it seems to be far more interesting than the lead characters.Polly Walker as always is amazing. I really loved Nicola Coughlan and Claudia Jessie too.The characters of the brothers and their respective women seemed to be setting up for better storylines too.I am led to believe that each different book follows a different sibling and I am hoping the next story will be more interesting and written at a better pace.Is it historically accurate? Nope. It doesn't pretend to be, nothing is presented as fact. The costumes are gorgeous, again not always accurate but who really cares in a fictional production? I don't listen to mainstream music so I had no idea they played modern songs at the balls until I read some reviews so that didn't bother me either.It was watchable and I didn't hate it, but the dialogue was tacky and I hope that improves for the next series.",6
Fun to watch,"If you're looking for an historically accurate depiction of Regency London with all the Austen flair you can handle, move along; this show isn't for you. However, if you know the series is based on Julia Qinn's best-selling series, and you know that she is romance writer - a rather steamy one, I may add - then stick around. The makers of this show were going for fun and spicy. The multitude of anachronisms (music, colors, ethnically diverse characters, etc.) display the playfulness of the show. It's not meant for stuffy and uptight viewers. It is meant for viewers who enjoy a little spice in their streaming time without outright raunch. So grab some ice cream, a glass of wine, and sit back to enjoy!",8
Ludicrous central mystery,"When you learn the reason behind the lead male character's failings, you'll wish you had stopped watching after around the fourth episode. A few interesting characters, but mostly superficial ones, not developed. Gratuitous overextended sex scenes did little to further the story. The music was either out of place or out of the appropriate time period. Trying to turn this period-piece soap opera into a morality story by the end is ultimately not successful, and the husband's behavior is laughable, be it by early English standards or ours.",7
Updated - Season 2 Close to Loving it,I enjoyed the second season more than I thought I would. It had a good slow burn romance and it focused more on small intimate moments and exchanges of their personal struggles than on simple sexual encounters like the previous season. The outfits and decor settings were beautiful as always and I really enjoyed every episode.,8
Great deep explication On what Jane Austen kept under her skirt,Modern life ideas on period dramas! Not bad i must say. But whats the point? Made in C /only way is Essex vs women's rights? We are not getting out of the wigs here are we?,6
Season 2 Review,So different from the books and impressively just as good. Amazingly awesome acting from both Jonathan Bailey and Simone Ashley and the other cast as well. The only thing I regret is not seeing more of them!,9
"Love, love, love, this show!!!","Wow, I cannot believe the venom in some of these reviews. Apparently someone touched a nerve. Why is it that people feel the necessity to tear everything down. Entertainment is entertainment... that is what it's for. If you like something watch it. If you don't, turn it off. I loved it because I got to fantasize, and if it is not historically correct who cares? I just needed something really good to take me away from Covid-19, and being quarantined in my home with only my dogs to talk to (thank goodness I have them) for the last 12 months. When I watch television I don't want to always watch things that are literally true. I got enough of that from the last 4 years of politics. I want to watch something that makes me feel good, makes me laugh sometimes, makes me feel, and yes - - makes me ""swoon"". I want to escape even if for just a little while. And I want to think that the world could be different, could be better, could experience change (just maybe a bit faster). Or perhaps there are alternate worlds. Besides all that I just plain loved this show.",10
"Beautiful costumes, but a story more politically correct that it pretends to be","Have you ever dreamed to see the brightest balls of the British aristocraty in the early 19th century ? To observe the ruses and the dirty tricks of scheming mothers to marry off their noble offspring? If so, Bridgerton is for you !London, during the Regency (1811-1820). Despite King George's mental illness, for the aristocracy, it's business as usual, and the wedding season is one of the highlights of the year. Matchmaking can ensure a family's fortune or its demise. Centuries of heritage and patrimony can be secured or wiped out. It's a matter of the utmost importance. For the Bridgerton's family, and for their neighbours the Featherington's family, daughters are to become debutantes. Daphne Bridgerton is smart and a flawless beauty, but her oldest brother, after their father's death, is overprotective and scares off all suitors, making his sister look undesirable. The unfortunate young girl is cruelly mocked by Lady Whistledown, the anonymous author of a scandalous society newsletter. But Daphne doesn't give up, and forms an alliance with the most eligible bachelor, the Duke of Hastings.Although smart and cynical, Bridgerton is still a show about romance, love that nothing can stand in the way of. It is also about the frivolous life of an idle aristocracy. Scandals can easily destroy lifes, but they also entertain ""the ton"". Those who are spared camouflage their relief by harshly judging those who have been singled out, rightly or wrongly. Whether the mysterious Lady Whistledown is a whistle-blower, a woman determined to change mores, or a cynical, disillusioned and frustrated spirit, it's hard to say. Probably all of those.More classical than it pretends to be, the show is especially noteworthy for its beautiful costumes and colourful sets ! Dresses, jewelry, salons and balls are all worth a look. The story is pleasant, if sometimes simplistic and even naïve. Some of the characters are endearing. But it's the visually idealized depiction of the aristocracy that really catches the eye.",6
Best show!,Please give us all 9 books! I'm currently watching season 1 for the second time!,10
"Quite magical and compelling, until it wasn't","I found this show so magical, rich, and interesting, until the characters married and moved away. I think that should have been the end of the season. The momentum of the will they or won't they was amazing and every note was pitch perfect. The final episodes had none of that and I think I'm done with the show for that reason. The rich diversity, btw, isn't a problem. It's what makes the show feel so fresh and different from the start and the show floats on its leads' sheer charisma, especially at the end, so the casting is a huge plus.I don't blame the showrunners. They followed the books. So we are where we are. But I did lose interest in and even affection for several characters by the time the season was over.",7
BEST ROMANTIC SERIES OF ALL TIME!,I read the book about 8 years ago and it was true to the setting and mood!! I absolutely fell in love with the SIMON AND DAPHNE. The music and songs in this series are also beautiful as is the chemistry between our main couple. I recommend this series to everyone.,10
There's good and bad to it... at least they TRIED to explain the racial integration,"Side note on the racial aspect: I also just finished the latest Anne Boleyn adaptation where Anne was black. THAT made no sense: a real life character, the star of the show, and we know she wasn't black. Granted it is rated 4.3.Here, at least, they try to explain it. The theory that Queen Charlotte had black ancestry has been a long running historical theory (yes, fine, likely disproven) for centuries, they picked up on that and spun an adaptation around it. Why not.Wouldn't quite explain how in the course of her lifetime, then, the entire high society was de-segregated.But at least they put some thought into it.That, combined with the fact that the queen was not the central character, and honestly, I think that was the least of this series problems.I'm curious to read the books. Sounds like the characters lost a lot of their personalities here. Simon is gorgeous but has 3 emotions max. Anthony is. Just. Not. Likeable. Ugh. Wish we knew more about the featherington father. Benedict had a half sketched story.I also do wish people would stop comparing this to downtown abbey. There is a level of subtlety, fineness and sophistication in the DA stories and the dialogue... bridgerton doesn't come close.This show started slow but got better before it got worse again. The individual episode ratings tell the story. But even bad popcorn is still popcorn , and I'm ok indulging in bad popcorn sometimes.Set your expectations low, turn off critical thinking and you'll be fine.",7
We get it!,"As a viewer who didn't read the books I binged the show in one day. I enjoyed the characters, costumes and locations. Honestly a show doesn't have to be historically/racially correct to be entertaining. Watch it, it's good.",10
Waste Your Time with. Gossip. Sexism. Beautiful Aristocrats. Love. Sex. Mystery.,"I quite enjoyed watching this series and I'll tell you why!
Trying to figure out who is author of the gossip paper.
I didn't bother myself with the color of the cast. But the talent is there. It is NOT an American Historical piece. It does not even take place in America. Take joy in watching this series for pure enjoyment of fantastical entertainment. How gossip gossip gossip kept life interesting in a time where there was no radio, tv, and computers. How women were to look pretty, and how a man can easily ruin a woman's dignity or even her family name. How a man could be a gentlemen or be a crazy spoiled hissy footer (when you watch the series you'll know who I am talking about). I didn't LOVE how this series was written as some of these teenage characters, though of aristocrats, seemed to lack a certain amount of sex education. But I don't know how much education these girls were even allowed to have back then...so... let's move on.If you choose to watch this series, you'll notice that some of the music during their many 'balls' through out - there are actually modern songs played classically and it was something I quite enjoyed when heard.If you have time to waste, and you want to be swept away into an era of aristocrats and noblemen and women, gossip and sex. you can waste it on this.
Follow to the story of an girl in an aristocratic family looking to give her hand away in the search for a husband. Finding love in a predictable way. A gossip paper spreads news around the town which spoils the name of a number aristocratic families, so much so that even Queen wants to know who the author of this gossip paper is.",7
Just don't,Stop the propaganda of modern vulgarity. Netflix is obsessed with cheap vulgarity. This is becoming a pattern. I know why they do that. It's all psychological propaganda. This tv-show doesn't add any value. A shallow and empty tv-show where the characters are nothing but a bunch of hormonal beings with a deficit moral compass. Don't waste your time guys. Cheap entertainment,1
Pure unadulterated enjoyment!,"Pure unadulterated enjoyment!! A wonderful, theatrical, dramatic, romantic Production. Wonderful costumes, delicious relationships and characters. I can't wait to watch more! Thank you to cast and crew for giving us this in 2020!",9
Amazing,"I've read the book years back and this was a really good adaption from book to series. They captured everything, every little detail. It took me a day tk finish it all. The actors,the costumes,the dialogue,the acting everything was good",10
what a lovely syrup,"Pride and Prejudice, @Emma and O Clone in a marvolous series! I pure enjoy it!",7
Brilliant!,"I hadn't heard of the books but added this to my list when I saw it was produced by Shonda. Julie Andrews as the narrator, beautiful sets, clothes and photography plus modern songs by string quartets. Why can't people take shows for what they are - absolutely exquisite escapism?! Loved every second of this!",9
"A fun, light soap","Don't look historical accuracy. It's meant to be light fun and who wouldn't appreciate that these days? The dialogue is quick, the fashion gorgeous and the sets are lovely.",6
Enjoyable soft porn in period costumes!,"Apart from the ""woke"" lenses through which this series is made, and which I have simply ignored, there is a certain unity of style that keeps one glued to the screen. Taken as a fairy tale for adults, it is most enjoyable, at least as long as you don't really take it seriously. Very witty dialogues, superb costumes and very sexy actors and actresses of all sexes, races and life-styles, if you pardon my French!",8
Had to sit through Season1 just for Season2!,I have so many issues with S1 but season2 is amazing.Especially Daphne and her relationship with Simon was so problematic.I'm talking about the SA sceneKate and Anthony are just phenomenal. Again both of them are flawed characters but not as problematic as season1.,
A feast for the eyes but somewhat one note,"Bridgerton is a visually appealing period drama that is unashamedly lavish, gaudy and modern. Costume and set design, while likely to anger those who care for historical accuracy in their period dramas, are fabulous and over the top. The cast is diverse and the score is filled with string quartet interpretations of modern hits.Despite the flashy visuals I found he almost singular focus on the romantic relationships of characters became dull after a while. I think some more developed subplots could have helped keep my interest.",6
Absolutely worth the watch,"I read the books so long ago and loved them, so I was excited to hear about a Netflix adaptation. I loved it. I think it was wonderfully done. Though Shondaland took some liberties with the story and added plotlines and characters, it stayed true the overall story. I enjoyed it and can't wait to see what they come up with next.",10
It was okay,"I love historical fiction, but this just didn't sit right with me. I enjoyed the first couple of episodes and then the show just got boring. They used sex to make things interesting and ""spice"" the storyline up, but I didn't think the main characters had very much chemistry, so the sex scenes were boring. Plus I know this is an unpopular opinion but Daphne 100% committed spousal rape. Daphne held Simon down while having sex forcing him to give her a baby. And the look she gave him afterwards made me sick. Thankfully I was prepared for this scene since research on the show warned me. On the flip side Simon should have been honest and told her he simply didn't want children, and not that he couldn't. A trigger warning needs to be added to the beginning of the episode. The one thing that I found fascinating was how uneducated women were about life, and why education, especially education about women's bodies and sex is so important. This isn't a show I will find myself watching over and over like Downton Abbey, and it had so much potential. The costumes, music and sets were beautiful, but it lacked direction. I think reading the books would be more entertaining and fill in the gaps.",6
Don't see the fuss,"Nothing about this show makes sense and it does nothing to address the obvious issues. Its a funny fantasy world but nobody should refer to this as a ""period drama"" as it is a complete alternate universe where race doesn't seem to exist or be acknowledged, nor are any of the characters enduring. Waste of time and bears no historical reference whatsoever.",1
"Great romance, pure fun","If you are looking for something fun and entertaining this is your series. Simon and Daphne are magic. For everything we have gone thru in 2020, this is a refreshing get away. Loved it!",10
Love it!!,Absolutely worth watching! Truly hope there are many more seasons to come.,10
Nice attempt,"Politically correct frivoulous soap opera with a modern touch, in a Marie Antoinette and Great Gatsby fusion. A XIX version of Gossip Girl. Just more boring, actually, in it's attempt of affectation.",6
This is a fun fantasy series,I love this series. The characters are well developed.the landscape is beautiful. And the crazy match making balls are dazzling. Its nice to see people of ALL races and colors participating in LIFE. Not just boring white people. They also explain how the main characters became royalty and how that can change at a drop of a hat..this was a great escape movie..nothing more..the acting is fun also..I truly enjoyed this series,9
Perfectly enjoyable but I dont understand the hype.,"It was fine. I enjoyed it but it was very basic. I'm not really sure what all the fuss was about.I was expecting something a bit more sophisticated, clever and different but it just appeared to be a normal soap opera-esque tv show dressed up in period costume.Nonetheless, I did enjoy it! I'm just not sure if I'll tune into season 2.",6
"Not what I wanted, but that's okay!","As an avid Julia Quinn fan, it's difficult not to feel a sense of disappointment during the first 15 minutes of Bridgerton. I have read all the books twice and followed her with excitement on social media since the series was announced. My feelings were a little mixed about the casting, but I knew that if this fit Julia's vision, it would work for me.When the series started, I felt like I was watching an episode of Desperate Housewives. Nothing against Desperate Housewives because I'm a fan, but that's not what I was expecting here. I wanted Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle in Pride and Prejudice. I immediately felt embarrassed to have recommended this with such passion to all my friends. I was disappointed. I almost stopped watching.And then I let go of my expectations about what I wanted the series to be and started to enjoy it for what it is. It's lighthearted and it's fun. I'm glad I didn't stop watching!",9
Definitely worth watching,"After I watched couple of first episodes I found out that this show is based on a books written by American author and its a historical romance.
I'm not a fan of romance novels but I was curious what was the original authors idea based on what I've already watched so I stared reading the first book and the binge read 6 of 8 novels while I was binge watching 8 episodes of Bridgerton.
So if you stick to historical accuracy you won't like this adaptation. But do you really need to stick to it?
You need to watch it if you're just into this whole era of lavish costumes, pretty hairdos, long glances,manner of talking and almost Jane Austinish heroes - you're gonna love it.
Can't wait for second season.",8
A wonderful show!,"I read and loved these books many years ago. I thought this show was gorgeous. It was never going to be an exact translation from page to screen, and I'm fine with that. It isn't totally historically accurate, but I'm not viewing it as a history lesson. It's a rich, sumptuous, engaging fiction, set at a particular time in London, with a fabulously diverse cast of great actors bringing Julia Quinn's original imaginings of a particular society to vibrant life.",9
much better than season 1,"In season 1 I couldn't imagine caring for Anthony this much but this season really helped us understand his character much better. Episode 3 was so good with all the flashbacks and I felt really bad for him. His character development was amazing and it made me so happy he finally started to believe in love. Kate's character was also my favorite, they make such a great couple. I never read the books so adding a love triangle didn't bother me, nor any other changes. As a hopeless romantic I enjoyed every part of it, I didn't find it cringe.In my opinion, their love story was much better than Daphne & Simon's and I also liked these caracters more. Other siblings had good storylines as well so I'd say this season was better in general. They had more chemistry and better acting.",9
Watched from start to finish - addictive!,"Cannot fault it! Every episode left me wanting more.The Series is superb, the actors are excellent, the costumes, settings, scenery and music are absolutely stunning.I do hope they hurry up with season 2 as it's just PERFECT.",10
Excellent!,"As someone who has read the entire series, many times, this was an excellent portrayal of the books. I love the diversity of the cast and every person played their part to perfection. Thank you Shonda and Netflix for bringing this to the screen. I truly hope you do the entire series. The stories are quite remarkable and get even better as they go along since you get to see the evolution of every family along the way.",10
Pride & Prejudice Meets Gossip Girl,"Pride & Prejudice meets Gossip Girl with a sprinkle of 50 Shades LOL I actually really liked this series and hope there is a second season. Production was beautiful, storyline was captivating and the chemistry between the actors was great! I highly recommend",9
Hideous,"What an unpleasant show. If I wanted to see sordid sex, ho hum costumes and bad acting I could watch any number of Netflix shows. I was shocked how bad this was! And really, if you don't want to present a period piece then perhaps pick a different project!",1
"Nice take on a historical piece, Shondaliscious","For the most part I enjoyed this little romp into history with its unusual take on the drama of the time. I liked the mix of characters and casting choices. Some of the characters were great, some were not. I like the fact that women again proved much smarter than men. Some of it dragged and there was way too much sex (unnecessary sex). If you let go of some of the boring parts and some ridiculous characters, its good for a girlfriend binge.",8
Entertaining!!!!!,"Bridgerton is very entertaining. Love the mystery of trying to figure out Lady Whistledown. Love the romance and the steamy love scene between Lord Hasting and Daphne. The storyline with the pregnant Marina Thompson performance was magnificent. The Featherington family entertaining. The queen was hilarious looking like Wanda Sykes in a wig and Lady Danbury was excellent. To all the people that are leaving low reviews. I didn't watch ""Bridgerton"" for a history lesson. I am very well educated regarding the time period. I watched Bridgerton to be entertained and it did not disappoint. Thumbs up. Ten stars across the board.",10
So far so good!,"I must admit I don't catch everything because they talk so fast in their British accents but I'm enjoying it so far! The costumes are lovely and while some of the acting is a bit campy, I still enjoy it all. It's a spectacle to be hold for sure!",8
Wonderful.....,"... and fresh show within an outstanding script and production. Underline with actress and actors .... you can see in every frame the joy acting.
The soundtrack are the top cerry of a wonderful entertaining cake show.
A wonderful season 1 and I can't wait to see season 2. Hopefully again with such a brilliant cast and production team.
Yes, I love the cast. This is not a history pic., this is entertaining at his best.",8
Alternative history - I liked it,"I see that the historical ""incorrectness"" of this show - the presence of black people in the british 1800s high society - got some people confused or even got them to dislike the show, but for me it was a refreshing, playful and very necessary correction of history. Why does a historical tv show - fiction after all - has to represent history correctly, especially when that history is the actual incorrectness? I really liked the alternative history they presented.
I enjoyed the show, the characters, the costumes and the love story. If you don't like romantic costume drama, you'd better skip this one.",8
"""I love you, no I don't... go away! Come back! 🙄","Anthony got robbed of a potential good series.Kate was my favorite at the beginning but her own constant ""yes, no"" I hate you, I love you"", ""go away!"" ""Come back"" ""stop!"" ""Don't stop""...THE WORST CHARACTER EVER!!! So ANNOYING.I had to force myself to watch THE MOST ANNOYING character and thr worst story ever.Jonathan Baylee deserved better.Kate's character is beyond cringy and annoyinh.",1
True to the spirit of the book,Loved every second of it. Stays surprisingly accurate to the books. I was at first wary of the acting choice for Simon but I have to say he was perfect! The show also did a good job of incorporating narratives from the other books to prepare for the next seasons.,8
Bitter- Super Genius Reviewers.,"Hey sad people.
I'm referring to people who gave 1-2-3-4-5/10 etc. What exactly would you like to see in this show, what you would like to watch?
I'm trying very hard not to swear or say something bad ha?
Perhaps everything must stop because in your little sad brain everything is much below average.AS A READER. AS A WOMAN WHO NEVER STOPPED READING ABOUT ANYTHING, I FOUND MANY OF YOUR COMMENTS OFFENSIVE AND..... PERHAPS YOUR IQ IS LOW. MAYBE YOU SHOULD ADMIT THAT.We live in 2021 everything has been said, everything has been done. So perhaps everyone you rate this series with 1-5 you should stop watch T.V. OK? You should leave the rest of us the stupid people, the less genius persons to watch something, okay?I HAVE NEVER RATE ANYTHING WITH 1! PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE ME, MUST SPEAK ABOUT THEM!THOSE WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN ANYTHING, WHO IS DISRESPECTFUL ABOUT EVERYTHING, WHO INSULT ANY EFFORT, the saddest, the LOWERS. THOSE SAD PEOPLE.The series is fine.More than fine.
The cast is great.
Please have the brain not to compare it with any book - it's sad-
The story is fine.
Haters are always people who feel less.
This isn't all about that show. WAKE UP WORLD. WE DON'T NEED THOSE PEOPLE, YOU AREN'T LIKE THEM.",10
"Yes it's fictional, but it's amazing","Is it accurate to historical reality? No. Does that mean it's bad? Absolutely not! Finally a good costume drama, that provides jobs for both white and black actors! Usually I'm not a big fan of anything that's romantic or dramatic, but I'm 100% swooning over these series. And I really needed this, because let's be honest... this pandemic has been a real Debbie Downer to movies/series. Couldn't find anything good to watch for a while, until I found this!",10
You're missing out on a great story if you're worried about the fact that people in positions of power are black in this show.,"This show was so addicting and so good that I finished the entire season in one sitting.
Bridgerton is awesome if you are an avid lover and reader of historical romance and regency England. It is so refined and elegant but the show still had me eating out of its palm with drama and mystique.Bridgerton is so full of plays out of the feminist playbook it's a wonder it works so well with a dated setting and society. Women taking control of their own lives, finding their own sensual pleasure without men, getting educations and being on the precipice of adventure. This is a world where racism and colorism is a thing of the (very recent) past BUT one in which a society moves forward and places people of color in equal positions of power quickly. And if you are not paying attention, it is hard to find out when that transition actually took place.This is not a show meant to be ""historically accurate"". As some have tried to relay towards their judgment on its entertainment value. This is a show in which modern (2020) music is given a classical and voracious touch of the orchestra. Where young readers, watchers and lovers of ball gowns, secret lives, courting and duels at dawn; especially those of color, can see themselves in stories that are predominantly white and elitist. This show hits all the high notes of romance and sensuality and violence and mystery and suspense and I cannot wait for the second season.",10
Utter Perfection - BRING ON SEASON 2!!!,"Gorgeous, witty, innocent, sexy, poignant, colorful, sexy, quirky, relatable, fantastical, perfection...did i mention sexy? I have not read the books, but plan to now. Im a huge fan of period series, Poldark being my favorite, this is just as enjoyable, with more hot moments btwn the lead characters. Satisfying in every way. Going to rewatch from start to finish once i post this review!!! Dear Netflix, PLZ RENEW!!! We need more!!!!",10
Boring drivel,"If you want a slow paced, dull, and incoherent drama, sprinkled with enough eye candy to prevent you from crying with boredom, you're in the right place. My flatmate uses it as background when they're working on admin. I'm not sure how this holds the attention of viewers who are watching it for entertainment though. Obviously tastes vary, but I don't get it, and believe me, I have tried.With Bridgerton's budget I'd like to see some realism, but this looks like modern-day actors playing dress-up. I'm not even going to get into the colour-blind casting, which is a product of an infuriatingly shallow American identity politics, but is ultimately so daft in its results that they're barely worth engaging with.There's some stunning actors, clothing, and scenery, sure. But there's also lots of crap wigs and distractingly ugly makeup. A lot of it doesn't seem crap in a ""historical realism"" way, just in a ""the costume/wigs/makeup departments were drunk"" way. And the plot isn't interesting enough for suspending disbelief to be a worthwhile use of energy. Who are these people and why should I care about them? Sorry, I'm too much of a humourless republican (the anti monarchy sort, not the 'stop transing our daughters!' type).The wee lesbian from Derry Girls is a highlight, bringing up what would be a two star rating to a three. She's too good for this mess.Overall, if Bridgerton is what's popular on Netflix, it's no wonder people are cancelling their subscriptions. I've seen more entertaining QVC ads to be honest.",3
Amazing!!!!,"Loved every minute... well casted, beautiful sets.... bring on series 2!!!",10
season 2,"I loved season 1 but i am honest i loved the duke the most and i really missed him in season 2. But season 2 was beautifull the costumes the whole scenery. For me i am not that fond on eloise so her story was a bit annoying ,the love story between anthony and kate was great and i even fell butterflys when they looked at eachother. Kate is a beautifull woman and it is so great that there is so much diversety in this world .Just love it. So sad that we must wait for a year?",8
A bit of fun!,"This show was so wonderful! The drama, the costumes, the 1800s vibes, I loved it all! And such a refreshingly diverse cast for a bit of escapism. The plot was predictable and enjoyable, the wardrobe and sets a joy to watch, and the classical reimagining of modern music was a great twist. The whole thing was a treat for the senses from start to finish. I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoyed Gossip Girl or Pride and Prejudice and anything in between. Can't wait for the next season!",9
Sweet romance,"A story about prejudices of fate and posibilities to cope with your injuries, to heal. Gossips, life, intimate space, desires, people, love story.
Full of blind actions that somehow guided to happiness at the end. Life maybe not always be like that, but this movie is",8
It's Entertaining. Really.,"Never having read the books but seeing Netflix's Top 10 indication for this series, I started watching the first episode. What??!! I mean I truly understand that there is a scarcity of roles for Black actors in period pieces, but, how can they honestly believe that viewers would accept the suggestion that many members of the British aristocracy had very dark skin, and that racism at that time did not exist? However, after muttering, ""What, are they joking?"" a few more times, I totally forgot about all this and started to really enjoy this series. In fact, I now love this series.Much seems historically accurate. For example, women were slaves to the social mores of the time. They could only strive to make good matches, the only way they could further their social standing which in turn would further that of their siblings, etc. An out of wedlock pregnancy meant the total ruination of one's entire family.My only complaint here would be that the sex scenes were way overdone. Otherwise, this enjoyable, historical series is a great way to get one's mind off our problem-filled present.",8
Absolute Garbage,This is total garbage. Please stop ruining historical dramas.,1
The best thing that happened in 2020,"I always loved Jane Austin themed movies and I am so delighted to finally see people of color included, I don't care if it is historically correct. The costumes are stunning, the love stories are captivating, the Duke is the perfect portrait of a real person with baggage like ours,a real man that needs to be loved. The music is incredible, I literally can't find one flaw to these series. You can't stop watching if you start.",10
Spectacular binge worthy viewing.,"Loved this series. The costumes, the use of the English language, the scenery and the Queens hair. Julie Andrews is icing on the cake. Highly recommended.",10
Awesome acting.,"Beautiful settings and couture.
Nice story of daily worries of the so called upperclass",10
To all of you self-proclaimed historians and pseudo-intellectuals,"It is not without sarcasm, I'm breaking to you that queen Charlotte was most likely mixed-raced and Regency England was much more colourful than you can learn from your significantly white-washed history books for sixth graders. Having said that, Bridgerton is not about history. It's about feelings, about the most complex of them all, namely - love. What I admire the show for is that it doesn't try to over-analyze the feeling. In the same time, it proves that mutual attraction between two people has no chance of surviving without anchoring it in friendship and without courage to communicate openly fears and admit weaknesses. The show is tastefully filmed, has music score which probably will make history and the two main characters are not only beautiful humans but also conveyed by the very young actors feelings seem incredibly genuine. Which is more than one can say about the most of contemporary TV productions/movies. Kudos, hat tip and big thank you to all of the team for proving to this cynical, old lady that ""true love conquer all"" not necessarily has to sound like a cliché...",10
Couldn't Stop Watching!,"Although off to a slow start, after the first few episodes I was hooked.Beautiful costumes, diversity, and an escape from the pandemic world.Don't take it too seriously and get hung up on logistics. Allow your brain to switch off for an hour or two and enjoy a beautifully put together love story.",10
Worst series ever!! Complete waste of time!!,Season 1 was watchable but Season 2 turned me sick. I had to endure it for my girl friend.The show directors spent a lot of effort in costume and flower show and not even 30% of those efforts to proper story & plot. Such boring stuff.,1
entertaining,"The stoey is pretty entertaining... from enemies to fake dating and later married. it's the usual but i still like it. the story itself is really slow so i don't think it needed 8 episodes but it's okay i guess? it's a love story after all. it shows how each person has different love journey and ending even if it's mostly about simon and daphne. overall it's a good watch, but i wouldn't watch it the second time though.",8
AMEIIII,"O QUE FALAR DE BRIDGERTON...
FICOU PERFEITOOOO
AMEI TUDO DO INICIO AO FIM, CADA LAGRIMA DERREAMADA FOI A CERTEZA QUE BRIDGERTON VAI SEMPRE FICAR GUARDADO NO CORAÇÃO.
O REGÉ É A PHOEBE DERAM UM SHOW DE ATUAÇÃO ASSIM COMO O ELENCO INTEIRO. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤",10
Well done period drama,"Thoroughly enjoyable. It plays like Masterpiece Theater only with more sex. Ignore the racists rating it down because of the multicultural cast... the story and acting is so well done, you won't notice or care.",9
Enjoyable,An enjoyable watch that I was unaware was based on a series of novels.,9
Liked it!,"The movie was unconventional, but well written and entertaining. Great choice of actors. I can't wait to see if there will be a season 2.",8
"Watching clothes spinning in the dryer, is a better use of your time than watching this...","After reading people's rave reviews, and being a fan of period romances, I decided to give Bridgerton a go. From the outset I was irritated by the almost farcical nature of the setting, the choice of actors for the various roles and their somewhat limited acting skills. I was prepared to overlook the innacuracy and the clichéd PC approach to the portrayal of the Regency period, as I knew that it was intended to be purely fictional entertainment. However, what really spoilt it for me was, after reading the glowing compliments on the standard of the costumes, noticing the spike heels of the queen's dancer 18:10 minutes into episode 2. Seriously? Yes, period romances are known for the sumptious and often extravagant costumes, and in most cases, every effort is made by producers to get these as accurate as possible and in keeping with the time period, as this is what sets it apart and creates the ""period piece"" identity for this genre. Using spike heels, which were only invented in the 1950's, in a period piece set in the very early1800's, would in my mind be a faux pas on the same level as using a cell phone or other modern accoutrement. To top it all, my irratation turned into disgust upon hearing ""classical"" renderings of music by modern artists like Ariana Grande, Maroon 5, Celeste etc. in the background. I mean really? The producers couldn't even give the series a semblance of period accuracy by using music by great Regency era composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, Rossini, Schubert, Liszt or Mendelssohn, to name but a few. I was so put off, irritated and critical after the abovementioned, that I barely made it through to the end of episode 5, before deciding that it is an utter waste of my time. If you have anything better to do, even if it is just watching clothes spinning in the dryer, rather do that than watch Bridgerton.",1
Bridgertons - a series worth watching,"I am not one to review shows or any kind at all. But to be honest, I honestly do not think that people has given this show enough chances. While it may be unrealistic especially due to the diversity of the characters I do find it refreshing to have a show that is diverse.It's a fun, witty show that is NOT to be taken too seriously. With everything that has been going on in our reality this show definitely gets me out of it, even for just a moment. And that to me is enough to make this show a worthy to watch.",8
You have to watch this without expectations...,"If you read these novels, apparently you'll likely be disappointed. (I did not read them)If you're looking for historical accuracy, this won't be your show.If you want deep characters with absolutely inspired writing, you might want to pass.That said, this show can still be entertaining if you come into watching it with an open mind.The best description I can come up with is Gossip Girl in Hamilton style set in Pride and Prejudice produced by Shondaland. At its base, it is a drama set up around a mysterious gossip paper - expecting from that to see perfectly time-set wardrobe and music is like expecting Gossip Girl to have been realistic about life in NYC. It's just not. Like Hamilton, you have a theoretical time period dominated by white royalty but reimagined with POC. So again, if you're looking for time period realness, this won't be your show.I've seen a lot of complaints about the characters on here. I have to say I didn't feel the same - I felt myself rooting for Daphne and Simon. I connected with characters: one with a birthright he does not want, a couple who wants to break norms in a time ruled by them, a character who wants to find love but finds complicated setbacks at every turn, another torn between his malice towards a father who never loved him and his love, a mother fighting for her daughters against odds, etc. Are they immensely deep? No. Do they put together a decent storyline that can keep you amused for an 8 hour first season? I think so...or at least it did for me.It's more rated-R scenes are also kind of...cute? The naïveté and genuineness on behalf of either character to me were far more adorable than the call room hookups from Grey's.Overall, it's not Emmy winning drama gold. But I don't think we usually come to ShondaLand shows expecting that gold (at least not since 2006-7 Grey's Anatomy). We come expecting to be entertained. And it certainly does that so long as you don't allow details of time period or race to stand in the way of a decent story and don't have expectations re: how true this show will be to the novels.",8
Enjoyably Entertaining,"For people who gave this series a low rating because they didn't agree with the diverse cast due to the time period, era or etc., please relax, no crime has been committed. It's just TV. This series has drama, romance, and comedy. Simply Entertaining. If you can't get pass the diversity and etc., then you will not be entertained because your stuck in your head to busy comparing your perception of reality to a romance book series or TV series.I remembered my mother watching the movie ""Imitation of Life"" when I was a child, and I remembered not fully understanding the movie until I watched it again at an older age. Being at an older age I also understood that Prejudice and racism didn't allow for a biracial black woman to play the role of a biracial black woman passing for a white woman instead they gave the role to a white woman. However I did understand as a child that the character was crying about her mother. If I understood that as a child, then what is It in the year of 2020 that people can not watch a show with diversity and etc.
""Bridgerton"" was truly entertaining.",10
"First season was sexual, second season was sensual","Second season was *chef's kiss"". Season will do it for you too if you are into period dramas but the second one.. The slowburn, the chemistry 🔥, the performance. It is the only time I admit that a sequel of a movie or series is better than the original.",9
Why not?,If you are too concerned about reality than just think that this show is a sci-fi in a parrallel universe! The show is warm and lovely with actors that suit the roles. I just loved it and hope that the next season will come soon.,8
horrible,"Garbage trying to rewrite historyDont waste your time seeing thisNetflix always makes medíocres series is nothing new, but this one overcomesJean page is so hammyThe actions are bad and hammy (especially the protagonist)The writing is horrible and there is a lot of unnecessary sex scene in everything
The costumes are so fake, looks like plastic, you gonna think they are created for childers theatersI dont understand why it received so much positive critivism from the ""specialized criticism""If you like J. A.'S books or british historical dramas, skip this aberraction.",1
Very much worth your Netflix subscriptions!,"An absolute MUST see!! This show really warmed my heart, it had me laughing and crying at the same time. That is down to good writing and amazing acting.There are those rare gems among television series where they really stand out from the rest! This is one of them.",10
I have not read the books,"A lot of times, when a book or series is converted to visual media, the reader that is fond of the book(s) is disappointed with the result. I've seen reviews like that and believe it is usually to be expected.
However, as someone who has Not read the books, I can say that I have thoroughly enjoyed this series, and am eagerly awaiting another season (or 10).
This Netflix series is a joyous presentation of a Romance Novel come to life. The re-imagining of Georgian / Regency Society as integrated is wonderful to see - I especially love Queen Charlotte. Yes, there are historical liberties being taken, but so what? It's not a History Documentary, it's a fun time watching silly romance and drama. This is for fun, not edification. So, if you're in the mood to watch some deliciously spicy romance (not PG-13) and wonderfully served up Scandal Broth (brought to you by the creator of Scandal... yay!), this is the show for you!
I must say, the casting on this is wonderful. Every player is wonderfully cast for their role, and I haven't seen a more beautiful assembly of acting talent in years - if ever. Every single person is, at the very least, interesting in some way, or downright beautiful. I will probably watch this many times while waiting for the next episodes.",9
Questionable acting at points but engaging!,"Clearly an attempt to tick boxes here which brings out the cynic in so many. Also, a historically inaccurate story but a story which may suit the costume drama fans and lovers of historical romance. I'd say give this a go...",8
Charming and fun series based on a romance novel. It's fantastical and that's great.,"The show is charming and fun with quirky characters and intrigue in the lives of the regency ton. Lady Whistledown is a secret gossiper that publishes her work and stirs things up. The show focuses on the Bridgerton family. They are portrayed as respectable and raised well by the mother. By contrast, their neighbors, the Featheringtons are snobbish and desperate to marry off their daughters while dealing with money problems.Ever read a romance novel? Well, this series is based on a romance novel, not realism, tho real historical things exist here. Romance novels are essentially a fantasy type of world. The female finds her perfect match. The guy listens to her, respects her, admires her, finds her smart and interesting. If that's not a fantasy I don't know what is! Modern songs weren't classical covers in this time period either, and Jesus ain't white in our real world. Get it? Ah, but it's a fantasy type of show, essentially an alternative reality and fairy tale, and they can do whatever they want. I'm glad they did.Bonus alert: The racists hate this show! I'm especially amused by the liars in reviews that say that ""I'm a person of color"" or ""I'm black"" and proceed to bash this show. I love that this show is cutting the racists so badly. Especially since it's now Netflix's biggest hit. Sweet, sweet, sweet. Suck it, racists.Oh, and for those that say that this is reverse racism, racism is systemic, with a dominant side that oppresses other races. There is no such thing as reverse racism, because the oppressed group is not dominant in the system, let alone equal. Nice try racists. Suck on that.The show is based on a series of romance novels by Julia Quinn, who started the Bridgerton series in 2000 and is a consultant on the show. My understanding is that each season will focus on a different couple as per her books with one of the Bidgertons.The series is fun and entertaining and lighthearted with likable characters. Everything is rather dark in our real world. I like a move-away from the gritty stuff. I want to see a happy ending and want to see love win. I enjoyed watching it and can't wait for more. 10/10.",10
Cannot understand the bad reviews??? We ALL loved it,"Fine acting, beautiful production and one of the best things I have have ever had the pleasure of seeing and no surprise it is rated 5th best Netflix programme! It deserves to be higher, but then it is rated no 1 in MANY countries!!! so the bad ratings are from people who just 'don't get it'!Season 2?",10
Only positive is Eloise,"So I'll start with the positives. Eloise. She is the most interesting character and easily the best actor in the series. The sets and designs were beautiful also.The negatives... Overall, the series just doesn't work.
It's was interesting they used modern/pop melodies for the soundtrack. But it ultimately felt out of place and was too distracting. I found I would miss entire conversations because I was more interested in working out the songs. The acting was D grade at best and the characters are also very boring. So underdeveloped that I actually didn't care about most of them. Or, even worse, I hoped things would end badly for them. Particularly for Marina, Siena and Simon. Argh... they were just painful to watch. As for the protagonists, they had absolutely zero chemistry. Daphne was no more interesting, or complex, than some ditsy airhead. While a cardboard cutout would have had more charisma and charm, than Simon. I accept he was good looking, but he was just too boring.And the writing - terrible. There's no flow, no charm, no humor, no wit. It's just boring boring boring. And feels clunky and weird most of the time. I literally lost it at 'you do touch yourself?' Thinking - wow, this show is so stupid.It's really unfortunate because the actual concept and story is very good. It just wasn't fleshed out well enough. It's a real pity because there was so much promise.",1
Ignore the bad reviews.,"Not sure where all the hostility is coming from. I thought it was a really fun watch. I enjoyed the romance, the humor, the time period... binged it in 2 days which I rarely ever have time for. Don't pass on this based on other people's bad reviews",9
PLEASE ignore the bad reviews!!,"It is obvious from the very start that it's is going to be highly polished and is superbly produced.
Everything about it is excellent from the brilliantly chosen cast to the sets, the costumes to the clever music!
I found NO fault with it, it has such beautiful variation, scandal, comedy, romance etc! If you don't get it, then move on! The sex scenes are very steamy but you MUST understand why! If you don't then, please get in touch with yourself! and DON'T be a prude!
Great from start to finish! Laughter and tears - Wonderful!!!",10
Very well done indeed!,"To everyone who's hating on Bridgerton1) I'm only 3 episodes in to the series but so far I've found it so refreshing and eloquently done
I haven't read the books, but I might start doing so because of the series2) I personally love that the cast is so diverse, it's a nice change from the constant all white cast in period pieces I've seen3) Historically inaccurate - Sure, Fine but it's a welcome change to see how women were terrified of the economic proposition that marriage was back then. It dictated their entire lives and reputation. When it comes to the social classes and hierarchy, it has always been relevant so to see it on screen shouldn't shock people so muchIn conclusion, I'd recommend to watch it. It has the hunts of period pieces we know and love (yearning, slow burn romance, suspense, and drama). It has a perfect combination of gossip, chemistry, well developed characters, and intriguing plot.
Now I'm off to watch the rest!",10
Representation,"I simply LOVED it, from loyalty to books to choosing characters. I think the thing I liked the most was the choice of the actors, I loved the representation they had with the main black character, the black queen etc.Even though racism at the time was indescribable, they changed that, and that was the best. I loved the sets, and I loved them, I just LOVED the costumes that look like they came out of a fairy tale (and were very expensive). One of the things I didn't like was how Daphne handled Simon's situation, and the loyalty to some characters, but other than that it was perfect.",9
Great Fun - it didnt happen like this you know !,"This is a drama for the times ( 2020s) . The sets are amazing, stunningly so. The costumes well thought out. Queen Charlotte, the King's Wife ( George III) is interestingly Afro-Caribbean and her staff dressed in court dress of around 1750. Courts as we know, never move with the times.
The dialogue and themes are 21st century. Jane Austen is sufficiently replayed that one can watch that for authentic period dialogue
No one has four daughters ""coming out"" at one time. Each one came out in a different year and had to find a husband by the years end.
Lord Berborough visits ""at home"" without visiting cards. More shocking The Duke has no cravat at a society ball !
A servant wears his bicorn hat crossways - 'like a ship in full sail' coming towards you. The last person to do that was 25 y prior, one Horatio Nelson.
The more modern way was as the line that one walked.
At one At Home, the lady of the house converses with the visitor - who appears to visit without a manservant - whilst two daughters play cards and one a harp. The girls of course should be around the visitor listening to what she had to say
Excellent drama, and I recommend it to everyone. As for - did it ever happen once? No, it is a drama.",8
cringe,"Cringed watching this show....
Mostly dull and/or dislikeable characters, absurd dialogue, mostly bad acting, anachronistic etc.
Not fun or charming or thoughtful or educational - just ugh.
Basically Sex and the City in expensive period costume.",1
A Great moment !,"If you like history with romance, action and great actors you are at the good place ! Loved the books love even more the série even though some things don't totally match but that's normal as it is an adaptation and a great one !
I watched all the episodes over a night ! So addictive and well played",9
"Period drama, romance and mystery","I have read all the bridgerton books and I must say I am happy with the results of the adaption. Some areas has been modified to reflect modern subjects which gives the series more point and at times relatable feeling. Janes Austin styles with a few more saucy moments, enjoyed it so much, watch it all in one day! Would recommend to anyone",9
Great period drama,"Really enjoyed this. Story line is great. Characters are casted well and the acting is great.
Looking forward to the series... bought the book as I can't wait",10
💙💙,Can't describe how much I loved it! Pls let them be a 2nd season,10
Really Fun,Is it high-brow entertainment? No. Is it fun and melodramatic and pretty much what I expect from a Regency Romance? YepI really feel like the negative reviews that are upset they cast black people in the show and that's what ruined the historical accuracy really need to re-examine themselves. Last I checked everyone also has perfect dental work and the vast majority of the women are surviving childbirth.Not to mention if you're watching a Regency Romance for the historical accuracy you're going to be sorely disappointed in general.,9
Dreadful!,"Mind you I rated s1 a 10. I just loved it. Everything worked. Nothing wrong the actors in this one. I think they did a good job actually, considering what they were working with. Whoever wrote the script must have been high on meth cause huh?. Unlike s1 this one took a whole different course unrelated to the book that it was supposed to be about. I was so disappointed. They should have stuck to the books. Hopefully moving forward they will go back and at least incorporate 80% of the storyline in the following books.",5
An incredible story,"Incredible story, with a good soundtrack and a great cast. In fantasy everything is allowed, only not racism.",10
History lesson,"Vivian Leigh, a Brit born in Calcutta played Scarlett O'Hara, the daughter of an Irish plantation owner in the American South
Natalie Wood, the daughter of Russian immigrants, played Maria in West Side Story
John Wayne played Genghis Khan; Burt Lancaster played Cochise; Mickey Rooney played Japanese in Breakfast at Tiffany's.
People only object to diversity casting when it goes agains their prejudices.
And diversity casting or not, this series is great...especially for those who wouldn't be caught dead reading a Romance novel.",10
Season 2 is wow!,"Season one was good (rated 7) Season two is flat out spectacular and I have to rate the series a 9 now, averaged because I'd like to give season 2 a point above 10. Acting, sets, costumes, music, writing is wonderful. I wish some would stop comparing to the books. Why would you even watch it if you're looking for it to be exactly like the books? Doesn't that seem like a dull prospect?The chemistry between Kate and Anthony is palpable and so much stronger acted and interesting than between Daphne and the duke in season 1.",9
Excellent!,Awesome series. Can't wait for more! The costume and cast were great! Loved how the book was brought to life.,10
It's an 'adaptation' for a reason...,"People trashing this show are just mad because it's not identical to the books... This show was actually good, the actors were phenomenal and I was captivated from beginning to end. Enjoy the Shonda magic... if you haven't read the books, read them... they are great but this show is good too. Surely I can't be the only one who understands the meaning of the word 'adaptation'? Surely people don't believe a series is going to be word for word as the books??",10
Far inferior to the first season,"What a disappointment after the first Season.Boring, riddled with inconsistencies and a very bland plot line, this season was more than difficult to get through. The only redeeming feature was the diversity seen throughout and the representation of the Indian culture through the Charmers.",1
The Marshmallow Chronicles,As we say in french: « c'est cucul ».A series full of good feelings and marshmallow. My wife loves it.A good point for the use of pop music titles in classical music version. The game being to discover the title and the performer. Failing to be passionate about the scenario.,8
A hoot!,"When I first started watching Bridgerton, I thought, ""What in the world?"". Then I caught on to the fact that it is campy and fun and entertaining...not meant to be taken as historically accurate. So people should just take it for what it is and relax. As one reviewer so eloquently put it, ""Thinking Bridgerton is historically accurate is like thinking Superman is a documentary!"". That statement is a hoot! Ok, so I need more characters to post. I am looking forward to season 2 because reviewers say it is better, but I have been enjoying season 1 as just a visually pleasing and relaxing bit of escapism.",8
"This is Not The Stuff I Watch, But a Skillful Rendition","To begin, I normally can't stand stories like this, but kudos to the acting, directing, plot-pace and scripting - all of this excellence - make this high-brow romp a well rounded tale. Does this mean I will immediately leap into the first empty seat as soon as the very recognizable melodious theme resonates throughout the house? Not hardly. Regrettably, lack of gunfights, explosions and car chases normally ejects me from any suspected presence of pending boredom. Oddly enough, I am quite pleased. I actually sat and watched some of this show and was very pleased. As previously cited, the acting, directing and general production are far above average, excelling well beyond the current idiocy posing as entertainment. The maturity in which diversity is skillfully molded into a flowing script is uniquely presented. Lacking is the typical and ridiculous puerile spiteful banter of 'all men are evil', especially white men. Intelligent delivery is much more palatable than hate and decisiveness. Will I continue to watch, maybe.",10
Amazing cute full with hope,I loved it! I watched and finished Netflix in 2020 but this today on xmas day was such a delight. I need season 2,10
Confession/Dirty Little Secret: I Loved It!,"Season One: The Duke and I (or The Diamond and the Roguish Duke)This is a Shonda Rhimes treatment of a fictional historical regency era British romance novel titled The Duke and I by Julia Quinn. One of those novels that you see at the grocery story, typically snickered at and read maybe by house wives...covers often of the torn bodice variety...with men on the cover looking like the infamous Fabio. Do not going in to this series thinking that it is in any way a historically accurate portrayal of regency era anything...have you seen any of Shonda Rhimes other works of fiction?If, however, you go in to the series thinking this is going to be a mixed cast romp in regency era costumes filled with sex, lavish scenes...and gossip(Shonda's bread and butter), you might find that it is colorful, funny and maybe even a little bit sexy.I had no expectations going in, I have never read the original books...and honestly I am not a big fan of Shonda Rimes other productions. Right from the start I was really struck by all of the historical inaccuracies, and that is with my inexpert knowledge, but some of the dialogue started to make me laugh...the lush sets drew on my imagination and I really hung in for the friendship and blooming relationship between our two main characters, Daphne and Simon. I know I am a sucker for romance and that is what slid this in to a dirty little secret, you know the ones you are ashamed to admit that you enjoyed!Season one is ultimately the story of the oldest daughter and fourth of eight Brigerton siblings, Daphne, and her first season coming out to the elite ""ton"" (ie attempt to snare a husband as all good girls of her time are expected to do). In her presentation to the queen she is favored with her eye and listed in the gossip rags as this season's ""Diamond"". Her eldest brother and head of the family, Anthony's job is to help Daphne procure a proper match for her and the family. Anthony, who knows more than he should about men's more baser desires and habits, takes his job a little too seriously and manages to scare off the majority of eligible suitors in just the first few days. Daphne meets the arrogant Duke Simon, who happens to be a good friend from Anthony's from boarding school which is how Anthony knows he is entirely unsuitable for Daphne...or so he thinks.Daphne and Simon out of desperation strike up an agreement to fake a courtship. This will work twofold, it will make Daphne seem more desirable to suitors and keep Simon off the market for pushy moms after his title. During this fake courtship, their hate changed to friendship...and maybe love?This isn't the end of the drama as there is a large back story involving Simon's youth, relationship with his father and why he doesn't want to have children. This provides the story with the classic romance angst and obstacles or impediments to the couples happiness. There are also the side stories of the other Brigerton siblings, all eight named in alphabetical order, and some of their friends and neighbors. In addition, there is a story only hinted at in this season about the Queen and her relationship with her husband, the King.I enjoyed this enough that I will be checking out season two...please don't disappoint me Shonda Rhimes and writer Chris Van Dusen.",8
Wonderful,"A perfect adaptation of Julia Quinn's books, In addition to having an incredible and diverse cast that brings a lot of representativeness, which is very important nowadays, and it's really sad that there are so many people talking badly about such a good series because of disgusting racism... Anyway watch Bridgerton !! it's a beautiful series and you won't regret it !!",10
Season 2 is even better,"I love period drama, the more historically accurate the better. This is not historically accurate but it is good entertainment. I've seen 4/8 of season 2 and I am pleasantly surprised. There is a very intense tension between the two main carachters and I could hardly leave the series to get some sleep. Well done team Bridgerton 👍🏼!",9
"Beautiful costumes, dancing, and diversity!","Leave it to Shonda Rhimes to put a fun and colorful spin on a medieval period piece! If you're looking for historical accuracy, watch The Crowne instead.
This is make-believe - pure and simple - with more beautiful costumes (and people) than plot. But they explain the diverse nobility as the result of the the king falling in love and marrying a black woman. Thus, nobility included all people of color in this land of make believe. Nothing about political correctness for Shonda Rhimes. In fact she did a similar medieval spin on Romeo and Juliet series for ABC . It's a Shondaland world and we get a fun glimpse into it. Enjoy the ride.",9
Fun capers,"I have not read the book, so am new to this story. Loved the characters, the diversity, the romance, the strong female characters trying to assert themselves in a time when women were anything but independent. Romance, mystery, intrigue, real life messes, and good messages. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",9
"Waste of time, and money.","The amount of money that goes into the making of this show pains me, as the creators of it would also preach about issues of the world such as poverty. The first season was at least at a decent pace with some chemistry. However, the second season was one of the most boring things ever created. The best acting came from on-screen mother and son, and Penelope and Eloise at the very end. And that is not saying much. I regret wasting any time on it at all.",1
Loved it.,"Honestly, i watched this show in 3 days and i loved it.Is it my fav series of all time ? Absolutely not, but it was fun watching and somethimes you just need a serie like this !",9
A new guilty pleasure!,"This may not be the deepest, best written show, BUT it is has all the drama and excitement a person would want in a fun romance. It is literally Gossip Girl with the characters wearing 1800s clothing. If you're looking for historical accuracy, this show doesn't have it whatsoever. If you're looking for drama, love, sex, and a beautiful setting, well this is for you! I enjoyed each episode and would recommend you check it out too!",9
I liked this parallel universe,So yeah. I have not read the books. BUT this series seems to me to be more of a parallel universe. From the moment it is mentioned that the king married someone of colour and that made it ok for all people of colour to rise and make normal lives of themselves for that period... this is what I wish our past would have looked like... the way things could have been in a more open-minded world... where colour just gets out of the equation and everybody has a fair chance. I personally liked it because I actually took it as a piece of FICTION. And everyone here just complaining that it's not a 100% adaptation of the book... It is not a 100% adaptation of the book. It's a nice world and option we could have had in another life. So.... yeah.,9
love it!,"Simon and Daphne's relationship was very sweet. In some places the drama repeated itself, it was a bit boring but in general I had fun and liked it",8
Loved it!,"I advise you all not to take this all so seriously and close to heart. This is just a fun and light series with beautiful costumes, great music and good actors. I loved Simon & Daphne duet, their chemistry is over the roof and both actors are perfect for their charecters.",9
Over contrived crap,My goodness the acting in this is painful! Was it this over the top on purpose?? The majority of the cast have at least one eyebrow raised at all times. The script is terrible and trying to be too wordy with everyone outdoing each other with 'witty' repartee. I love the diversity of the cast but it was a hard watch. Like viewing a period drama while smacked off my head on LSD.,1
Beautiful,"Could not wait to binge season 2.Let me say, visually and musically it did not disappoint. The costumes were beautiful, the settings were magnificent, the music composition was excellent.I love how the actors are from different ethnicities and how the integration into the storylines have a a natural feel. It is so refreshing, I wish more movies and series could do this.I did find the story between the main couple to be a bit lagging. Wish they took the route of the younger sister forgiving her older sister, and being supportive a lot earlier in the series, maybe at episode 7. The love romance felt a bit rushed at the end.I liked that their were multiple storylines, and more character development occurred. But sometimes it became a bit slow and some scenes were just unnecessary, especially during the last 3 episodes.All in all, the series is a like a luxury indulgence, something to treat yourself to once in a while...",9
Brilliant,"OK it not like the book..... Not everyone can read a book.
I have never read the book or normally watch series like this one.... but thought I would give it a go.
I couldn't stop watching it I had to watch the whole season in one go.
For my first time in this type of series I thought it was brilliant and really hope there is more to come, because I would watch more.",9
great show!,Great show! I'd recommend this to anyone! Talk about a real winner.,9
I loved this show!!!,"I am not one to ever write about stuff I watch but this show had me so amazed I'm ready to re-watch it again. Seriously I will not spoil anything but this is a must watch!!!! 50 shades of grey doesn't hold a candle to the ""scenes"" in this show. I only pray a season 2 is already in the works.",10
Ignore the critics,"These bad reviews are ridiculous. The show was amazing. I needed a new historical drama after finishing Outlander and this was so entertaining. I enjoyed every single episode. Give it a try, you won't regret it.",10
Are we watching the same season with different actors?,"The two people who romantically find each other, insult each other while trying to make each other jealous (even if it involves the ""loved"" sisiter), while being secretary madly inlove. Yawn.",1
LOVE IT,"Hey you ;) I don't what this fuss is all about. I absolutely loved it. I do love Jane Austen & it cannot beat her, but only because I don not compare the. This show is absolutely stunning in its own way. The actress is WOW and the actor is even more WOW. So please....watch it!!",10
Entertaining,"I enjoyed this series. I see some reviews referencing the inaccuracies of this era, but this series is not supposed to be a documentary. This is a fantasy and the setting just happens to be the 1800's.. if you like quirky romance novels, then you will like this series. I don't watch much tv, and I watched this in 2 days :-)",9
Yummy and gloriously refreshing,"Just watched the first season in 2 very late nights. That push and pull romance that keeps you wanting more. Ignore the bad reviews. This is an intriguing show, not a Scandal, but fun and romantic and serious. A little predictable here and there, but who cares. It's visually beautiful, Reje-Jean Page, mmmhmmm, can't take my eyes off him. And those trying to compare this to the real world of the period and black and white, that was never intended. Not everything has to be black and/or white. This is fiction and entertainment. Just watch and enjoy the characters and the story.",10
Fabulous Fare,"Firstly, I don't usually enjoy romance as a genre and regency romance is my least favourite type of romance.Secondly, the actors who should have held me in their sway were largely unfamiliar so I wasn't coaxed in by a familiar face ...or any other part of anatomy.Friends with a sense of humour and a sense of taste told me I would enjoy Bridgerton but it wasn't suitable to iron to (not an issue - I don't iron - I shake the clothes vigorously instead).I adored the first series and then adored the second all the more- I'm working upto Queen Charlotte because I feel I've cried enough recently.It's not a family watch but I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys being lifted out of our less than sumptuous world; the acting and scripts are spot on and the use of music inspired?",10
Woah Season 2 is FIRE,"I will be frank with everyone. Season 1 was okay. Even though i did like some of the woman rights issues they dealt with, the chemistry between the leads was a little lacking and the sex scenes were nearing soft porn.However season two is leagues better when it comes to chemistry! Jonathan Bailey and Simone Ashley had the most amazing chemistry I've ever seen on television! Also the psychological burn was so much better! The obstacles were unusual for a love triangle with so many twists and turns that keeps you at the edge of your seat right to the end of the eighth episode. They chose to go the more complicated path where all three involved had high stakes in losing the love they built with each other, especially between the sisters. Usually love triangles involves sabotage schemes...but here the schemes are all done for the love of family. So bloody refreshing.I think moving on every season will have its on flavour depending on which sibling they will cover next. I honestly can't wait for Eloise's season! That is sure to be hilarious!! But I definitely do love Anthony's (Jonathan Bailey) flavour this season; the portrayal of his emotional struggle regarding the death if his father and being torn between love an duty is equally hilarious and heartbreaking all at once. All signs of a great actor. Love love love is all I have left to say about season 2!!! WATCH IT.",9
Pure non sense,"Poor acting, no story and same old BS political drama to nothing original,
Total waste of time and I couldn't even complete entire season 1 .If i could i would rate 0 stars.",1
Silly sweet candy,"I'm loving the series so far! It'a supposed to be like gossip girl set in the regency era, and it's not supposed to be serious! Have fun, get lost in the fun. I read the books in my twenties and they were all silly and frothy. I mean how many dukes and duchesses and royalty were there for the characters to fall in love with?
My only problem... is that I wish Daphne was more like the character I imagined in the book. But still great show! And man the actor playing Simon is so handsome! This is a must watch!",9
Absolute Quality!,"I have to highly recommend BRIDGERTON. It is riveting, racy and very sexy! It has incredible actors and characters. There are a number of of the main Bridgerton family who are magnificent!You will be on the edge of your seat! Don't miss it.And do ignore any bad reviews. It's odd they exist especially when you see that it's globally popular",10
Definite must watch!,Please don't judge this on one or two episodes please watch the whole series. The reason I say this is because people have said they only watched one or two episodes DUH!There are 8 to find out the story and fall in love with the characters! There are some amazing actors! Their performance are SO convincing.Fantastic production! And of course anything that comes from Netflix HAS to be brilliant! as does anything from Shonda Rhymes.,10
Cool Story Without Pretentiousness,"I love the show! It's a welcome change from the typical royal family, uptight conversations. It is a fictional piece and I thank the creators for having beautiful people of all races included in major rolls. Does this make the show or break the show? Absolutely not! Do the modern songs played(on strings) in this period make or break it? No! Who the hell cares.. move on. Great show!
Ignore the 1 & 2 stars that may drop this one below a 7.8.",9
Enjoyable and Captivating,"As I started watching the Series, I began getting acquainted with the Characters and the Storyline. I must admit I was alway waiting to see more! As all the Episodes began to expand the lives of this Family, The Eldest Daughters search for a Suitable Match and her hope of love included in it Bridgerton indeed was Interesting and Surprising how the writers came to put forth interest to see if the path started by the Characters would play out the way they were expected to go or if they would indeed have another way to bring a fresh light on the situations! I really enjoyed the First season as I would hope for more episodes to come in the near future! This was a Show by happenstance I began watching and by choice saw it straight through, with a few breaks of course, till the last of the last episode! As I'm unsure on production dates and unsure when it was tape I'm not sure if We will see more, but I certainly hope to See a lot More of The Bridgerton Family, Their Friends and Foes and what happens in there lives!",10
Mediocre Regency period fanfic,"A sloppy series, with several historical flaws, psychologically superficial dialogues are extremely poor. A cheap melodrama inspired by a mediocre book collection.This series failed to give a good portrayal of English society in the Regency period and to develop a relationship in a credible way. It looks more like a soap opera.",1
Frothy fun,"Gossip Girl set in Regency England. Might be your thing or it might not. Personally I loved it. Just don't expect anything close to Austen- this is not in the least bit historically accurate but it's great fun if you appreciate it for what it is, gloriously trashy escapism.",9
Light and romantic love story (stories).,"I saw many negative comments. Ok this is not an historical series, but will bring you into a romantic atmosphere. Nothing to do with Jane Austen. She's my favorite writer, and I saw many people trying to compare with Pride&Prejudice or other Austen stories.
Please, watch this series as it is: different love stories some romantic and others less, without the aim of being a precise window on an historical period.
Actors: Phoebe is delicious and Rege Jean has a wonderful voice (please watch it in original language).",8
So good I watched it twice!,"The cast is brilliant, like really brilliant! I had a few favorites who made me laugh won't give away anything in case you haven't watched! Good story, love the diversity and equality! Well done to those who made this happenActing on another level, you really feel the chemistry!A bit of a masterpiece!",10
Hot!,You better kick on the air for this season. It's a sizzler! Just loved it. I adored the first season and never expected to be so into season 2. My favorite! It's that good!,10
Historical fiction at its finest!!,"Thank you Shonda Rhimes for your exquisite talents! The writing, the wit, and casting was well done! You gave a modern take on the period drama. Mere morals are not worthy.",10
"Odd mix of teen soap opera, 'costume' drama and smut","This one is a right old mess. Take pretty people, put them in fancy pretend costumes, give them a teen soap opera storyline and get them to bang each other. Costumes do not necessarily make a series highbrow or bestow any quality, especially when they have all the historical authenticity of a Klingon outfit. You need great writing and actors for that. A polished, glittery stool, albeit one that is cynically aimed at a subsection of the market that apparently loves devouring such matter.",1
This is the most gorgeous Duke ever.....His smile is mesmerizing!!!!!!!,"I have never read the books. I was skeptical when I saw the unusual casting but I gave it try because the Duke is very handsome. And it was awesome. I didn't like the weird casting of ""Cursed"" but this one is perfect. Forget about colors, history and races just look at the beauty of everything and enjoy.",10
Excellent,"They attempt to show society as it would be if it were free of bias and encouraging female empowerment. It is an exercise to show that racial inclusion would not be offensive or lead to societal breakdown. With all the complaints, the experiment has failed for some. I personally enjoyed it immensely.",10
Love it,"I've been up late for hours binge watching this show but I have to stop at episode 7 and have some sleep.
I love the characters and the diversity. If only life was really as accepting of everyone as it is in this show. At first I was confused and thought this is not how it was back then, it's hardly like it now sadly, but then I didn't care that it wasn't following with accuracy. I just loved the characters and their stories. Characters I thought I wouldn't like I do and characters I thought I would like I think are terrible self serving people.
I don't know the books, have never heard of it before so I went in with no expectations and so probably no disappointments. I would recommend this but I guess if you love the books you are probably going to be disappointed from what I've read from others.",8
Fun!,Super fun and exciting show with intrigue. The characters are all well done and I love the brightness and colours in the show. The broad and diverse cast is amazing. Would love some lgbt characters though!!,10
Excellent,What a series. Has everything!!! Sit back and enjoy every second,10
Trash TV show with shoddy regency era clothing,"I don't see how ANYONE could think this should have been nominated for Golden Globes. Seriously, the details and accuracy to regency era is complete s*it and don't even start me on the literal soft p*rn they put in almost each episode.
While funny and cringe worthy at best, it gives off a trash TV vibe, similar to Hallmark and Netflix's Christmas movies.Only good thing about this whole show is the soft p*rn.I fail to understand how you could pick up a regency era romance book with 3.5/5 stars(that's before people who didn't read the books but saw the show, flooded it with 5 stars) and make a show out of it. What blackmail does the author have on Netflix and Shondaland (how cringey is the name)?",4
Lovely,"Beautiful story, cinematography, and cast. Definitely recommend.",10
A perfect fantasy!,"It is as good as I expected from the trailer. I have waited for a few months and I didn't regret it at all. One thing that I don't like is just it is come to an end-I demand for the second season to come next year!! I have finished it in one sitting because the very first episode has captured me perfectly! Oh, and also, Rage-Jèan is my new obsession for the whole month!!!",8
A beautiful and lovely storyplay,Wonderful and lovely story play. the duke and duchess actors doing it quite well. definitely renewable to 4/5 seasons. Loved it,9
Out of the box 👏 Well done!,"This is a very good start to what I hope will be a very long series.
As a book lover I couldn't be happier.
I'm sad to see the bad reviews; people must keep in mind that this is fiction, and it is a very good production.
Congratulations to all the professionals involved, I think you are on the right path, please don't let the negative reviews throw you down. All the book clubs that I belong to, absolutely loved it.
Don't keep us waiting long for the second season.",9
Intriguing and Excellently rendered show,"I had heard much talk about this show and had put it on my list to give it a look-see when I had the time to do so. Have to say, I was not disappointed. I found the stories and performances intriguing, the depth of the thespian's portrayals drawing me into their stories so that I was invested in the outcomes. I found the show to be such a delight, that I am now interested in reading the books upon which it us based. Well done!!!",9
Love it! (Minus a few parts),"I love the show. It's a spiced up regency era drama series that I think Jane Austen herself would find amusing. But would she be equally as appalled at the continued sex scenes? I found myself cringing at the Granville house 'parties'. Not exactly something I expected.
Other than the unnecessary amount of sex thrown in, it's a good show. I do hope for a second series. C'mon Netflix and etc, don't let us fans down.",8
SO GOOD!,"I really enjoyed this show a lot. I did not read the books and I do not usually enjoy period tv shows or movies, but I was hooked on this show. From episode one I was invested in the characters, and each episode kept me on the edge of my seat. The costumes were amazing, I loved everything. The scenery and photography was spectacular. I found myself crying toward the end, it really was a beautiful love story and very well done. I was happy to see such a diverse cast represented as well.",9
Loved it,"I have no idea if this was historically correct or not (ignoring the obvious diversity in the casting, which I loved) and I didn't care one way or the other. I'm sure if you watch a program like this it is because you like romance, and for me, the main recipe for making this brilliant, was the casting. The chemistry between all the actors was fantastic, the pacing of the episodes kept me hooked and I can't wait for the next series.",9
Pride and Prejudice + Downton Abbey = Bridgerton,"You'll find many nods to Jane Austin in both expressions and situations. Thoroughly entertaining. Binged it in a single day. Not terribly original, but that's ok because I love how many balls they attend, the costumes, the characters....all of it.",9
"Binge, Binge, Binge!","This show is flashy and ridiculous but just enjoyable to watch!
I love the characters, the costumes are amazing and the acting is great! If you're looking for historical accuracy, this show will not be for you. If you enjoy a good story, lovely but complex characters, definitely give it a watch. Just leave all expectations at the door, and I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy yourself.
I binged the whole first season and I freakin loved it. I'm sure it's not for everyone, at times, I found it very clichéd, sometimes cringey even ;) but come on, it's a period drama! It's not a damn documentary that has to be historically accurate. It has great humor in it, too!Suffice to say, it's my new guilty pleasure.Looking forward to season 2.",8
I hated season 2,I thought season one was quite good once you got over that it had no historical accuracy. But if watched purly as fiction ity was entertaining. Season 2 was just awfull. I didnt even bother with watching the last episodes because it just butchered the book and I hated it . I loved the book by the way and the main reason I stopped watching season 2 was that I didnt want to ruin the book any more than I already had so I couldnt read it again.,1
Worth watching,"It's fiction so don't expect it to be historically accurate. They never intended it to be. Don't expect it to be exactly like the book. It's based on the book not an exact replica. For me the show adaptations: diversity, music, characters, made it much more interesting than the book. My advice would be to give it a try with an open mind. People given it scores of 1 to 3 are obviously not even taking into account the fabulous costume and setting design. Those reviews read like what a petulant child would write. It may end up not being your cup of tea but rubbish it is not. Grow up people!",8
Watched it all in a day,"This show is literally Gossip girl in upper class 1800s England, and somehow they managed to make it work. I was actually interested in the show from beginning to end. Very, very interesting show.",10
Binge worthy!,"Absolutely loved it and the contemporary edge made it for me...fully invested in the characters, the music, the costumes and the romance. Can't wait for the next series!",10
OMG,"What can I say bridgerton season 3 so worth the wait - I've watched all 4 episodes of season 3 so far in the uk which were absolutely brilliant.Colin and Penelope what a combination, another great start to the season,I'm loving how the series is sharing stories of various couples which will no doubt link in to the seasons that are due to follow.What a transformation of Penelope she has definitely come out of the shadows / corner, both Colin & Penelope realising that they are in love with each other is beautiful, mesmerising - roll on for June 2024 and the remaining 4 episodes, I can't wait and I'm sure they won't disappoint.",10
Fantasy,"A great escape. Romantic. Sexy. If you take yourself too seriously you might not like this. No it's historically accurate on all accounts but who cares. If you like to occasionally watch something that takes your mind away from the current woes of our world, you'll love it. Strong female characters. I loved it.",10
Snooze fest!!,"Season 2 was beyond annoying and predictable. Couldn't even finish episode 3. The dance between Kate (who was entirely overly pretentious, rude, and flat out annoying) and Anthony was miserable. I think I'd hate my sister if she was Kate and even worse, it wasn't love. Just some played out fetish on falling for the person you initially disliked the most. What a huge disappointment.",1
an interesting perspective,"Why not?At the beginning I saved this title on my favorite list and to watch it some times.... but than one day I told myself it is time.It is a good one, the diversity is fantastic and the vision of putting in place all the cast is really great. We are living in an interesting time of period and our thinking must be more open, this is also a message of the movie ''think open and say the things as they are because only in this way problems can be solved and''.I saw it already two times.",10
Entertaining,As an avid reader I read this series through the years as they were published. It was a favorite. A screen play will never be exactly the same as the book from which it was made. With that in mind I was able to fully enjoy the series as its own and I was not disappointed. Thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining and I'm hoping for a second season.,9
This is NOT supposed to be historically accurate!!,"I think a lot of people do not like this series because they disagree with its modern societal acceptance in a period piece. I think, if you have an open mind, you could really get into a show like this. When I heard about it I wasn't sure what to expect, but honestly I really enjoyed it and binge-watched the whole first season! It reminds me of gossip girl and a mild Game of Thrones mixed together. It is pure magic, fantasy and I get lost in it every time I watch. Totally recommend!",8
Fun and entertaining,"I don't get all the bad reviews. Everyone saying it is not historically accurate. It's fiction. I found it entertaining, colorful, and fun. The characters were interesting and attractive. I have really enjoyed the series and look forward to a second series.",9
season 2 is better,"I rated the first season 6, but the second one is better, now I gave it a 7.More passionate because of the desire, although the erotics is much less compared to season 1, the music is perfect as always.",8
Loved every scandalous minute of this show.,"Absolutely loved Bridgerton! This adaptation from Julia Quinn's series was more than I could have hoped for. I have read every book in this series and loved how it was brought to life with some details I didn't even know it needed. I loved the diverse cast, the costumes, setting, music, just everything! All the actors were cast beautifully and I really enjoyed watching this series. I can't wait for season 2.",10
"Oh yes, very happy with Bridgerton","Great production!! I'm always unsure when books I like or love are translated to screen. I read every genre but still have a soft spot for my Georgette Heyer, Austen and other good regency romance writers. Bridgerton is very well done and I want the rest now. I'm very happy with the, A Knights Tale style slightly modern/different take with regard to music, dancing and costumes. The wit and humour of the books is not coming across but that may not be a priority for this production. Even so I'm sticking with my 10 star rating.
I'm already watching it over again and have new Bridgerton converts in the family. The proof was when I asked on Christmas Day did they mind if I watched the first episode just to satisfy my craving and then we could do whatever else they wanted. They then insisted on watching the lot! Never did that before.
I also liked that they used actors of colour to portray some aristocratic families or servants just the way it could have been if not for slavery or prejudice. Very interesting.
Thank you Netflix!! Thank you Shondraland!! Second series please!!!",10
"Watch this for raucous, scandal-filled fun!!","I expected people to be very upset about the diverse casting, and so many reviews comment on that rather than the actual show. Full disclosure I would've given this 8 stars but added one to balance out the exaggerated one-star reviews.I'm a huge Downton fan so I leaped at the chance to check out this show. I also liked Sanditon which was lighter and more saccharine.I binged the entire season of Bridgerton in one night, and am totally not sorry. My standard is whether I enjoyed the show and felt it worthy of the time spent watching. Yes, and Yes!I love period pieces, but also know Shonda Rhimes takes no prisoners where drama is concerned. I was not disappointed!Of course some of the plot is thin and characters fun but predictable archetypes. But that's also every Jane Austen novel! There are few revelations that can't be predicted based on similar shows and tropes. The Featherton family = a twist on Cinderella with evil stepmother and ugly stepsisters. Daphne and Simon = Beauty and the Beast etcBut boy did I love watching every episode. Lot's of imho over-the-top ""love"" scenes meant to be salacious and graphic but sometimes made me giggle due to the exaggeration.I loved all the bright and often garish costuming which was as much a part the characters as anything else. Lots of candy colors, rich blues, purples and pops of red. It was a visual feast!I thoroughly enjoyed this very fun and escapist show, and found it refreshing to see black people in period garb just living like everyone else and NOT discussing race. I didn't know I needed this show, but turns out I need more like this!Get your girlfriends together and watch!",9
On my 3rd go around!,"I absolutely love the show! From the costumes, to the music, to the chemistry between the actors, the show is awesome!!!",9
A perfect 10! Cried in happiness so much.,"Well this TV series really turned on my tears, the plot twists kept me on edge and the gossip was amazing and historically King George Was losing his mind unfortunately, every family was struggling and no one had a perfect family. What an amazing diversity in the cast although this diversity did not exist in England it felt good that it existed here in this series.",10
Took a fun charming story and made it miserable,"Loathed season 2. Made Anthony into a jerk, Edwina into an idiot, left out the positive relationship between Kate and her stepmother out almost completely. In the books there was a loving and positive sister bond as a key point in the story. Edwina knew Kate and Anthony were in love and the ridiculous wedding scene between Edwina and Anthony had no place occurring at all.The Brigerton books had charm and laughter, this adaptation has neither. The costumes, colourblind casting and locations are the only redeeming features.Why adapt a romance novel and make the characters less likeable. Unlikely to continue with the series if they can't include the fun and laughter from the source material.",3
So well done.,"I am a huge reader of romance and was extremely excited that this series of books was being made into a series.
I loved this show from the opening sequence. The vibrant colors, the people milling about, balls, the season. All of it.
I did not give it full marks because I felt the chemistry between this seasons couple was lacking.
I hope the success of this series helps other romance novels be made into series as well.",9
Entertaining and fun,"I have not read the book series so I watched this with no expectations, and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was - entertainment! It is not a historical documentary and that's the beauty of it. It is historical FICTION for the modern audience; it is make believe - a world where there was racial diversity amongst the most elite in society (and it's all the better for it). I have absolutely no problem with switching off from the nightmare of 2020 and, instead, watching beautiful people (in beautiful costumes) entertain me for a while. It is definitely no Jane Austen or Brontë - but that's a good thing. Those are the classics and will always remain so. This is a lavish and modern spin on the genre. I thought that all the cast and crew did a fantastic job and I'm looking forward to more escapism with the next season.",10
Great take on the books,"This is a great show - funny, silly, basically Gossip Girl in the 1800s! It's mainly based on the first book but dips in and out of the others and adds a few new characters.If anyone is complaining about the diversity of the cast and it being 'inconsistent' with the period, then their racism is fully showing. The show makes use of modern songs, amongst other things inconsistent with the time period, yet no one cares about that...I can only assume this is because they don't actually care about accuracy and just want an excuse to vent their racism. I suggest they take a long, hard look at themselves and why it bothers them so much.",8
The Incredible Season 2!,"Loved Season 2!! Romantic, amusing, with back stories that explain character motives. The personalities of the new women characters in this season were engaging, as was the plot. Tension galore! And if you like horses, this season is for you!",10
Absolute delight,Not sure why it has less stars on IMDb. Didn't even felt like checking reason but I was hooked to it :) It's a period drama and beautifully made. I didn't like Daphne overly innocent character though . She reminded me of 50 shades of grey main lead. Also the her wardrobe so sooo dull.,9
50/50,"Season 1 was brilliant, I really enjoyed it. I loved the characters and the story line. I couldn't wait to watch season 2........
Season 2 was dull & boring. I didn't enjoy the new characters especially the Sharma family, they were dull & predictable. Such a disappointment.I'm hoping season 3 revives my love for the show... I'll just sweep season 2 aside and pretend it didn't happen :)",5
Gossip girl in the 1800's,"Light, a suited finally for a first season,
A great history, and some twist's were unexpected, at least, the identity off Whistledown itself was left a totally mystery to the very end.",9
Unique Masterpiece!!!,"Just finished the whole of season 1. One of the most beautiful things I have watched!! Look out for some awards ;)The cast was very well chosen! Really great acting, everyone worked so well with each other. The script/writing amazing! The ladies costumes are to die for, they are so well designed and so delicate!Everything about the series is incredible! It's no wonder it's so popular ALL over the worldWell done Netflix, you just don't get anything wrong!.Looking forward to Season 2",10
don't take it to seriously,"If you like historical correctness in a show this one isn't for you. however if you want to get away from reality for an afternoon and like a bit of gossipy romance I deffinitly reccoment it.
It looks stunning, the acting is good and the characters are well develloped. the multible stories are a bit predictable but I gess that belongs to the genre.
Don't go in this expecting a trilling show. Just get yourself cuddled up on your couch with some thee and enjoy",9
Outside the box original! That's why it's a number one show!!,"First of all please ignore ANY negativity.. soundtrack alone Is worth watching the series for! Actors are amazing! There is humor, scandal, teary moments and the storyline keeps you engaged.This is not your typical historical drama and that's a good thing, so don't bother comparing it! It's unique and VERY inclusive!! which is what people are not noticing! So well done to the casting companyTerrific performances from just about everyone. I recommend this show if you are looking for something a bit different",10
Brilliant,"Best love story, only got 1 more episode to watch, I'm totally in Love with it. Hope they making a second & more.
The only criticism I have is the ONE reference to racism, so far, It didn't need it. It just took you back to today's horrendous world. But apart from that it's a beautiful story. If only we could all live in a world like that.",10
Awful,"I barely got through first 2 episodes, it's a disaster. Writing, acting, everything. It reminds me of Mexican soaps. Although it's more boring lol How this show has a rating 7.3 I will never understand. I gave it 2* just because I can use it as a background noise for sleeping.",2
Wonderful show!,Unloved this show I watched the entire season in two days ! Simply marvelous,10
Loved it,Really enjoyed it watched the whole season in one setting Hope there's a season two😁,10
"Beware, your racism is showing","Lovely romantic period piece that was never meant to be a history lesson. It lightly delves into the absurdities of propriety that still plague our culture today, while elucidating the struggles of women, poc, and LGBTQIA, both in history and our current culture. These topics are just barely touched upon, and instead are illuminated through an entertaining and romantic filter. For those of you who are cringing and complaining about the historic inaccuracies of having poc in starring roles, I would warn you that your racism is showing. This was was never meant as a historically accurate piece (with its larger than life fashion, music and society); if your problem with this series are the poc, then I would suggest your problem does not lie with historical accuracy but instead with deep seeded racism and the advancement of poc within our society. Otherwise you would also be crying that ""Thank you next"" by Ariana Grande was playing at the ball.",10
Worth a watch!,"I highly recommend giving Bridgerton a watch especially if you like romantic dramas. It's a lavish delight of a drama in a opulent setting. It's important you don't expect the subtlety of Austen - yes, this is a Georgian era romance but written and then adapted for a modern audience - but in simplest terms, smash Austen with Gossip Girl and you get Bridgerton.So yes I've read all of Julia Quinn's books and love the Brigderton family. Is this the same? No. Is it therefore bad? Also no. I just do what I do with every other TV show/movie of books I love and compartmentalise them into separate things. The characters are somewhat different from their book selves, but from what you can see from the first season, it allows greater character development to occur that is more fit for the TV screen. I loved the inconclusion of Marina, a minor character from the 5th book in the series based on Eloise story, it added extra depth to the series.I have a history degree and read voraciously so yes, I'm aware of the historical inaccuracies. However, I'm also aware this is a work of fiction, a delightful romp through a somewhat Georgian period of English history with marriage minded mamas and men trying to avoid the parson's trap. I'm not watching this looking for a history lesson, and if you are you're doing life wrong.The use of POC actors is vaguely explained with a comment partway through the series to do with the King falling for a POC and marrying her, thus making way for an inclusive society, but to be honest I don't think it was necessary. The best people for the roles have them. Despite comments on the woodenness of acting, I think the casting is great, particularly Adjoa Andoh for the society matriarch, Lady Danbury, Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherton, and Regé-Jean Page as Simon Bassett, The Duke of Hastings. The actors do a great job of injecting life into the script.The only character I was unsure about the changes for was Daphne - she is younger in the show than in the books, in her first season rather than her second. I think some of Daphne's depth is lost due to this. Book Daphne was beautiful but men quickly saw her as a friend (something to do with growing up in the country with 3 older brothers and being particularly close to Colin, her closest in age). She wasn't desperate to marry and indeed new she didn't have to (the Bridgerton Viscountancy wad thriving and if any daughters chose not to marry they would always be supported) but did want children, thus concocted a scheme with Simon to have her seem more desirable. Turning her into someone who cares about not much more than making the best match does the witty, gracious character from the books a huge disservice, losing some of her close relationship with her older brothers too. I feel like her character is the only real change from the book that I take issue with. Hopefully they can keep a little more true to the essence of the Brigderton family characters for any additional series and their own stories.",8
Good show :),"Overally, I really enjoyed this show. I binged it in like, two days (I have a toddler, otherwise it would have been in one day) and was thoroughly upset when it was done.Some of the intimate scenes are a little... Intimate (lol), but the plot, characters, acting etc are all really good.The cast plays really well together and I truly felt as though I was in this.I would recommend but if you are shy with intimate scenes, beware and have your fast forward ready :p",8
Please tell me no one takes this seriously. Please.,"I really hope I'm missing some big trick here and no one is genuinely taking this seriously. Please tell me for my own sanity that viewers at least realise it's absolute trash, as either a romance or a drama, but go along with it for the pompous, costume-y ride?Historical accuracy is out of the window, but as it is fiction, that's fine. But woe be all of us if our media consumption returns to the 'boobs and swords' era of the late noughties that this series mind-numbingly revitalises.The age rating certification given to this (15) actually surprised me, mainly due to the fact that anyone of viewing age or above shouldn't find anything contained in it as exciting, novel, shocking, nor interesting.Sniff.",2
"Excellent, entralling","I started watching this series with moderate interest only to become enthralled with the story line and characters. The personalities were very well done as well as the wardrobe, with some creative liberties, for the era. I loved all the twists and turns in the story as well as how their struggles within were portrayed. The intimate moments with the lead characters were in the looks but the magical moment showed up in their first dance and was reinforced with their last dance. There are a few spirited surprises, so heads up. Whoever came up with the hair creations for the Queen I applaud you for your creativity as they are works of art. I, as well as several people who have watched it found it very entertaining to watch and are eagerly waiting for season 2, which can not come soon enough. Congratulations to cast and crew for an excellent job.I gave this a 9 because of some of the wardrobe on the mother with the 3 girls. It was a little over the top with the garrish fabrics. I get what was trying to be portrayed but it could be toned down a bit and still get your point across.",9
Simply wonderful,"I really like the book series and this first Netflix season (book # 1) does justice to the feeling of reading them. Romantic, beautiful, sweet moment, funny dialogues and heartwarming about a delightful family. Nicely done, genuine romance feeling and a big: I like. Looking forward to more.",8
"I need more like this, please.","Not great, but very good. I binged all episodes on Xmas day. I will watch this series again. Please give me more adaptions of romance/romantic science fiction please. The well to choose from is very deep.",8
Not related to the book though,"It is based on the series of books by Julia Quin , but apparently it's got nothing to do with the books, even though i found enjoyable the drama the romance the outfits were amazing, the decorations.
I recommend for romance lovers.",8
A glow up on Regency romances,"I read this book many years ago and can see why Julia Quinn's series would be made into a TV series. I am glad it has been developed a bit more as times have changed and character backstories have more depth. It's like the easy beach reads have had a 'Chilling Adventures of Sabrina' glow up. I have no issue with the diverse actors used, as they all act well, and the female characters while understanding their role in life (making good marriage connections and producing heirs), they mostly understand and strive for more. I like the use of modern music, dances and costuming, which together make the series feel modern. The broody rake-ish type is a bit repetitive and yet we still love that (plus Regé-Jean Page gets topless). Stand outs are Adjoa Andoh (Lady Danbury),Nicola Coughlan (Penelope) and Claudia Jessie (Eloise) are brilliant too",8
Wooden acting from Kate,"I really love the concept of this show, with race being a non-issue like it should have been in this world. It looks amazing seeing the scenes and cast. S2 Anthony was really good, he is clearly a very talented actor. Unfortunately Kate ruined it for me. I found her acting so wooden and cringe, it made me laugh at points and totally ruined scenes. It did not match the depth of Jonathan Bailey's acting.",4
I enjoyed every minute of it,"I decided to take the time to write a review as I was surprised and shocked by all the bad reviews I've just read! I absolutely loved this series!
Maybe I'm lucky that I don't know much about history. I didn't even consider it to be linked to real history. It was a just a story in a different world.
I think all actors were great and I loved the tension between the people in love and that the love scenes weren't just cut or not shown.
I really got into the story and enjoyed every minute of it until the end. It was difficult to switch off after an episode as I needed to know what was going to happen next.
I also enjoyed to look at the beautiful dresses and clothes.
I haven't read the book and didn't have any expectations when I started watching. Maybe that's the best way. I highly recommend it.",10
"Perfect combination of pride and prejudice, fifty shades of grey and gossip girl","Yes, it is a show, not more, but I enjoyed every piece of it. I didn't read the books so had no expectations. But I loved the story, I loved the diversity in the cast, the utopian fantasy of having people of colour occupying high ranks at those times for me was genius, if only we could change the past... Very entertaining, just what I needed for a relaxing sunday while my husband watched his football.",8
As if Gossip Girl took place in a parallel universe where upper class England was diverse and had Maroon 5 songs,"I can understand the criticism, it's not even close to being historically accurate, but the historical vibe is present, and it adds a fun aspect to an otherwise teen drama, I also do enjoy their versions of modern songs.There is some social commentary about misogyny and class, race issues are ignored, which I kind of like because it lets us see actors that we might not have otherwise seen in those type of roles.The cast is very attractive, the casting, customer and acting are excellent, most of the characters are three dimensional and the story is interesting.",8
Delightful,"I don't understand the negative reviews here. Sure,this is silly and trivial, but it's FUN. The writing is excellent, production values are first rate, character development is top notch and the acting leaves nothing to be desired. It's Jane Austen with saucy bits. What's not to like?",8
"Beautiful, magical adaptation",Everything from the cast to the costumes to the plot was just wonderful! Things are always bound to change in adaptations and in this case for the better. Casting for Simon and Lady Danbury in particular were marvelous choices! I am so very glad this show has been created and look forward to seeing many more seasons to come that will depict all the other Bridgerton books!!,10
Downton Abbey with a hangover,"This is a teen approach to a period drama. Or maybe an American approach, it matter. The fact is that many of the main characters are not well casted. Some of them would be perfect choices for EastEnders or Coronation Street, but not for a period drama. Really, it reminds me of the typical High School American series, but set in the 19th century. The behaviour of the characters is not credible, to put is simply. The plot, such a cliché. When I heard Ariadna Grande and Maroon 5 in the background, played by violins, I couldn't stand more of it. Preposterous. Not credible at all. And Julie Andrews voiceover as if all of it was Wisteria Lane. I needed a G&T after approximately 25 min of it. If I watch the full series I would become an alcoholic.",2
"If you are a fan of period dramas and romance novels, this is a must watch!!","I'm a huge fan of period dramas, I've watched all tv and film adaptations of Jane Austen's novels and other classic period pieces, so when I heard about a new show set in regency England, I knew I had to watch.Years ago, I also read the book series by Julia Quinn on which this series is based, and even if I don't remember everything, this has always been my favorite of the lot and the one I remember the most.While not exactly the same, I believe this is a very faithful adaptation, at least in spirit, and I loved every second of it! The actors, the costumes, the sets, the music everything was excellent and vibrant. Indeed, this series, reminded me of the movie Emma, which came out last year, and was a more modern, racier adaptation of the beloved Austen classic. I appreciate the use of a diverse cast, and don't understand what the fuss is about really. All the actors were great (particularly the actress playing Lady Danbury), and now, I can't imagine reading the books again without picturing them in my mind. I really hope they continue adapting the other books too!In conclusion, this was a beautiful, sweet, funny, sexy show, that I highly recommend to all the fans of period dramas and books. Forget about historical accuracy and just enjoy the show for what it is, you will not regret it!",10
In every way a very good serie!,"I really enjoyed this serie! Great acting, a great story....never a dull moment. A story told with humor, depth and warmth for all the caracters.",9
For those uninformed- this is based on a very popular book series,"A FICTIONAL book series.... Complaints about inaccuracy, too much sex and more are so ridiculous as it's FICTION.... Not a freaking documentary and they are following at least partially the book series .... Wowsa some of these reviews are preposterous..My take- it's not perfect there is an air of cheesiness but I thought some actors were amazing others were questionable but it did not affect the plot or anything. The diversity of the cast of characters is refreshing even if historically inaccurate... they discuss it, explain it and give it reason. Sometimes shows try this and act as if the characters are not diverse as if the watcher should imagine there are no differences.... However this show discusses it rather plainly and I like it being addressed. Plus any show that celebrates diversity I'm willing to try - doesn't mean I or anyone will like them all but supporting those productions helps to ensure there will be more.",8
Just Wonderful!,"This is such a great show! The best I've seen this Christmas season. Shonda Rhimes certainly knows how to tell a great story. The cast is fantastic. Rege-Jean Page is to die for, and the chemistry between he and Daphne is perfect. I've seen some reviews that say the show is shallow, pretty but insubstantial. And I haven't seen anyone mention where the real substance comes from. It's the unbelievable situation of the women of the times. They didn't know how babies were made? Incredible! They had no idea what happened on their wedding night? Ludicrous! This is as feminist a story as Shonda has ever told.I was actually brought to tears when Daphne told her sister Eloise that she believed she would make her own way in the world. It's so sad, to me, that we have been kept down for so very long. I applaud Ms Rhimes and her excellent producer, Chris Van Dusen, for giving us a beautiful, light-hearted comedy/drama that also speaks out on female disenfranchisement. Bravo!!",10
Season 1 give sex & Season 2 romance,An absolutely exceptional season that opens up the world of Bridgerton to greater explore the family history and dynamics along with the towns people. The addition of Kate and Edwina Sharma only create a fresh story that plays out in beautiful and dramatic fashion. Most especially Simone Ashley and Jonathan Bailey as Kate and Anthony give a new definition to chemistry and the slow burn that pays off in the end. They are exquisite together and absolutely mesmerizing. This is a must watch for fans!,10
Where are the Bridgertons I know and love?,"If Shonda Rhimes, Chris Van Dusen, or whoever was responsible this series wanted to write a fictional regency love story that covered race, class and any other issue that plagues us in 2020, then they should have made up something of their own. Instead they took a wonderful series with such lovely characters and storylines and ruined it. I'm on episode 5 and I recognize NO ONE and NOTHING from the novels. It's breaking my heart. Honestly, the storylines, characters and actors are just awful and I'm struggling to watch this mess. I loved the novels and I truly hate this series. I don't know if I can even finish. Just plain awful.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!",1
What a unique and emotional show!,"I cried so much and clapped my hands and squealed like a little child watching this! 🤣 We absolutely enjoyed this show. I watched it with my mom and aunt and we couldn't stop watching. We stayed up until 6am to finish it!!
I absolutely loved seeing Simon and Daphne's story unfold. Seeing their emotions and all of the drama. How fantastic! And my God, those are 2 extremely gorgeous people! 😍😍
This show brought so much emotions out, I haven't cried and laughed so much in awhile watching a show! It was just absolutely so well done. The cast was wonderful, they all played their parts so well. This is such a unique and beautiful show. It's all about humans and connections. Family, relationships, love, fears. It is truly about US. I can't wait to rewatch it and relive all of the special and intimate moments. Life is about the connections we make and the people we love. So I will never be tired of seeing shows and films that celebrate this natural part of life. I also can't wait to see what little bits I might not have noticed the first time around!!
But aside from all of that, I have to say... Eloise stole the show for me! This girl. IS. AH. MAZE. ZING!! Just wow. Like, I have no words for this girl. She has stolen my heart. ❤ I would say my top, most favorite moments were involving any of these: Eloise, Peneloise, Polin, Anthony, Penelope. And, Sir Phillip!! I lived for these moments. I also adored seeing Benedict's parts, he is wonderful and cute and funny. Him and Colin interacting was great!! 😂😍 And I loved any mention of their father, and the emotions it brought. I loved hearing any little back story from the Bridgertons, and I hope we get a TON more next season! I also totally loved seeing the bumble bee snippets. How extra! This was just so fun and so well done. If you haven't watched it, do so. There are so many ways in which people can relate to what these characters go through and deal with. It's an emotional and beautiful roller coaster.",10
"Perfect, lovely...","This series is perfect, it has a lot of representation, it was very well prepared, all the people in front and behind the cameras are to be congratulated. The work exceeded all my expectations, i look forward to the next seasons !!",10
Mid series 3 review,"Series 1. 9 stars. This series was almost perfect. I initially found the diversity a little jarring because it didn't make any sense. Regardless I got sucked in and then was provided with something of an explanation mid way thru which honestly was such a clever manoeuvre without punching you in the face with social messaging. An example of 'show me don't tell me' current programs are so horribly lacking. The love story was so entirely gripping, the characters all introduced so well, it was excellentSeries 2. 6 stars. This series was a bit of a disappointment. The female lead, Kate, was actually pretty unlikeable. She seemed unnecessarily rude, abrasive and selfish. I think the aim was her being fiercely independent, but it played out as her being a bit of a b*tch. It lost the 'show me don't tell me' because we had to repeatedly be told she's so nice, so selfless, but we never saw it. And secondly the chemistry between her and Anthony was a bit hit and miss. I ended the series unsold.Series 3. So far 8 stars. The series between Pen and Colin are excellent so far. The only downside is Anthony and Kate. I was forgiving of Kate delivering lines badly and without natural cadence the first time round. But it is like she has never read a single novel of the time period and delivers lines like a high school presentation every single time. It's actually painful. It she says Vi Count Ess one more time I might actually scream.",8
Deliciously scandalous,The casting was perfect. Simon *wink* is dreamy... it is a must watch (and read),10
I loved,"I particularly found the series fantastic, I loved the diversity of the cast, and I think this is just fiction, so it's ok to change things that didn't happen at that time. After all, the story portrays a novel and not a historical fact.",10
Pick and choose historical fact,"The first time I watched I made it through 10 minutes. It's so historically inaccurate I knew it would be too painful to continue. Then I read a piece in Oprah Magazine that said to look at it as a fantasy movie so it doesn't need to realistic. I watched again with that in mind but after making it to the fourth episode that time it occurred to me, why does it just change some of the historical fact? Why not also change gender roles? Why not change everything and they can just show the characters behaving as if they were born in 2000? How far should we take the ""fantasy?"" We can't rewrite history no matter how much the woke brigade would like to.",2
MUST WATCH!!!,Omggg... I'm in love with this show. I binge watched it in one day. I love them diverse cast and the plot. I don't want to say to much but I really hope they have a second season.,10
Couldn't love it more,Amazing show!! That's how book should be adapted. It was highly addictive and very juicy. I cannot wait for that second season!!,8
"I loved the cast, the details are excellent, I loved the diversity in the choice of actors, an incredible soundtrack","I loved the cast, the details are excellent, I loved the diversity in the choice of actors, an incredible soundtrack",10
Enchantingly beautiful and faithful to the original story,"Honestly,i don't know what i expected before actually seeing Bridgerton, but it exceeded my expectations on so many levels. I am a big fan of JQ's novels, and never have i ever before seen a world from a paper so beautifully transferred to screen. All the emotions, the casting choices, the chemistry, the humor, while keeping the soul the novel has, i am speechless and still recovering from everything i felt when watching it. This is honestly the first adaptation where i can't say i wish they'd done something differently.
If you are looking for a historically accurate story, then move along from this one. How one can pay attention to skin color next to every beautiful detail this story is interwoven with, is beside me.
Will definitely be watching many times again as i am not ready to leave this world quite yet(not sure I'll ever be).
Thank you Shonda Rhimes and Chris Van Dusen for this work of art.",10
SEASON 2 review is 7 stars,"I love an enemy to lovers romance so can't go down too hard on this season. I thought it was off to a promising start but then petered out a bit... First of all, I love the bright and lush production design and I'm a sucker for Regency fashion. Points for that! I thought the actor playing Anthony was quite good and seemed sincere but didn't tip over into soap opera land. He was quite compelling. Alas, the Miss Sharma actress could not match him. It's like she didn't know how to express herself or show nuance or archness so she's just shake her head or move her arms around. Bummer. She is beautiful!Also, didn't welcome seeing Daphne from Season 1. What a boooooring character with little charisma. Please can she go on permanent holiday? I do like the Eloise characters (is it just me or is she doing a British Emma Stone?). Colin is a stuffed shirt and I don't look forward to more of him.I liked the Bridgerton matriarch and Queen performances this season as well. I do hope the next seasons improve upon the books. I tried to read the Eloise book recently and couldn't finish it.... I like the ""commoner"" romance story for her. Also, when do we get a queer Bridgerton? Seems like Benedict was heading that way but maybe not. Perhaps two Bridgerton sibling romances could be done in one season.",8
Total mockery of the era,"I feel embarrased that the Bridgerton story would hide the truth behind this era. It is like the British version of Song of the South. I assume the producer, writers, etc want to sanitize an era of history and inequality so it is obliterated and no one will ever reflect on the lessons of history If it was entertaining, that would make it a little bearable. Obvious intent to revise history so that people forget the reality. Why do some writers think that people of color are so desperate to integrate into alternate history?? People don't deserve this level of pandering. This show probably did not need to be made at all, and if so, it should have at least been more intelligently written.",1
Fan-Fipping Tastic!!,"Are you kidding me? Ok everyone has a right to their opinion. Coloured? The only coloured people on this earth are white. We go green with envy. Red with anger, white with shock! Etc etc etc This to me was an absolutely fantastic yarn! It bugs me that there is a shameful history. No one is proud. No one is innocent. No one can erase history. And no one should try! But for goodness sake! Go with the flow and just enjoy a fantastic blooming entertaining show! This is NOT a political platform. Still shocked that COLOURED was excepted!!",8
Soapy but hey...,"Those complaining of woke historical ""inaccuracies"" should also point out that the characters should all have rotten teeth and small pox scars all over their faces- but that is ok for them???",8
I LOVE THIS SHOW!!,It is such a bingeable show!!! This show makes you care about the characters and treats them like real people!!! The set design and the locations of this show are gorgeous!!! It is so entertaining and I am so excited for season 2!!!!,8
Worth your time!,"This wonderful and romantic book series has been beautifully brought to life in the Bridgerton series! As someone who has read the books over and over again, the introduction to the Bridgerton family was so cleverly done. They took the over lapping timelines from the various books into the series and set into motion each characters personalities and laid the groundwork for their eventual love story. Daphne and Simon were played so well, whether they were flirting, fighting or tearing each other's clothes off. I laughed, cried and swooned as I binged all 8 hours in a row. I can't wait to watch it again and this was such a wonderful Christmas present (and a 2020 highlight.)",10
I loved it!,"No need to take it so SERIOUS, it's pure fun and colorful.
Yes it's not going to be a Golden Globe winner... but sometimes you just want a light and fun tv series.
Perfect for lockdown 3.",9
Disappointing,"The first season was outstanding to say the least with intricate plots and interesting character development. Anthony was definitely one of my favorites in season 1! Just watched season 2 and it honestly did not even feel like the same show. The shots were a little gimmicky at times and the lines too. I also did not like how the two main characters of the season, Kate and Anthony did not even get the proper attention they needed. As a viewer, I felt very underwhelmed and disconnected from their characters. For some reason they really gave more screen time to characters I don't care to watch.",3
"I loved everything about this show - IF YOU HAD DOUBTS, GO WATCH IT.","This series is so freaking amazing. I got the feeling as if I were in this era all through the episodes, from the costumes to then characters, the love story and just everything about it. A MUST WATCH.",9
Ignore the bad reviews!!,"This show is fabulous escapism! Exactly what we need right now. As for the bad reviews? C'mon people! This is fiction! Wonderful, delightful, gorgeous, happy fiction. Cannot wait for season 2!!!",10
Thank you Shonda Rhimes,Splendidly and beautifully shot. Costumes and acting award winning. Netflix will sweep award ceremonies. Ma Rainey and now this both of these masterpiece in the same year from the same entertainment company. Netflix is legitimately the King of Entertainment. I bringe watched entire 1 season in 24 hours. I'm bored already awaiting for season 2.,9
One of the best series on Netflix,"Well, I finished both of the seasons in 5 days (I'm very embarrassed to day that lmfao). After finishing the first season and saw that Simon was no longer part of the cast on the second, I debated whether I should even start it or not, then read lots of reviews saying it's very boring. I gave it the benefit of the doubt since the first one did not disappoint me once. But??? It literally is not boring at all???? The second season's main cast literally carried each episode and it was so good. I can't wait for the third one already!!!",10
Stop Clutching Your Pearls,"This is wonderful, escapist ALTERNATE UNIVERSE fantasy. It's based on a series of romance novels, the most ridiculous and popular genre ever. It follows its own set of rules, just like a Chinese martial arts movie when fighters fly through the trees. Just admit you can't deal with Black people in high social positions and get over it. It's not historically accurate, duh. The costumes and sets are wonderful, women get to enjoy sex, and everyone lives in a silly, strict, social order that is very true. I think it's perfect pandemic entertainment.",8
And just like that... from bravo! to garbo.,"Something went sideways with Season 2. If you're expecting the raw passion, attraction (emphasis on attraction) and energy from Season 1, which was phenomenal, by the way, prepare to potentially be sorely disappointed.I was aware beforehand there would be less sexually charged scenes, but reports alluded to this season being ""steamy."" It was anything but. Regardless, that wasn't the issue. There was just no chemistry, generally speaking, and everything fell flat. I'm clearly not the only one that noticed (see other reviews).The facial expressions, body language, voice inflections and timing were more miss than hit, and thus, Season 2 was full of awkwardness and miscues, and completely missed the mark. Maybe it's a director issue, who knows. It's a mystery I care not to waste time investigating. And I repeat, I'm not the only one that noticed this.Part of it was the casting. Chandran and Ashley, I'm sorry to say, were ill-fitted for their roles. Perhaps this particular Rhimes adaptation of the Sharmas just didn't click as intended. It all seemed very forced and is so far away from the book, it's almost criminal. Good intentions for diversity (per Rhimes' Marie Claire interview), but... it failed abysmally.I would have given 8 stars, but taking some off for this catastrophe called Season 2. One extra star for Golda Rosheuvel, who, btw, is delightful, perfectly cast as Queen Charlotte, and is a joy to behold!Let's hope some lessons have been learned, and that Season 3 will right this ship.",2
Critics can't be out of their leading strings and are not in the 'ton',"I've never heard the word 'ton' so much in my life, prior to watching this the only time I'd heard it was to mean 'fashionable' in cryptic crosswords, rather than 'fashionable society/high society/ the aristocracy' here. 'Leading strings' is another rare and outdated expression that refers to a baby's reins. The cheesy dialogue doesn't stop ones enjoyment though, nor does the surfeit of wigs on display (wigs having become rare after the tax on wig powder, introduced in 1795) and the racial situation (though I do note the hypocritical reaction that would ensue if plays went back to having white people playing Othello).I enjoyed watching this, if only to see who the mysterious gossiping lady was in the end. The silly pledge the Duke of Hastings made to his his father is an unconvincing plot device but even that is a source of amusement and allegedly appears in the book.All in all this shouldn't be taken too seriously, or rated too highly, but is entertaining enough to merit an 8 out of 10.",8
Enjoyable escapism,"I enjoyed this series for what it is, pure escapism. Not historically correct but fun, with great acting, quirky characters and a good story that had me engaged till the end",9
addicting from the first episode,"This series was everything! It was addicting from the very first episode on and I binged it in less than a day! So so good! I highly recommend it!
The characters are brilliant! I will definitely read the books and hope for another season of this amazing show!",10
Actually quite loved it,"If you, like me, are into anything Jane Austen has originally written and that features Keira Knightley, then you'll love this. Sure, it is not historically correct and all that, but it is so entertaining and left me with such a happy feeling in me. Hoping for a second season since it did end on a continuous note! (Btw Simon is the best looking guy I've probably ever seen soooo)",9
Hope there is more to come,"I read a lot of bad reviews about this serie, and I don't really understand that. I really liked it.
I did not read the books, so I'm not aware of the similarities or the lack of them.
But to be honest, I don't care.
The diversity is really refreshing, the costumes and settings are amazing and it's very well acted (I've seen soooo much worse).
So, people who give points as 1 or 3 are haters in my eyes that have very few respect.
NEVER has a movie been a perfect copy of the book, there are more than enough examples (best examples for me are LOTR, Harry Potter, ...)
Nevertheless the movies are jewels on their own way.
You can read and watch and try to find the 'mistakes', or you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy with an open mind...
The choice is totally yours...",9
A real fun and sensory experience.,"So many colourful characters and scenery to take in. It comes across as less of a tv series and more of a theatre production, which is BRILLIANT. I also loved the subtle nods to fairy tale characters (think Cinderella, ugly step sisters). A visually beautiful show to watch, but the chemistry between Basset and Daphne is believable, and you really want them to succeed. Suspend any uppity notions of how a ""proper"" regency era drama should be done, and think more along the lines of the incredibly successful Broadway show, Hamilton. Have fun!",9
Not as bad as you think,"It's not as bad as you think. I knew that this was some modern pop culture kind of Downtown Abbey comparable but I thought that Daphne and Simon's chemistry was unmatched for.There are some bad side character stories and some good ones - Anthony and Siena was an example of a good story where older brother Anthony refuses to marry his long time mistress and depends on his younger brothers to do the marrying and his mistress later leaves him because she's done being treated like a doormat.And then there are bad side character stories like Eloise and finding who Lady Whistledown is. I think the revelation at the end (SPOILER) that her best friend Penelope Featherington was the culprit all along was more disappointing than anything else in the show.I thought Simon's childish antics about not having children as revenge against his father was silly but Penelope being Lady Whistledown was sillier. That's literally the only reason why I cannot give it 10 stars.The show is probably worth watching for Simon and Daphne's relationship and chemistry. Daphne is innocent and new on the market while Simon is a rake, it's interesting to see how she learns the world of having children as the shows goes on. I think my favourite person on the show is Lady Danbury though, hands down.",9
perfect,"The adaptation didn't lose the essence of the series, its changes were not bad, the cast is perfect, I loved it",10
Fell in love with Bridgerton - A Period Piece where the diverse ensemble cast works the more you watch.,"For the first half of episode 1, I was trying to figure out the diversity in casting of the Queen, Duke of Hastings and rest of the cast. However by the end of episode 1 I was hooked and had fallen in love with the story and acting. Quite different than the books, Bridgerton, the Neflix series has more influences of today - contemporary songs remade with orchestra pieces - that help set the tone and the mood of the story.
This is a smart and updated version of Bridgerton with lead characters who carry it off quite elegantly.
I am already waiting for season 2. I will admit I watched three episodes in a row and then picked it back up later in the day as soon as I had a chance.
If I would suggest anything it would be I that the show should have given the explanation of why the diverse cast works in the ""Bridgerton World"" from the beginning in the first episode instead of explaining it in later episodes.",8
great show,I watched the entire season in one day. hope season 2 will follow,9
Lightweight lowbrow soft porn trash from USA,"This serial looks pretty, and appeared to promise an interesting new angle on regency period drama, in the same vein as The Knight's Tale and medieval England, but it turned out to have major flaws. Above all the sheer quantity of gratuitous soft porn sex scenes...maybe this works in a certain segment of the US market, but I doubt that it will please a more discerning UK and European audience. I could eventually accept some of the many glaring anachronisms (eg Offenbach's 'Belle Nuit' in 1813?!), but why on earth use the very well known real name of 'Cliveden' with locations which are quite patently nothing to do with that place?
Period fantasies can work well, for example the contrast between Bridgerton and the wonderful Harlots series is massive. Hard to believe a second season is apparently to be dredged up. Bright points were some of the acting performances, notably the Duke and Duchess of Hastings, Lady Danbury and the Duchess's mother.",3
Great show,"I love ❤ this show.
Not because of story but starcast also
Miss bridgeton , Mr Simon hasting and Danbury shows greatest performance...
Story line is perfect
Not bored at any time...
I love the romance 💏💏💏💏.. Of beautiful ages group",9
I absolutely love this show!,"I'm not really a big fan of period dramas, but I'm in love with the show!",9
Best of 2020,Idiots to those who criticize this series. I love it and it's awesome . Just watch it with open minds and appreciate the actors.,10
Beautiful,"It has truly make me feel a full spectrum of emotion and I've looked forward to the next episode more and more.
I've now finished the first season and loved every minute, I can't wait for another season.
This isn't my usual genre of entertainment and I watched thinking it probably wouldn't be my cup of tea, but by the 3rd episode I was hooked, give it a chance, it's worth it.",9
Exquisitely addictive!,How I describe this beautiful show/series is 'Flawless'The costumes and sets are stunning. The actors are fantastic! each different to the other!Everything flows together beautifully! And the locations and buildings are stunning!Nothing but a 10/10 here,10
waste of time,"Very disappointed. bad acting and the actors are totally devoid of presence and charm. therefore, there is no chemistry, there is no passion, there is no beauty. everything very badly done, it seems that I am watching an open TV show for teenagers. ridiculous",1
Is it too soon for a 2nd binge watch?,"I'm not a huge fan of historical drama if I'm honest, they usually pass me by. However, there was absolutely nothing good to watch over Christmas and my friends were raving about Bridgerton so I thought I'd give it a whirl. I am so glad I did!! Well acted, sublime soundtrack/musical score, generally just an amazing watch. I was hooked from start to finish. I would recommend it to everyone!",10
Loved it so much!,"Everything about the story, the costumes, the places, actors, the chemistry, was amazing. The queen is the most unforgettable queen character i have ever seen on tv , loved every detail of her. Cant wait for season 2!!!!",10
Lovely and nicely done,"Loved it. I am a fan of the book but i love the slight changes of the content which made the series more dramatic but also more worthy to watch. The love story is brilliant. The characters are nicely described with their own flaws which somehow more realistic than in the book.
Loved the modern music whenever i hear them i laugh a lot.",10
Season 2 is gold!,"Season 2 is far far better that season one! Amazing acting by Jonathan Bailey! Simone Ashley is beautiful! Her acting could be better in some places, but overall loved her! The slow burn in this season was everything! Binged it multiple times already! It definitely makes you feels those intense moments breathtakingly. A must watch for all!",10
Outstanding NETFLIX!,"Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant!I can't say enough about this series. I binged the whole 8 episodes! Excellent writing and amazing performances!10 stars isn't enough! Can't wait for next series!",10
Asleep with my eyes open,This show was such a bore I have no idea how it got high reviews. One of the worst shows I've seen to date.,1
Bridgerton on a totally different level,"I was (still am) literally obsessed with this show! No surprise it's listed top show, from the first episode I was glued to the screen..Acting, script, locations, costumes and so on are totally stunning. I love the different characters that you just get to love!Unequivocally, an extraordinary show",10
Fun funny sweet show,"Mix of historic fiction with modern style gossip girl cross reference. Fun, funny, romantic, and filled with mystery. I like that it is different from other shows, very creative. Great actors, and script, beautiful costumes, and music is creative mixed with modern with hint of classical such as billie ellish, marron five etc.. highly recommend",10
Wonderful,Beautiful sets and costume. Enjoyable plot with plenty of twists. Unfortunately some people are offended by black people appearing on screen. It's funny given that most period dramas have numerous inaccuracies from dates to storylines but apparently these dont matter at all. Strange its almost like they have a hidden agenda?,10
Beautiful escapism fantasy romance,Loving it so far. Read all the books and this is such an enjoyable show.,10
Wonderful!,"I really loved this! It's a wonderful love story, full of drama and pride and a lot of love in many ways. I binged it in two days and will see it again for sure!",10
Not good,Omg this is the worst thing that ever happened to Historical Drama. All these inaccuracies both historic and from the book. It is so bad. I don't understand what kind of statement are they trying to make. Let's also do a remake of Mulan with white people to add diversity. It is getting even more annoying season by season. Can someone please do this show right? Following the books (which by the way are more historically acurate) and save all this drama?Horrible Horrible and for feather headed people. Let's all swallow American productions. I would have love to see that made by the English. Effort would have been so much better.,1
Wonderful,"Ok, I was shocked at the beginning, I must confess. It was like why, why? I love period dramas, and the inclusion of people of color in those roles was not realistic and made me think of a bad joke. But I decided to give it a go, nothing better to do today. And oh my god. Once you have watched 20 mins, you are just captivated by it. I bing watched it. And rewatched again cause it is a beautiful story, music is great, to die for outfits. And the acting cast just wonderful actors, also beautiful. What a great show. Vibrant, colorful, exceptional.",10
Captivating and Witty,"There are eight episodes of the Bridgerton series, each are very good chapters, just like a book! You are gripped and this is what good writing and of course acting should do!Bridgerton is funny, very daring, exhilarating and I love the costumes and music!There are a number of actors that really stand out and who are funny and natural.. but all the cast were very good!",10
Oh my; I'm in love!,"Words couldn't possibly explain how much in love I feel with this Tv Series. Where do I begin? The story? The directing? The clothes? The places chosen? The actors? Ok; one or two could have better performances, but the final result is so magnificent!To make this critic basic though and in the same time, as honest as it's gets, it reminded of this pop song lyric: ""I am mad at Disney, they tricked me; had me wishing on a shooting star"" and that's exactly what this piece of movie art, made to me. I was on my toes during every episode, I gasped so many times, it made me believe again and dream and it even make me hope again!In case you wonder about the reason why ""I am mad"", it's because of the fear of never living this dream they created! Some may disagree, some may want different things; but in my eyes this is the kind of love I seek and value! Getting over the difficulties and falling in love with the real self, even the flawed one..
But please don't take this in the wrong way, these series were not a Cinderella movie, it was speaking truth and that's exactly what makes you fall over heels in love with it, the fact that you can see parts of yourself in every single character and feel their needs, lust, passion, feelings, while opening a window to the past!Anyway, Everyone who has worked for this amazing creation, should be proud for what they have made and I and I am sure many many MANY others wait for more!!",10
It's so good!,Didn't know this was based on a book but gosh I binged the show and I LOVE it so much!I don't know why people are bashing on the acting but it's top notch just like everything else about it,10
Awesome,I don't understand why people hate this. Who cares if it's accurate or not it's a TV show. If you want accurate watch a documentary. I loved Downton Abbey and this show is amazing!,10
This is pretty bad...,"I was going to give this a chance until a heard a string quartet version of Ariana Grande's ""Thank You, Next"" It was then that I realized this is just some silly, cheap series targeted to younger viewers. No thank you, next?",1
Simon and Daphne sitting in a tree...,"Great series!!!To the readers and reviewers, do you really remember any of the other characters in this series other than Simon and Daphne?
I believe this is the first time I've ever seen an interracial couple in a drama series as captivating and believable as these two. They really seem to be in love with each other.This show is a fun, fictional depiction of England during the late 1700s, as it should have been ... people of different races thriving, and simply getting along.This show offers comedy, romance, and mystery. The one possible negative could be the sex scenes. Some sex scenes are a bit revealing, so you may need to cover ""the little ones"" eyes for a bit. I liked them!I definitely recommend this series. You will not be bored!!!",9
Bad reviews? This show is number one is 76 countries,"""Bridgerton"" has reached No. 1 overall on Netflix in 76 countries. As a matter of fact, it has made the Top 10 in all 190 countries that Netflix is available in, save one: Japan.Facts are above! I think it's amazing! I can't wait for the next season! And people who don't like the show (I really don't know how) are narrow minded, or did you audition and didn't get the part?! Makes me wonder what is going on with the negativity?Top Show",10
Season 2 was brilliant; better than season 1!,"Season 3 review: a special place in my heartOk, so I'm writing this whilst in episode 3, Forces of nature. I was hoping I could watch this earlier in the evening, but as a lawyer I work late. I thought I'd watch 1 episode then go to bed after starting this at 10pm, but I just cannot stop watching. Luke's acting in this episode is fantastic. The moment at the end between Pen and Colin...I rewinded several times.I wasn't sure how I'd find this season.. initially I was excited but the marketing was overkill, because anyone who's read the book knows how awesome Polin's story is. I mean it's the book I've read most out of the Bridgerton series. So my view was ...how could you not know what date their season was and not being excited to watch.However over the top the marketing was, the romance and the beautiful moments between Penelope and Colin is warming my heart and making me cry happy tears. I can only imagine how I will feel once I get to part 2 and after all the nuances and changes in their love story and their relationship dynamic.Luke Newton and Nicola Coughlan are brilliant in this. I knew they would smash it and they absolutely have. Romancing Mr Bridgerton is my favourite story from Julia Quinn's fantastic Bridgerton series, so I've read this book several times (especially cause we were forced to wait 2 years) and know all the special Polin moments, and whilst some variables have changed, they have kept key moments in.This is romcom heaven. Romance and comedy- I can't stop smiling or laughing, especially with the beautiful awkwardness. I knew Nicola could do comedy from Derry Girls (check it out if you haven't), but love that both her and Luke are brilliant with their comedy and awkwardness as Penelope and Colin. It just fills my heart and makes my mouth hurt with smiling.I will write again after watching part 2. It's challenging to review each season of Bridgerton. But Bridgerton has reminded me what it was like to be a teenager and love something passionately even though I'm in my 30s. I'm still a teen a heart.I love Polin's story. I was curious about how graphic they would make the carriage scene...I thought it was modest compared to the book but still good. I like how they switched some of the lines. I.e. Colin said what Pen said once the carriage stopped...but I always love the carriage scene. I liked their version...I love the passion that comes when Polin argues (similar to the fiery passion that Kanthony has) so looking forward to seeing that in part 2.All in all part 1 for me is 9/10. 1 point is deducted for splitting the season into 2 and making me wait 1 month. And knowing that I will want to sit through and watch the show all thought again....but that's really a delight instead of a chore. However, if it wasn't split....not sure how I'd fare at work tomorrow at least this way I get some sleep.Luke and Nicola were 10/10...the cast is 10/10...can't wait to see the second half of Polin's love story and see everyone else develop. Also the rest of the cast is brilliant as always but maybe we haven't had as many Bridgerton family moments...I mean the pall mall scene in season 2 is excellent, as is the dancing scene. So whilst I love the focus of Polin's love story I also hope we get to see more moments of everyone together. I enjoy.th Featherington moment.... I'm a big fan of Portia and love every scene she's in. I feel the same for Queen Charlotte, Lady Danbury, Lady Violet Bridgerton so let's keep all their scenes coming.Hannah Dodd as Francesca is excellent...they really brought out her character traits in this season and I was remembering bits from her season. Claudia is outstanding too ...showing her compassion for all these complicated characters she's friends witj. I never had a problem with her being friends with Cressida...I like that she sees the heart in her whilst still loving Pen even though she's pissed at her. But then I like a complex character... it's the same reason I like Penelope. Also seeing Colin grapple with his emotions and showing the angry side of Colin. Truly outstanding. Nicola is the beautiful smart girl and represents all us smart girls ...she was superb and I just want her to be happy. I can't wait to see fully happy Polin after they've overcome all their obstacles. Love this show so much (next time we don't need the marketing rammed down our throats ... people who knows it great know it's great... people who haven't heard must be living under a rock...ok my rant is over)Let's go part 2. Also at the end of episode 4 I was literally on my feet watching with excitement ... it's that good and beautifully acted.Season 2 was brilliant; better than season 1!I didn't think Bridgerton or the writers could do it; I didn't think they could make me love Anthony and root for his love story, as he was my least fave character in season 1; but boy was I wrong. I was a hardcore fan of Simon and Daphne; but they've been eclipsed by my love and rooting for Anthony and Kate. Once I got to episode 3...I had to watch the rest of this season asap and probably did so in a night and a bit which wasn't great for my working from home schedule! I've not read any of the books but I will order this one. I just adore their love story and their conflict with their sense of duty to their family contrasted with their own personal desire and love for each other, which I can absolutely relate to. I'm an avid fan of Austen books, and possibly an even greater fan of the variations (I mean I also like to see what P&P would be with sex in it!) Anthony and Kate's story reminded me of a combination of Austen stories: Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy (the love/hate romantic connection from Pride & Prejudice my fave Austen book), Marianne and Eleanor Dashwood (the Sense and Sensibility sisters both pursuing love with different dispositions), and Emma and Harriet (from Emma - falling for the same guy in Mr Knightley and Emma's conflict in respect of this).I watched the show in less then 2 days because I had a couple of busy work days. But, if I didn't work, I would have watched it all in one sitting. This show helped me recover from a headache- that's how delightful it was.If I have one criticism, I feel that we didn't get enough Anthony and Kate. So naturally, I'm going to rewatch immediately and also buy the book so I can learn every party of their love story. Also, I hope we get to see more of their love in the next seasons considering Kate is now Lady Bridgerton!In terms of the other characters: the Bridgerton mum was fantastic portraying her grief, and I loved every scene with her, Daphne and Lady Danbury; plus all scenes where they were featured together. Look forward to seeing more of them in the latter seasons cause their also brilliant. I too laughed hysterically at the wedding when Violet Bridgerton and Lady Danbury laughed after having no idea what to do next, and when they tried to appease their queen (who also put in a strong performance). I did miss Simon
initially and felt sad that we didn't get to see him and Daphne together but we did see their cute child! But let's be honest, I was here for the great love story between Anthony and Kate, and that's why I'm watching again and again (which I did not do for season 1- only watched that once). If I could have a condensed version of only their scenes together then that would be a truly great gift. I think YouTube will provide thisJonathan Bailey and Simone Ashley were absolutely superb!! Please let's see them in the latter seasons together or I will be truly sad! I want more if their love story... maybe I should check for a variation!9/10 due to too much Feathertons when I wanted more Bridgerton scenes!",10
Completely Binge Worthy,"I only watched this because some friends had posted on social media about it. I don't typucally care for sappy drama and I'm not a huge fan of period pieces. I have never seen Downton Abbey. With all that said, I totally got sucked into this story. The characters are well thought out and I loved the drama between Daphne and Simon.",10
"Just Amazing, Great cast, Great Production & Costumes","This show will not disappoint you. It has romance, drama, scandal and the most AMAZING CAST!!!

Beautiful costumes. Lovely story. A great escape.,"It's like an adult, non-musical version of Brandy's Cinderella. Though set in the past, it's not historical. It's a lovely story with rumors and drama. A bit of ""gossip girl"" narration. It's a fun escape. The costumes and sets are picturesque.",10
"It is just bad,..","But disney castle in opening scene and words ""it's a fairytale' would add some sincerity to this hideous tv story...",1
Love and perfect representation!,"The series, in my opinion, has more strengths than weaknesses, like the great costume and the perfect soundtrack, and the scenario wins over anyone, and the actors' choices would not change any, from my point of view, even the series being at the time, I see no reason not to choose black actors for the roles of royalty, since the stereotype that black actors can only play slaves or butlers, does not help in the fight against racism today. (my opinion)",10
Gorgeous Fiction,"Bridgerton made for entertaining watching, and judged on its own, it's a delightful romance swathed in period taffeta, jewels, ornateness, decorum, and rule breaking. The fictional story did some very interesting things in its narrative (and some have panned that): its inclusive casting, and as I saw it, a female-centered (if not feminist) perspective and the claiming of female agency, physical, emotional, and intellectual, despite the constraints of conventional patriarchal norms. I really liked that the lead female character (Dynevor) was full of personality and worked hard to define herself for herself as much as possible, going against the grain, and forging her personal path through various challenges and setbacks. She stands up for her emotional/romantic happiness and does not compromise or ""settle"" in the affairs of her heart, which is a rather more modern notion dressed up in period costume. The show lent itself to very interesting analyses by the choices it made, and it posited some different perspectives that in a way reimagine history by setting it in a fiction genre--i.e., projecting a ""what if"" world vs a documentary ""what was/what is"" one. Fantasy, fiction, or even historical fiction, have plenty to offer on their own genre's terms, juat as does Bridgerton.",10
It was a fun frolic!,"I've just binged watched this! Reading other reviews yes it wasn't historically correct, so what it was different, fun and entertaining and raunchy!! Made me forget Covid-19!! I think the negative reviews all have got lockdown fever!",10
Over The Top.,"And I don't care. Everyone should put their brain in neutral and just sit back and enjoy the gossip, the scandal and the lives of aristocrats from a past era. However fictional it may all be.Visually, gorgeous, finely drawn characters (who one get's to choose their favorites). Personally, I like Lady Bridgerton, Eloise and Penelope the most. Daphne (mainly from series 1) was likeable but a little ""Jennifer Love Hewitt"" at times. And one can't forget the characters one loves to hate...
I also liked the effective use of the music, mainly played at ""The Balls"", String versions of songs written 170 years in the future. ""Material Girl"" anyone?I don't usually like this type of stuff much but I found this one of those rare shows that I actually looked forward to watching the next episode.",9
"If you're not a 16 year old girl, avoid this one.","It's not just bad, it's shockingly bad. I really tried to give it a chance by watching 5 cringeworthy episodes but found myself fast-forwarding through more than I watched then finally gave up.",10
Stellar,I was shocked at all the negative reviews. This series was captivating to myself being one who gets fidgety. I watched it in 2 days and hoping for a sequel. This was written to entertain in a modern world which gave it more character and much fun to watch. The sensual scenes were romantic and not morally inept like most love scenes. This is my first movie review in my 60 years. I was compelled to share my experience because it is a must see for everyone.,9
Stop Frowning; Bridgerton Is Nothing But Niceness!,"For the sheer attention to nuance that the maker works out to the screen and of course, the characterization which is removed from complacency and expediency, not to mention the tired orthodoxy, I think this is the best gift art could ever have given us in the COVID-19 LOCKDOWN of 2020. Kudos to Netflix!The haters' hate for this masterpiece is almost predictable; they are fatigued by the lockdowns. Nothing fascinates them anymore. And Shondaland, for a second, thought could do just that -- bring a little sunshine to everyone's darkness -- only for these angry ones to unleash their bad energy -- albeit they watched all eight of them, episodes.Clearly, the show was no documentary about British royalty which is what is pissing people off -- Bridgerton's only a work of fiction. And who is saying anything about political correctness???
English royalty is no deity; it can and should be twisted and stretched to as far as poetic license allows.And actors of color can pull off that task too; it's not and should not be just affirmative action. That would be weird. The times, simply, demand ""freshness"" and ""re-imagination"" and so did, Bridgerton, splendidly, re-inventing the presentation of British royalty.For ""accurate"" accounts of the olden days of British society, I am positive, in some future, BBC will be working on the role of royalty in the expansion of the empire to Australia and Africa and how thus the people and cities of Britain prospered and flourished.Then I might join the wagon too, advocating passionately that stories be told as they exactly happened -- with utmost accuracy -- and full character and demeanor of all the characters/actors. After all, we will be doing history justice. Forget arts. Who cares for Netflix's fantasies?!!!Lastly, interracial couples are a reality now in our society; we should begin to accept them on screen already. And in our reviews. It's not Hollywood forcing them on us. They're part of us. And they're adorable couples. Stop frowning, gosh!!!Anyway, at least, now you know I read between the lines.",9
"Pride, Prejudice and Gossip","Bridgerton in my opinion is a wonderful show. A true delight from episode 1 to 8. This show is the perfect inspirational concept of a Jane Austen novel with ""Gossip Girl"" and it succeeds in that brilliantly.Of course it applies modern themes which blend well with the story. The production design is beyond belief as well as costumes, cinematography and the amazing score. The cast is also excellent! The two leads are fresh and full of star power! And there's the mystery of who is Lady Whistledown which is great!There have been people saying that it's not as good as Downtown Abbey or Jane Austen's work or a decent Disney movie. But the show does not try to be that!!! For me Bridgerton is unique in its own right. It's like this show is a cupcake full of sugar, sprinkles, cream, and chocolate filling. It's not for everyone but those who love it will.",10
Entertaining historical romance with a modern twist.,"If you are into historical romanticism in a Jane Austen-like way, and you don't mind a few modern twists, then Bridgerton is definitely the thing for you. The settings are beautiful, the costumes luscious, the acting is top notch, and the romantic entanglements are worthy of any of Jane Austen's novels.The already mentioned nowadays twists are reasonably modest, but will nonetheless give historical purists probably much to nitpick about: the (too) exuberant and colorful dresses of especially the Featheringtons; some of the anachronistically modern music that is played on balls; or a Queen who almost carelessly wanders among her subjects and meddles into their personal affairs. And of course the thing that Bridgerton became inmediately famous for: the seemingly random dispersion among the characters (be it aristocrats or servants), of actors of all kinds of colour and ethnic background. True, it doesn't fit the factual circumstances in 18th century Great Britain. But it's a wonderful and laudable diversity statement of the makers, that for me worked like a charm.I still had some minor reservations. Both main storylines (the romance and the hunt for Lady Whistledown) are rather flimsy and seem to be dragged a bit out of proportions to fill up all the 8 episodes. The romantic drama is at least entertaining, but to be honest: the whole Lady Whistledown plot is hardly interesting, way too farfetched, and actually became more and more tedious. Several tiny sub plots are only poorly worked out (like the brother who wants to become a painter), or came a bit out of nowhere and didn't lead to anything (like the fraudulent Featherington-scheme). And since diversity seemed to be such an important issue, I kept hoping for a gay storyline, with so many brothers in the Bridgerton family. Maybe a nice thought for a next season?A last word of praise for the dialogues: such strikingly beautiful English is spoken throughout all the episodes and by all characters, it's an absolute and rare treat!",8
Thank you for the soundtrack,"I had no expectations and this came out:
Music: 100/10
Characters: 9/10
Chemistry: 10/10
Feeling: 10/10
Story 7/10",9
Boring.,Not worth watching. What a disappointment. Netflix should use their money to produce better shows.,1
Loved it,"Just as a simple story , this show is quite good , neat n clean set pieces and excellent chemistry between thr lead pair.",9
Haters are going to hate,"If you want your fantasy to be realistic then you shouldn't be watching fantasy. As a fan of the books and the author of the books, I absolutely loved it Ms. Rhimes version of the Bridgertons (except Anthony). I went in 100% expecting it to be more soap opera so of course it can't stay 100% faithful to the books. It isn't supposed to be social commentary or a history lesson it's supposed to be a fun escape which most stories are. I only gave 9 stars because Anthony wasn't such an a$$hole in the books but they sure got the pressure he's feeling exactly right. I hope we get glimpses of the Smith/Smythe family in the next seasons (cousins to the Bridgertons). I feel sorry for those who can't just enjoy something without having to nitpick it to death to be edgy.",9
A visual joy that plays with your expectations,"This is truly a masterpiece. After sitting through all seasons of Downton Abbey a few times and enjoying the formal, dark and historically correct dramas on the countryside, this series is the exact opposite.Colorful city life, full of decadence, emotions and sex exploits everything left in the genre that has not yet been portrayed on screen. It is witty dialogue combined with casual erotics, over the top fashion and a bright mix of people of all colors and sizes posing in all society groups.It is truly a visual joy to watch, and a breath of fresh air among historical dramas. It mocks the diamond of the season, the pretty main character girl who is usually made a perfectly composed vision of innocence tormented by the agony of love, and the supporting roles have equally important and interesting storylines.If you are looking for a feelgood series with a fast moving story and exquisite enovironments and relatable characters this is your go-to. This is Donwton Abbey meets Marie Antionette goes post-modern bonanza.",9
Brilliant fun!,"Bridgerton is a great series, fun, easy watching.Some critic saying it is historically incorrect and some what insult I feel take it far to seriously. It is meant to be entertaining and never claims to be factual in anyway!A mostly brilliant cast, though the actress playing Marina Thompson's acting let down the era somewhat, the character Eloise a definite favourite, lovely music and lovely story line. My favourite thing is that the first season ends the story exactly where you would want it. It completes the seasons story so you're no anxiously awaiting the next but still leaves you wanting more!",9
What happened to the necklace?,Loved it! Costumes wonderful. But I'm obsessing over who found the gorgeous necklace that Prince Frederich gave Daphne? She ran out of the ball and left it on a rock wall right before she met Simon in the garden. WTF?,9
Disapointing,"Hate that they have strayed so far from the books(thumbs down) they should have stayed more true to the authors work and not change so much. And the casting... OMG!!!!! It's one thing to be political correct on other shows,but cast coloured ppl as upper society in a show about 19th century england society is a bit to much... No offence to dark ppl,I am all for divercety.",2
Must watch!,"This show is phenomenal. The characters are interesting and have so much chemistry. The storyline never got boring and was quite unpredictable. The costumes were gorgeous and the music was perfect. I loved that they used modern songs rather than all period songs. I will say, there are essences of gossip girl but much more realistic and without so much unnecessary repetitive drama. I can't stop thinking about the show!!",10
It's basically a CW version of Downton Abbey...,...and I loved every minute of it. Don't go into it with any higher expectations than that. It's a guilty pleasure for those who enjoy Masterpiece Theater but also watched Vampire Diaries when no one was looking. It moves quickly and is the perfect binge watch. Already looking forward to season 2!,8
A new take on a historical era,"Hooked from the first episode and love the diversity amongst actors/characters.
A mix of Downton Abbey and Gossip Girl and it works.",8
"It's Entertainment, Not A History Lesson. Enjoy the show.","To those that say it's not historically accurate, a la the mixed cast, I say so what? It got me to imagining what an integrated world at the time might have meant for us now. It's ""Emily in Paris"" across the Channel at an earlier time and I loved Emily in Paris. The deeper you get into the story, the more enticing and fun it becomes. It goes without saying that the visuals are sumptuous but the script/plot are fine as well too. Highly recommended.",8
Everything perfect and beautiful!,"Wonderful and impeccable plot. The casting was just perfect. The black representation in the series was all good, it was magnificent to see black characters as the protagonist.
I love you, Bridgerton",10
One of the best shows ever,"Don't believe the 1 star ratings because I truly don't know what show they where watching. Is this historically accurate? Nope.. is this based on real life? Nope. But what this is is GREAT show. The storyline will have you watching episode after episode. Acting is on point. Shonda Rhimes created the LONGEST running medical drama on tv, is that 100% accurate?? Nope, but it's entertaining as is Bridgerton. Just watch it, you'll be happy you did.",10
Ignore the 1 star reviews,"If you do not enjoy period dramas with a diverse cast that centre on romantic stories, don't watch this show and then pretend to be horrified by it. This is a Shonda Rhimes period drama and delivers exactly what you would expect plus a little more. The script is quite good and the story is entertaining. A bit of a breath of fresh air. I recommend this show to its intended audience.",8
"Bodice ripping, colour blind casting, and then there's the music","It's quite fun as long as you don't take it too seriously.
Do pay attention to the music at the parties/balls - Billie Eilish, Maroon 5, Shawn Mendes, Celeste, Taylor Swift, ...
A good distraction in these complicated times.",8
It gets better with season 2,"Do not give up on it, as season 2 is far better.Season1 was okay. Season 2 was amazing, engaging and not as graphic in terms of sex scenes. Great acting and love story that keeps you wanting more.",9
Only shonda can take period drama and turn it into gold!,"Absolutely loved this show, i love the connection between Daphne and Simon (the chemistry between those actors is amazing), the photography, music selection (that modern touch was like breathing fresh air), the wardrobe and the color palettes for each family was so detailed!Perfect for binge watching 2 or 3 times!Thank you Shonda for giving us something great this 2020!",8
Very immoral series,I definitely would not recommend. Immoral scenes and bad language. Truly disgusting. Could have been a good show but too much junk in it. Do not watch as a family or individual for that matter. Should be rated R.,1
Absolutely in awww of it,"The series is soooo perfectly put out -with the storyline , the cast, the acting and the love of Simon and Daphne. Also how the show brings into light various social issues along with it and how it showcases a family of Bridgestons so happy together ...all in all its a complete and perfect combo.i just loved it and personally I loved Daphne and Simon like anything",10
Bridgerton season 2... 100% better!,"So... I hated season 1. Beige & boring. Simon and Daphane were done badly. But this season - this book - much better!While the story told by Shondaland is still not the book I know and love, and consider the best version of the story... this season Netflixed re: Kate and Anthony, was a 100% improvement on last season. Yes (you pathetically sex obsessed Americans), is not full of gratitous sex scenes - thank you powers that be! No. This season was emotional and dwelt on interpersonal relationships.It was perfect. I cried through every other episode.Well done Shondaland. I now have hope heading into Season 3: Benedict & Sophie.",8
"Great, colorful movie with talented actors","What I love most is the atmosphere, great actors, the colorful clothes and rooms. The movie sweeps you away. Perfect and a nice kind of distraction in the present time. Simon is missing.",10
Loved the show!,Didn't know there were books but definitely going to be looking it up. Regè-Jean Page and Phoebe Dynevor had an amazing chemistry. Binged watched the whole thing in one day!,10
POC,"Nothing to see here in the reviews but white people having a problem with POC. It's funny that these same people DON'T have a problem with whites CONSTANTLY telling historical stories about POC, without POC. Don't listen to the bad reviews, most of the people had a problem with DIVERSITY.... cloaked in historical bulls***. SMH",10
Great fun for Season 2!,"Season 2More pomp less romp in season 2.Two new characters join the fray. Two sisters, the older sister Kate (Simone Ashley) Sharma (of SexEd fame) has apparently trained her younger sister in all that it is to be a good and dutiful wife - played by
Edwina Sharma (Charithra Chandran) who is now out to find herself a catch.So far so good. Charithra is very pretty, but.. unfortunately she looks about 10 years old. Unbelievably she is 25 years old in real life. This makes for slightly uncomfortable viewing. Her acting is also a bit meh, which jars a bit at times. She is only saved in these scenes by her older sister. Simone Ashley is stunning. She has a face that you simply cannot ignore. Her dark skin and chiselled looks are made for the screen. But it is her acting which steals the scenes for me. I think Simone is going to be a huge star after this.The story line is thinly veiled. If you want deep and meaningful then don't bother watching. This is a lot of fun. I have no idea why they decided to not have as much flesh this season but it is still very watchable.",9
Glorious,"I'm a life long Jane Austen fan, so am a sucker for Regency drama but this was quite something else!
The detail, casting, costumes, use of current music, cinematography, humour and story line were superb
The chemistry between Daphne and Simon was delicious and so believable. The range and diversity of characters kept my interest throughout but the traditional line of Austens story telling was so apparent it was sublime ..well done to all involved.",10
Don't ever care about the accuracy,"The series did not disappoint at all...The main actors chemistry is fire and makes me want to see more. All the characters were amazing the only thing was I didn't get why the featheringtons had all the problems in the series. that was not fair ..When they "" burn for each other"" as said..it was magnificent.",8
Not bad but a complete abomination compared to the books,"After viewing this show I rated it 7/10 and while I usually doubt naysayers who compare a three show to books, I have to agree with them here. When reading the incredible source material, the passably good show becomes awful. It was predictable, some of the characters were cliche and dull, and the ending was uninteresting, but overall I still found it to somehow be fun. Between a few decent actors and all the drama, as predictable as it was, the show itself was believable and there were a few, emphasis on few, enthralling moments.But then I felt the need to pick up the books. Every single interesting second in this show is taken out of the book and made worse. The dialogue in the books is always funny, quick witted and interesting, whereas the show did not have a single such moment. The parts of the show that were added were all so strange yet boring that they actually detracted from the experience. The characters are so much more complex, with many more problems that are specific to them, directly affecting their personalities, yet the show rarely shows any of these problems, instead focusing on their own added ""modern"" problems that add nothing to the stories, instead sucking all the personality from the characters, giving them little to like. The show is still fine, with the gossip lovers and the pretty good acting from several, and the costumes that match the character descriptions alright.I do note that this show had to cram 8 romantic novels, with different stories taking place over the course of many years or at different times, all into one show with one timeline. I can see how they tried to make things fit and it somewhat worked. The show itself may not be very good, but the fact that it is passable is an accomplishment; perhaps not a great one but an accomplishment nonetheless.",8
Perfection - light hearted period drama with a modern twisy,"This is everything you'd hope and wish for from Shondaland. It's a modernised, period drama with just enough of both to keep you hooked. The costume and set designs are to die for, the casting is perfection, it's beautifully done. Yes, sure the storyline isn't what people report the books to be, but for TV - this works. In the same way the Keira Knightly version of Pride and Prejudice shook things up, so has this.
I adore it, and have happily watched twice through already.",10
"Season 1 awesome , Season 2 is ridiculous","Me and my friends enjoying Season 1 very much, and very excited for Season 2.After watch the show , we are constantly annoyed. Badly executed make it seems like the elder sister is seducing his sister date.Daphne keep saying need to find someone make you exicited and challenging to marry. The Edwina is perfect wife , very peaceful with Anthony, why Daphne say it is not challenging and exiting enough, is she suggesting a toxic relationship that only argue all the time will be happy? Yet she also make the comment about having to find similarities before marry, so did she ? Did she found any similarities with duke before marrying him ?Season 2 logic is very different level with Season 1. Season 1 logic is very well, although Daphne did argue with duke, but she still remain reasonable polite level, Kate is very rude with argue with Anthony.I really hope it just stop at Season 1, cause even Daphne character become stupid and annoyed this time .Otherwise , the other brothers and sisters of bridgerton line , remain well.",4
Shonda Rhimes and Netflix Nailed it!,"Everyone is seeking their soul mate and to end up marrying one is a blessing indeed.
Shonda Rhimes and Chris Van Dusen have achieved something in this era of pop-culture that is a rarity. They have managed to bring forth a romance novel with a diverse caste. Not only that, they were able to bring tunes from famous melodies, harmonies and songs and wove them around the romance. Love it! You will find many shows and movies that aim to do it and fail miserably but not Shonda and Chris.
If you love Jane Austen novel where you always hope of lovers eventually findings each other then this one is sure for you. There is some heart-ache, there is some unrequited love but there is also great romance.
Dont even get me started on chemistry between Duke and Miss Daphne Bridgerton.
Their fights and their romance is expertly portrayed and something that you will find rarely in todays TV shows or movies.
Please be ready to get swept away by incredible background score by Kris Bowers.
Mixing a romance with incredible music is the way to do it and Van Dusen and Kris Bowers have hit it out of the park. The production value is outstanding and equivalent to what one would expect from Netflix.
The intimate scenes and level of nudity is appropriate for a romantic portrayal between lead characters in my opinion and never feel gratuitous.
I cant stress this enough it is awesome that in present times Netflix, Shonda and Chris were able to caste such a diverse group of actors, actresses and were able to portray characters from regency era.
This being a romantic show, get ready to watch it again and again. Kudos to Netflix, Shonda Rhimes, Chris Van Dusen and team in bringing this period romance to screen. Cant wait for the next season and hopefully multiple future seasons. Keep them coming Netflix!",10
People need to remember it's a book adaptation!,"So, everyone LOVED season 1, but many are slating the second series because it doesn't focus on the same characters. ITS A BOOK ADAPTATION!Spoiler: each book is based on a different Bridgerton sibling, so it appears the show will follow.Personally, I love the books and the show, I enjoy the changes they've made to make the show more inclusive, to ensure the other characters are more involved, and I love the different tone of the show to mimic the different character type.People need to stop whining because a show is actually following a book series!",10
Surprisingly good,"I do not know the books and came with expectations. I do love a good period piece, so seeing a diverse cast was odd to me at first. It did raise eyebrows for me. But then, from the get go, you clearly see that this isn't meant to be historical: contemporary twist on classical music, unrealistic plot etc... and surprisingly it worked for me! I got mesmerised by it and couldn't stop watching. The characters are charming: Simon's super hot, Daphne very cute, the Queen! Hell that really spelt it: hey! This is fantasy and meant to be fun. It's really really worked for me. It's colourful and wonderful. For once actors of colour are not confined to playing servants and it's a good change. It's fun, it's positive, it's well played, it's imaginative, just give it a go.",10
"This is a fantastic, fun period piece.","Please ignore any review using the word ""woke"" or stating "" I only watched the first episode"" This is a great period series that only gets better with each episode. I am 5 episodes in and all I keep thinking is that I can't wait for season 2.Let us start with how BEAUTIFUL it is. The scenery, the sets, the costumes....perfect. It is steamy, funny, dramatic, and the ever lingering mystery of the narrating gossip columnist could not be more engaging. And no one can overlook the love scenes.....I found myself holding my breath a time or two😊 IGNORE the haters and low raters....this is a fun one that many will enjoy.",10
Wokerton,"What an absolute load of drivel. Historical inaccurate, terrible acting, boring storyline. No doubt Ms. Rhimes is just trying to rewrite history by showing POC's in high society. The only POC's were waiting on the rich white folks. The conversations are completely boring. This is just an attempt at Wokeism. Do yourself a favor and give this a miss.",1
Are people forgetting what fiction means?,Clearly it isn't meant to historical correct. I enjoyed the show. Regé-Jean Page is beautiful. I also read the book and I actually liked the storyline of the show better. There are more details and other perspectives I found interesting which is usually the opposite when it comes to book to show.,10
Great show !!!!!!,"Great show tell about the love and romance
Nice
Great scene and great relationship between Duke and Duchess",8
Officially in love with Jonathon Bailey,"Let's be honest season 1 was just okay but the ""intimate"" scenes were thrilling enough to make this show huge. Season 2 delivered on an actual love story tethered to actual character development. Jonathan Bailey is superb. He can deliver so much with the subtlest shift in an eyebrow or intensity in his eyes. Lots of haters out there because of the relative lack of sex and departures from the book. But it was hot and passionate nonetheless and ultimately a touching real deal love story.",10
I love it,"I love the take Shonda Rhimes has on this historical romance series although I do wish Lady Whistledown hadn't been found out by anyone and that the reveal of who she is came at the end of the last season.I am so glad that Anthony finally got out of his own way and got together with Kate.I think that this series is a good first step into this genre keeping it simple and with a generally decent story line from the books although I do think if they are thinking of doing another series like this, they should look to Stephanie Laurens's Cynster series or the Bastion Club series now those are story lines that have drama aplenty for anyone along with great romance and from the descriptions in the books great sex too.",10
Wonderful 2nd season that compensated for the first!,"Though I do enjoy a love story, I did not find the first season so very interesting and it felt rather forced to go through with it. The second season, however, was such a delight that I could watch it again and again. The storyline, the character developments and the acting of the actors and actresses are much better, and so is the love in the second season. If one gives a chance to this series, one must see both seasons before making their judgement, or perhaps only the second one if the first one does not entertain, and probably see Queen Charlotte first which I might have liked the most among all. It would also make you understand the history and the qualities of the society presented in the series much better to first have seen Queen Charlotte before Bridgerton.Besides the wonderful love stories and sex scenes, I also love the elegant way they use English and the dresses, the decorations and all of the small details in the show. It's lovely that they display both white and black people perfectly blended into the society in the shows. It's such a great entertainment.",9
They perform the song 'wrecking ball' at the last ball!?!!,"When was the story of this TV show?? I dont think they had the song 'wrecking ball' by Miley Cyrus at that time?!! But that was the song the orchestra performed at the last ball, when Kate & Lord Anthony dance.",9
Addictive and enchanting,"It was beautiful. The story was complex and exciting. The cast truly drew the viewer in and brought the story to life. The scenery and costumes were elegant and brought the viewer into the world. The various storylines were raw, fun, and full of intrigue. Overall, it was a delight full of laughs, tears, and suspense.",9
"Entertaining, definitely worth a watch","I don't get all the hate, I absolutely loved both seasons. Very watchable, it's obviously fantasy and escapism I'm not sure why the low raters are taking it so seriously. I love the diversity and modern takes (colour palette, dress designs etc).",10
Registered just to make this review,"The reviews for every film are usually justified, except for this one. All the bad reviews are because of diversity. However, let me remind you that it was never meant to be historically accurate.
It is a great quality tv show where black people are equal to white and not portrayed as servants only. Finally, children will be able to sympathize with the main hero instead of asking their parents why are we portrayed as slaves in nearly all movies. The main message here is to imagine new dawn for humanity, which some time ago were two separate societies divided by color until a king fell in love with a queen. Love conquers all and can change everything. Be kinder.For anybody who wants to watch a visually stunning tv series, with great actors, and a captivating story - give it a try.",10
Incredibly Good,"This is an amazing show! Just watched episode one and went right into episode two. This is a unique storyline with some historical context to it, abs incredibly well done. The costumes are so artistic and the townships are in the most perfect settings.
I am watching this until there is no more!",10
A lovely adaptation,I read all the series of The Bridgerton and it is icredible how i could see the characters in the actors. I really loved everything,10
Gossip girl with a historic twist,Good production. I did not read the books so I can t tell how were they adapted. I don t mind the diversity issue. Good vibez,8
Season 3,"Season 3 definitely justified the two-year wait. And for the people who like the plot to follow the book, simply skip it. Although the book does not follow the plot 100%, it kept the core and honestly I think these 4 episodes are great. I know that we don't all like everything the same and that the series is not to everyone's taste. I don't expect the series to follow the plot of the book completely, but it's important to me that it doesn't change important facts, and that was achieved here. The clothing doesn't fully follow the fashion of the 1800s, and there is no need, because this is a fictional love story only set in that period. For those who loved the first two seasons, I think they will love the third one even more.",10
Better than expected!,I hesitated after the first two episodes because it was kind of boring and I had read some mediocre reviews but in the end this series was pleasantly enjoyable.Here is my analogy for those wondering if they should watch. It's The Crown mixed with Fifty Shades of Grey and narrated like Desperate Housewives. Super intense love scenes and despite not looking like a compatible match the main couple ended up working.Hopefully there is a second season in the works they've got the following for it.,8
Watching for the second time,"If you want to be entertain and if you have a sense of humor well this is the show for you. I love the casting, characters and the actors did a marvelous job. Each character's journey was well executed and a decent ending to the series in case there is not a second season. It is disappointing to see all the negative reviews especially for the reasons for the negative reviews. I didn't watch this show to get an accurate account of history. l watched ""Bridgerton"" so that I could be entertained.",10
Immaculate,"The casting is the best thing I have seen in a while!!!
I absolutely LOVED the books and they smashed it!!!
As far as I'm concerned the best book adaptations I have ever seen!",10
So good and unexpected,"I went into this series with a blank page, I didn't know what it was about, or what to expect. Haven't heard about the books, only chose to watch because it was so popular on netflix. And boy oh boy do I not regret it. I watched it all in one swoop! I normally don't like period shows, but this one had me hooked. I'm starting the books tomorrow. The acting is good, the sideburns awful, and the plot is exciting. Truly hoping netflix will make more seasons 🤞🏼",10
Just wonderful,"I watched the first season and loved it.. I was hoping season 2 would be just as good, and wow it was.. I'm hooked and can't wait for many more seasons
The cast is just wonderful, each character is is perfect
Love love love.",10
Absolutely magnificent,"I adore this show so much! The casting is brilliant and although it is of course not exactly as the book, the stories they added work perfectly I think. Can't wait for the next season!",10
Entertaining and different... which is great!,"I was surprised at all the bad reviews. I'm in my 30s and even though it did have elements of a teen drama, I really enjoyed it! The cinematography, the modern twist on classical music, the characters, the costumes and cast were excellent. It felt like gossip girl meets the crown and I was entertained and wanting to watch them all at once!I think the diversity was a really important part of its success and I'd love to see more shows with a cast like this!",9
Can't believe I had this rated at 9,"I quite enjoyed the first season apparently, despite the in-your-face political correctness of the ethnic diversity of the British aristocracy.The second season, however, makes me regret I even watched the first one. This time around, even the familiar characters seem much less amicable, and the acting skills of their portrayers much deteriorated. Every scene seems to have been completed in one take, as facial expressions and gesticulations seem animated exaggeratedly, and the moral of every character seem to have adopted the notion that the more self serving the sensation of love is, the more deserving one is of it. Notions of romance and vulnerability has been cast to the side by scheming and opportunism. Multiple scenes each episode are dedicated to mutual enabling of toxic behaviour, as well as endless recycling of similar scenarios, not to mention the cringeworthy placement of acoustics of modern day pop songs.But by far the worst thing about this season is that it is blatantly obvious how it will spell out already after watching the first 10 minutes, and then having to sit through the rest of the episodes witnessing its terrible execution and poor attempts at surprising the viewer and make us root for the obvious ending twist by making all parties involved ever less likeable.In short, I will certainly not be watching any potential future seasons.",2
It is what it is,"Jane Austen it's not, but I don't care. It is delightful trash and I didn't go into it expecting Shakespeare either. I remember reading these books because I could buy them from the CVS next door to my old job. Watching the show I realized I recognized the storyline and laughed out loud. I can't believe they made a show based on regency bodice rippers, and I couldn't be happier they did. This show breathes life into the insipid characters from the page, and does do with humor and without taking itself too seriously. The casting was well done and it's about time Hollywood realized that POC can do regency and bring a refreshing take on old staple. I loved Lady Danbury, Eloise and Penelope. Of course the Duke was smoking hot as he should be, and having read Julia Quinn's books I recognized other characters as well.
The fact is, if you're expecting a historically accurate period piece, you won't find it here. I can't imagine what people thought they were gonna get when they watched a show based on the Bridgerton books, but this exceeded any expectations I could have had.
If you want to watch some silly fluff, look no further.
I love it, and watched it with tongue in cheek.",10
I already want the second season,"Loved it! I love the books, and because I have been disappointed before with adaptations of books that I really like, I did not create expectations about Bridgerton. Best thing I've ever done! The adaptation is really very good in every detail, and even the small changes in the narrative were very welcome. And the detail I liked the most, apart from the cast (which is just wonderful), were the songs that served as background for the balls. I loved that contemporary touch.",10
A Wow factor indeed!,"A Wow factor indeed! A wonderful storyline of betrayal, scandal, love & the murder most fool. This a gripping tale that you would want share with your bff's over a pot of tea & biscuits. I advise the audience of this review of this post to read the Book; the Duke & I. I would love to be the Duchess of Hasting. With the proper etiquette and all. I can't wait on the upcoming books on Netflix.",10
Fab,"I don't know why there are so many bad reviews on this show.. it's so brilliantly done! Is funny, dramatic, powerful.
The costumes are on point and it's beautiful to watch!",10
A self-aware revisionist period piece,"Take all the bawdy soapy stuff from Riverdale and mix it with Downton Abbey's historical charm and you're getting close to what Bridgerton is all about. It knows it's a little outrageous, and it has a blast being itself.There are a lot of folks complaining about the diverse cast here... and these complaints should point to exactly how cunning this show is. It doesn't give a damn about history or accuracy and instead it wants to give a silly, sexy, and self-aware spin on a genre that is often dusty and stilted. This isn't a period piece for people who long to romanticize and reenact the era this is set, this is a period piece that longs to make people relish the absurdity and charm of period pieces.You can find the joy in this eccentric series if you see just how tongue in cheek it is. It's Marie Antoinette by Sophia Coppola reimagined for bingewatching soap loving audiences and it's delightful.",8
Please stop my breathing,Season 1 I think I enjoyed the novelty of it all. The accents. The costumes and set design. The gallantry. The sexual tension in season 2 with the long dramatic pauses had me feeling nauseous.Drivel. I'm sure I could feel myself losing brain cells while watching..,3
This is Actually 'Eloise Bridgerton Show',"Since there are no recent notable period drama airing, Bridgerton is a medicine for this need. It is like a Jane Austen kinda drama mixed with Gossip Girl by a contemporary author. Acting is amazing but the shining star of the series is definitely Eloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie). She's the flavour of the TV series. I can't wait to see her romance story in the future seasons. I am aware that every book is a love story of one of each Bridgerton siblings. The author shows us even that annoying Anthony character deserves love too. Second season is better and more exciting than the first one. Actually the first season is one of the classic period drama love stories. But it is sad to not be able to see the Duke again and sad to hear that Phoebe Dynevor (who plays Daphne Bridgerton) will not reprise her role in season 3. But in both season you may see the marks of 'Pride and Prejudice'. My favorite season is definitely the second season. Apart from the love story of Anthony and Kate (btw Simone Ashley is a perfect choice for the role, I first saw her in Sex Education, she did quite well job there but I did not know that she is such a talented actor. If there was no Eloise Bridgerton, that would be definitely a 'Jonathan Bailey & Simone Ashley show') ; my favorite scene of the second season is absolutely the final episode's final Penelope and Eloise scene. I mean the confrontation scene. This was a remarkable scene of the season, even the entire show. I believe Eloise ran late for this enlightenment. I hope the next seasons preserve this harmony and the fluency.",8
Good storyline,I loved how the two characters portrayed by Phoebe and Page fell in love. You could feel the romance between the two. Let's not forget the romantic scenes that made this movie a sure watch for me.,9
My Love and Confusion,I really enjoyed this series. I thought that the settings and costumes were perfect for the settings. It is it's own little world with some awesome changes. It is not based on our historical world and characters are not based on who they were in our real history.The acting was great and they did really well for the scripts they were given. In season 1 especially Rege-Jean Page (the Duke).If you're looking for a romantic drama (with risqué scenes) this is for you.However I just found that it is based off a book series and read the Duke and I. Which season 1 is loosely based on.I know the writers couldn't focus only on 2 people to make a series worth watching and some of the things they changed or added did really well. But They screwed up on the whole love story and how the characters are supposed to interact with one another and their feelings. I was very disappointed as I feel like the writes failed completely on delivering what could have been a better outcome.Read the books!!Having Read all the books and Queen Charlotte I am confused as to why the writers of this series are screwing up the story and massively skipping parts. Like Book 3 and spilling beans in series 2 that doesn't happen till a decade later.,10
Regency Riot,"What is the matter with you who have written such terrible reviews?
This is creativity at its best! The mad hair and embellished costume design should give you the indication that it isn't even set on this planet but an alternative universe!
It honestly doesn't matter that it's far fetched and surreal - it is funny and well acted, so just sit back and relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery and costumes.",10
Season 2,Ohhhh how I loved this season! The chemistry between the 2 main roles was so believable and I held my breath in many parts! I loved season 1 but this in my opinion is so much better. Can't wait for next season.,10
Bad adaptation,Doesn't do justice to the books and the bad acting didn't help.,1
I LOVE BRIDGERTON,"I LOVED THIS SERIES SO MUCH AND AS A READER OF THE BOOKS, I CAN SAY IT IS AMAZING. Of course, as an adaptation there were scenes that I would like to be in the series, however everything is perfect that I didn't care. I highly recommend this series to everyone, remembering that there are hot scenes there are scenes that make you cry. And despite being a period series, the modernity inserted in it, current songs played in a classical version, everything is perfect. I highly recommend the series to everyone, remembering that there are hot scenes, and there are also scenes that make you cry.",10
"I enjoyed this, the multiracial casting made it somewhat more interesting","I feel like people giving this bad reviews are just sort of freaked out by the casting of black and brown actors as historically caucasian figures. I mean, it was strange at first for me, mainly because I don't expect non-white people to speak in that posh, upperclass way and behave so rigidly as they do in these period dramas. But about halfway through the second episode I found the ""alternative"" casting made the whole thing more interesting to me. The non-white characters just grabbed my attention whenever they were on screen, partially because they're excellent actors and fun to watch (and Regé-Jean Page as the Duke - lordy, MEOW) and I think I also felt the sort of run-of-the-mill plot was elevated somewhat with this added visual element.But to criticise the acting as some did here is ludicrous. The acting is superb, as are the characterisations. The whole thing is a bit unreal, the candy-bright costumes especially give it a sort of fantasy feel. The plot is a bit one-note and simplistic, and I admit I'm not super enthralled with a drama focusing on whether or not certain people will get married, but it was charming, mostly due to the wonderful cast and buoyant direction.As people of that time might say, it's a ""most pleasant diversion"".",8
Magical,"This was a delightful escape from a bad 2020. The story, costumes, actors etc were all very good. As to the comments about race, here's a bit of history for you; Queen Charlotte descended from the black Portuguese Royal line. She was black. Also, during the Regency period there were black aristocrats. Albeit few in number, they did exist. Nevertheless, this is a fictional account of a period in history told from today's rules where color of skin should not matter when it comes to characters in a show. Hamilton paved the way for this and I certainly hope it continues and we move away from typecasting in film.",8
Bridgerton (season 2),"I cannot explain my feelings properly, but I shall try. As you see I've adopted the attitude of the ladies of the series. Shameless, am I? So today we are gonna talk about love. Ok ok, I know it is not so thoughtful of me, but believe me the story in this series is worth knowing. I will not tell it to you, of course! I'm not Lady Whistledown after all, but I can be quite the same. If only we had school newspaper. Sorry, out of the point. I only meant to say that I want to express my full gratitude towards the whole crew of this series. This was a pleasant and very enjoyable experience for two days. Yes, in fact, I waited a year and a half to watch it for 2 days. That's why I am telling you that you will not be wasting your time watching it. You will adopt the feeling of being in their generation and as a part of their journey, I assure you. But if I could be like Lady Whistledown and write gossip for entertaining our pitiful world, I would've. Dreams, dreams aren't we all allowed to have them? We shall see...",10
Love it,"A modern day twist on something which is normally bland, people use your imagination, as this is not your usual casting, it brought colour flare diversity, isn't this what we all want.
The series is brilliant, to the writers well done. You kept me hooked. Roll on series 2",10
AMAZING,"Season 2 ...OMG
without words.It's amazing 👏 😍!!I didn't like season 1 so I gave it up 2 times but in the end I finished it and I was really thinking if I should watch season 2. THANK YOU GOD FOR DOING IT.",9
Just delightful,"Let's do a food metaphor. Great dramas are like gastronomic dishes, subtle and exquisite.
But Bridgerton isn't that. It's more like a cake, it exists to trigger every pleasure receptor in your brain and it does that perfectly, which is why I give it 10/10.",10
"Pressed Much, Guys?","I love this show and I am here for the diverse cast, which apparently has been ruffling the feathers of a lot of viewers. Lets face it, a lot of people have a hard time seeing a person of color cast as anything other than a slave or a servant. I can see the steam coming out of their ears now! Pity.Keep up the wonderful work, Shonda and friends!",10
Much Better than Jane Austin,"Bridgerton surprised me, I started watching expecting some tired old Jane Austin story, but it was good. Well written, terrific acting in all parts, casting did a great job. The costumes were all gorgeous and the sets were just fabulous. I enjoyed this show very much, would like to see more by these writers, maybe another series could be made?",10
Loved it!,"Love, love, loved it. It is fun. The characters are great! It was the perfect Christmas present from Netflix. I think it was my best gift of the year. I can say if you are watching in hopes of seeing other shows maybe this isn't for you. I love Jane Austen movies and downtown abbey. This is not a boring carbon copy of those it is it's own perfect show.",10
Curious to see what the fuss is about,"I feel that not since ' Gone With The Wind ' has a screened entertainment had so much fuss, and after seeing a few episodes I found its triviality pitiful and its rather camp content much ado about nothing. Yes, the diversity of casting is good in itself, but I believe acting quality comes first and that Rege-Jean Page though good to look at gives a perfunctory performance. The other lead Phoebe Dynevor is equal in pallid delivery and has very little charisma. The plot so far relies heavily on ' Pride and Prejudice ' elements, and that is tedious, especially when women start flocking around Page as if he is some kind of god. The other actors ( or some of them ) are better. Jonathan Bailey on the acting level is head and shoulders above Rege-Jean Page and Adjoah Andah steals every scene she is in. The title Bridgerton is so close to Sanditon for comfort, and I just wish Jane Austen was here to pass comment. As for the direction the less said the better, but a 4 for Bailey in a powerful role and some good lines, and for the diversity of casting.",4
I'm a fan of the genre and I liked this,"Beautiful set and costume design. I've not read the book(s) so my review doesn't carry that baggage. I like the diverse casting; no need to see Whitey McWhiteypants having all the fun. The feminist honking is a little over-the-top. Hard to listen to the 1%, male or female, whining so loudly. Worth watching, but have a phone on hand to distract during the cringe moments.",8
Perfectly ideal!,"Perfectly ideal!Recently, I have finished watching of the most provoking and very bold TV-show of the beginning 2021 ""Bridgerton"" and that is my opinion.It was brilliant, perfectly ideal form the first minutes of the show, quickly catching the attention of the audience, exciting from the first shots, admirable from the first sight, newly, lightly, fresh like a breath of fresh air. It seems to me that this project is what we need most now, the project that is broken the stereotypes of old costume movie.I can't explain to myself why the cast of the show raised the wave of protest and misunderstanding because in my view there was the great spice of the show inviting to the starring roles the black actors. The actor's game the next characters like the Duke of Hastings, Lady Danbury, Marina Thomson, Will Mondrich and others did great, was off the charts. At the end of the show all the characters became so close friends to me that I can't highlight the most bright and memorable performance.Firstly, my attention was attracted be the hero of Violet - the mother of the great and shockingly prolific Bridgerton family. Because as I see the mother of such huge and friendly family should be like her in the show. She is kind, understanding, intelligent, a little bit nervous if it is about her children, and she knows how to find an approach to each of her children except may be Eloise. Nevertheless, I am absolutely sure that she will make out her in further seasons and help her to find her place in a high society.My second love is Rege-Page who performed the starring role of the Duke of Hastings. Yes, he is lovely handsome, he is fantastically handsome. It is very hard to take eyes off the screen when he has appeared. He is gentle, charming, with good manners, long neck, pleasant countenance, great professional and profound actor. At the beginning, it was strange to me how the hero with so sad, unhappy childhood, abandoned by his own father, could grow up and turn in such mature, confident and honorable person. But sometimes the miracles can happen.At the show we get acquainted with different type of noble family, Bridgerton, Featherington, Cowper and others. Despite the fact that main family proclaimed the postulates of the flawless and traditional life without brothels, gambling, bets, betrayals, was Bridgerton, my favourite family was Featherington.May be it has been explained that they are not so perfect, interesting and ideal like Bridgerton and by this reason more close to real life, may be because they are more bright, jolly, direct. Obviously, that beautiful fresh Daphne sooner or later will be engaged to the prince, duke, viscount or someone noble and wonderful person. But how to get married a less beautiful daughters one of which is a little bit fat and others are not very pretty? Especially, without rich dowry. This is a challenge for stand-out character of Portia Featherington.All Featherington family is bright, colored, brave, distinguished from calm honorable and noble Bridgerton that is living without defect. They are ridiculous at some moments of the show, but in my view they are not vulgar, frankly ignorant in spite of their green-yellow-pink clothes and not very noble actions.It is much sorrowful watching the unrequited Penelope's love to Colin Bridgerton and her sufferings about him. He has been looking at her only at a friend, but maybe the storyline get continued on other season.The character of Portia Featherington is significant for the story, because she is a real head of this family, and there are many goals raising in front of her: how to marry daughters that is not very beautiful or well-mannered and at the end of the narration they staying without any dowry and money.; how to rid of the shame relating with Marina Thomson, how to help her unfortunate husband paying off a debt to the creditors. All od these matters has fallen on the shoulders of the woman.What can I say as a resume: I will be waiting for new seasons that as Netflix promised will be 4. Not the less.",10
I feel Like it is a remake over gossip girl,It is Gossip girl in a parallel universe. I like it! It is for those of us who like romance and Prince Charming stories! The first season was so juicey as it had the perfect lead actor ... such handsome man... I recommend it to be watched by romance lovers :),10
Brilliant loved it!,I cannot understand why so many people put bad reviews up about this. Ignore!Definitely give this a go. I wasn't sure in episode 1 if it was for me but then I started to hooked in. Very well done and great cast. Few familiar faces from UK dramas etc like Polly Walker. Can't wait for season 2.,10
A perfect definition for happy fairytale,"If you like reading romantic fairytales with happy endings then watch this.If you prefer historical accuracy with logical reasoning, then this is not for you.",9
"Enthralling, captivating & delicious","This came up in my ""recommended for you"" list a couple of times, but did not capture my attention. I love period dramas and so yesterday I decided to embark on the series. Captured my attention immediately and held it through the entire series. The storytelling is enjoyable and none of the stories are too laboured, but there is sufficient character development to have you invested. A definite 10 out of 10!!!!!!",10
Great show!,"It's perfect! I really can't understand why some people are so angry for black actors they're playing white characters. When the contrary happens, don't have all this commotion. I think there's a word for that, right?",10
Great show,Binged watched in 2 days - i really hope season 2 comes out soon,10
Entertaining,"A fairy-telling, bright and beautiful piece of work. I look forward to the next season.",10
Season 2 - 8/10,"I found myself enjoying season 2 much more than season 1, there was more humour, relatable and I didn't think I would like Anthony as much as I did but him and Kate with that slow burn - YES! Kate is good as well. Eloise storyline was also really good and I loved the evolvement of her. Hope to see more Anthony and Kate and more of the Bridgeton family. I didn't miss Phoebe or Reges characters tbh. I thought I would.",8
Just stay away,"Wondering how the overall rating is 7.3! It must be 3.7 at most... There is fast-food and it seems now there is fast-series. The same crap. Tasteless, just colors. I wonder how one can compare this piece of (%^%^) with Downton Abbey.",1
"Engaging, fantastic and wonderful.",Bridgerton was really a welcome surprise this Christmas. It is much more than you can expect. Watch and be amazed by the most fertile family in high society.,10
Great show,"A lovely indulgence show. Enjoyed every moment. Every single one of the actors was so attractive, I literally could not tear my eyes away from the screen.",10
As a POC...,I am absolutely enthralled by this period drama that makes me feel as if we could have had a beautiful world in which color was as natural as being a human.,10
Scrumdiddlyumptious,"Bridgerton was an delicious dreamy Christmas treat! It was such a fun and totally sexy show to watch! The costumes, sets, music and acting were delightful escapism fitting for the last week of a challenging year.I was not a long time fan of the book series but read them once I saw the preview for this show. I started reading romance for distraction and comfort during the pandemic and was excited to see a romance novel used as a source material for tv! Just like all romance novels the plots of the Bridgerton book series and first season of the show are predictable and formulaic but comforting at the same time. You know there's going to be problems but things will come together in the end. Don't come looking to find a shocking unexpected plot. That being said you will find characters with depth and beautiful stories about love, vulnerability, and family. I was happy with the adaptation of the characters and the changes they made to the plot.I'm disappointed with the negative reviews regarding the diverse casting. I understand the need to be aware of not erasing history but that's not what's going on here. Bridgerton is a fantastical 21st century romance story set in the 19th century. It's refreshing to have black actors cast in a period piece. It's refreshing the see Rege-Jean Page play a duke in a romantic lead. I never got the feeling that Bridgerton was trying to do anything but provide a romance with representation. All the haters need to get over it and really look into their hearts at why a black duke in a fictional story bothers them so much.Winners:
-Anthony: Jonathan Bailey was the best actor of the ensemble in my opinion. Fans of the books might be disappointed in how Anthony struggles in the show but I think they gave Anthony's character so much room to grow.
-Eloise: she was a joy and even more fun than in the books. She provided as space for feminist critique of the restrictions of their society.
The actors had amazing chemistry and it showed!Criticisms:
Don't be mad... I loved it and can still have critiques...
-The diversity was amazing but I did notice that almost all of the black actresses were light-skinned and there were very few dark-skinned actresses with speaking lines. If you're going to have a diverse cast it might be a good idea to be a bit more conscious of that.
It didn't go unnoticed that they chose to cast a black woman for the role of Marina, one of the only tragic storylines from the series, and they expanded it with an secret pregnancy! If you know the books you know her story is not a happy one. Just a bit disappointing to add a black character that doesn't get to have a happy ending like everyone else.Consent. I was wondering if they were going to change the Daphne/Simon conflict in the show but it was even more glossed over and downplayed. I felt like they could have done a better job at addressing consent and trust in Simon and Daphne's relationship.Overall I loved it even with its flaws. You should watch it if you are looking for a pretty romantic drama.",9
Gossip Girl meets Jane Austen,"I watched this in a matter of hours, I absolutely loved it and the books",9
Sooooooo very loosely based on book.,"Honestly, if you really enjoyed the books. Don't watch this. This was made for the Twitter bio lovers.",3
So entertaining.,It was so entertaining and fun to watch with all bright dresses and with a totally different area and diversity just loved it. It also has a very good and cute story.,10
Sexy fun and swoon worthy!,"So much fun. Sexy, scandalous, and so much fun to watch. Most haters are upset with the diversity, so ignore those reviews. I was initially disappointed with season two, because there was a lot less sexy scenes. But the tension is what makes it so sexy, and so fun. A really enjoyable watch.",8
Great series.,"The perfect mix of glamour, intrigues, beautiful decors, dresses, gossip, romance, sex and love in a patriarch society where the woman are the strongest.
These days people are not used to see acts of love, and sexuality (therefore many give a low rating) is for many people more difficult to see compared to acts of violence, but rest assured. The sex is passionate but not explicit and suitable for all ages.
It's a typical historical romance novel adapted to the screen and it's perfectly done. The performances are strong. I would love to see more.",9
Good watch,If you are smart enough to know this is fiction and accept diversity you might enjoy this.,8
Outstanding,I really loved this series it was like watching a romance novel on screen and the guy that plays the Duke he is scorching the writing was phenomenal and the acting on point,10
Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this and it is indeed visually stunning, but for me it failed in so many ways. I didn't mind historical inaccuracies, what period drama doesn't have its fair share, but I disliked the oh so predictable story lines, the what comes across as an attempt to be Jane Austenish on the one hand and then incorporate 21st century attitudes on the other, not really sure what it was trying to be. My favourite character was the Queen, loved her which is why I give it 5 stars.",5
"Lovely, never claimed historical accuracy","Baffling that no one bothers to look up any actual history when claiming a drama and romance that never claimed to be historically accurate wasn't just that. Queen Charlotte likely was born of African and Portuguese descent if anyone cares to find it. Clearly from her portraits, she wasn't white so it's not so far-fetched there could be other royals descended from other moors and the like. Even if not, slavery wasn't that visible in the UK. Not like America. They weren't picking cotton in England. They used slaves in their other colonies where they had money in sugar cane and spices etc. But if you're that bent out of shape over the mixed race casting or that it's not like the books or that they mix in string quartet versions of pop songs, it's called creative license. Stop whining or having purist ideas of what this should be. The rest of us are enjoying a bit of escapism - yes what is essentially Gossip Girl in an Austen novel - during quarantine and this garbage year. If that's not your thing, no one is stopping you from watching something else.",8
Brilliant!!!,I don't know what everyone is complaining about. As a black woman I enjoy the diversity of the show. People really show their TRUE COLORS when shows like this are made. Quit your belly aching and deal with it. Kudos to Ms. Shonda Rhimes. I cannot wait for season 2!!,10
Fantastic,"My god...I adore everything about this...Literally everything. And I've only seen 2 episodes. But...I know, because it's Shonda...that this will not only, never disappoint, but I'll be desperate for more...",10
Diversity matters!,"To evaluate a highly produced series with 1-2 stars just because there are black characters is RACISM
where is your sense? black people exist and deserve to be portrayed equally to whites in cinematographic works, there is no use ignoring
and about the ""excuse"" of the time, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD IS A FICTIC SERIES, THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS TO BE A REQUIREMENT FOR ONLY WHITE PEOPLE IN THE CAST",9
Utterly superb in every way.,"Brilliant. Could not stop watching the episodes...bingeworthy. Cannot wait for a second series. Stunning costumes. Great, fun plotline. Well acted by all.
Absolutely LOVE this.",10
What a shame,"This is ridiculous! The acting is barely okay, it's superficial, the mix of ages doesn't work for me! Maroon 5 or Billie Ellish have nothing to do in a ballroom in the 17th century. Some rules have to be respected to be true to period dramas. I had great expectations but....",1
A Diamond of the First Water,I've seen numerous book adaptations over the years and none have been so well done as Bridgerton. It follows Julia Quinn's books so closely while also adding some changes that seamlessly fit with the story. The cast is impeccable and the flow of events is perfect; not a moment of boredom. I look forward to many more seasons as we get to see the stories of each of the siblings.,10
Perfect escapism!,"Fantastical soap opera period piece.
The diverse cast is utterly swoon-worthy. I also appreciate all the new faces - none bring prior characters they're known for to this story.
I'm keeping fingers-crossed that there's more seasons to come (apparently the book series are 8 in total - one for each Bridgeton sibling).
Aside from the main characters, I really enjoyed Eloise played by Claudia Jessie.",10
Escapism at its finest!,"I'm a huge history buff as well as a lover of all things English. The first episode caught me off guard and I wasn't sure if I could wrap my head around the concept (I'm not familiar with the books) and casting. But as the series went on, I actually fell in love with the pure fantasy/uniqueness of it. The chemistry and smoldering attraction between Daphne and Simon was almost as good as Claire and Jamie (if you know, you know)! Anyway, is it historically factual? Absolutely not. But sometimes it's good to let go and enjoy a fun period piece with no expectations.",10
Prefer the 2nd season,"Although the 1st season was very good, I much prefer the 2nd. Less gratuitous sex scenes. I found it a little over done in the first season. Enjoying the story in the 2nd season.",10
2nd best,"The second season was so much better than the first one! Much more detail into the characters, still, i wish they would make more eps per season, the finale felt a little bit rushed but i love it!",10
Unbelievably bad.,"So, we have a Duke and a Duchess.
One white one tan.
Deceiving their families and friends.
Firstborn son named A*****Real or Rubbish, difficult to tell, if one can be bothered.
Real is a ridiculous charade for attention (read money)
Rubbish is well eight hours of ones life squandered.Miss Austen would be much amused that $Ms and a cast of thousands cannot come even close to her genius, created on a small table in two-up-two-down modest houses.Netflix, try harder and stop hiring poseurs who's only talent is to pirate and plagiarize their betters.Even the weather is a phony.",1
Amazing adaptation,"I usually dont like the adaptations of books, this one though is an exeption. I loved that the first season set up information for the other characters, evwn more that the first book did. Specially loved the George-Marina-Philip subplot.",10
Great entertainment,"I don't think Bridgerton is supposed to be taken seriously. It is however beautifully entertaining, especially for the gorgeous costumes, dancing, music, lovely lead stars and the romance. There is so much to enjoy that it fully makes up for any slight flaws/excess. Super.",10
A cute love story,"The best things about this movie is the sets, the outfits and scenes of the period drama. Beautiful acting by all the characters and awesome chemistry between the lead actors. The queen's gowns deserve a special mention. An excellent story line to keep us engrossed all through the series. Am eagerly waiting for Season 2.",10
Modern and fun!,I enjoyed watching it! It's fun and entertaining. It's not really history so don't watch it if you expect it to be that.,8
Perfection!!!,The cast is perfect!!! We can see representativeness and diversity and this is amazing!!!COLORFUL BRIDGERTON,10
1st season: very good; 2nd season; bad soap opera,"I really liked the first season. The atmosphere was an intensified English historical drama, with all the right ingredients: clever banter, love, drama, high stakes, character building and an intriguing narrator who was an integral part of the plot. I looked forward to season 2, but then....Second season. Yeesh. What a difference. The Bridgerton format seems to be the start of each year's series of balls and soirees designed to match eligible gentlemen and ladies. I suspect that each season will focus on a member of the Bridgerton family. Season one was about the oldest girl, Daphne, and season two was about Anthony, the oldest son and Viscount. Fine. Some of the good from the first season was still there, the clever family banter, and Eloise, the middle Bridgerton sister, whose personality was delightfully quirky for the most part, but the rest was dreck.The main love interests were so illogical, dense and obstinate -- especially Kat -- it made them impossible to relate to, and it was slow -- painful, irrational and endless, with repetitive and often contradictory conversations on responsibility and finding one's ""true self"" -- slow. When the inevitable happened, I didn't care anymore.This snoozefest was determined to last eight hours regardless. To fill it out somewhat, they had a pointless sideline with Eloise and a printer boy, a silly side order of fraud with the Featherington family, and a dose of feminism. If season two did anything, it made all the main characters from season one less likeable. I won't be watching season three.",2
Love it!,"Bridgerton is a delight.
I hope they make many more seasons. The sets and costumes are amazing. The actors are great. I love Shonda Rhimes production of Julia Quinn's book.",10
Amazing (and Im also a fan of the books!),"The serie is not like the book, but I attempted to say it's even better.
The adaptation is there, with some differences from the book, but all the vibe, romance, drama and even funny parts are all over the place in so many beautiful ways to explore it.
As a fan of the books, I felt excitement, sadness, joyful and the most important in a romantic piece of art: I fell in love with everything. The music is spectacular! The cast choice is just perfect.Loved it so much.
Cant wait for the next season to watch Antony's story on screen.",10
I was investeddd,"I mean, season two is even better. I know, there is no Duke. But the romance between the two main leads is sizzling. It is intense and I can't stop thinking about it.Everything else works too. It is funny, there is drama, and the music still does it.Yes, I gave it a 10/10. Still riding the wave of excitement.",10
Amazing,"Amazing, this serie is the best
I like this
I like history
I love everything and I agree a second seasson, for yesterday, pls",10
Amazing,"I was so excited to the series and I really loved the outcome, I just can't be more happy, the actors was a perfect, I just can't describe in word my happiness",9
Wow this sucks.,"What has the world come to, this is beyond cringe. Bad acting, bad writing, and boring. Nothing but a cheesy interracial fest in regency clothes.I don't want to waste any more time reviewing this crap show but it's telling me I need 150 characters.",1
Really enjoyed,I really enjoyed this series!! I didn't read the books so I didn't really care that it doesn't follow them exactly. Oh and I have an open mind so I didn't really care that there was a black queen in that time period. Geez people!!,10
Epic Masterpiece,The show brought Julia Quinn's characters to life. Each and every person is tailor made for their roles. I don't think I can wait an year for season 2. So @Netflix@chrisvandusan @Shondaland please hurry.,9
BEST SHOW IN A WHILE!!!,"It's funny, entertaining, AND sexxxxyyyy! Loved it so much I watched it 3 times already and it's only been out like two weeks. This is a must watch show! For all the people saying they only watched 15-20 minutes and had to stop, shame on you!",10
10/10 best series in 2020 so far,"I can't wait for more I'm obsesses, i know it is probably not for all people who read the book just give it a try it won't hurt",10
Love it!!,I absolutely adore it and so does every one I know that has watched it! MORE!!!!!,10
Awful!,"Ery disappointed. bad acting and the actors are totally devoid of presence and charm. therefore, there is no chemistry, there is no passion, there is no beauty. everything very badly done, it seems that I am watching an open TV show for teenagers. ridiculous",1
Simply perfect,I loved the series. The representation was fantastic and very important to construct a better world.,10
Season 2 is perfection,Season 1 now looking at it was mid compared to season 2 was done so well so perfect everything felt so right !!! Can't wait for season 3 and on hopefully gets better as it did from season 1 to 2.,10
Binge worthy!,Totally binge worthy! I loved the diversity and the excellent actors they chose! Watched the whole season in 1 day and really hoping for more soon!,10
Why should you watch it ?,It is simple if you wanna escape the harsh world we in it even if it is as temporary and short as 8 hours it will do the job and do it perfectly.,10
Obsessed,I can't get enough!! I really hope they make the entire series. I love everything about it.,10
Waste of Time,"I couldn't even watch the first episode. I've read the whole series of novels and loved them. This show is nothing like the novels and I'm embarrassed for the author of said novels, I guess money trumped her hard work....the acting is just so bad and it is all wrong when it comes to the Regency period. The manners, the gaudy dress....just no.",1
Delightful,"This didn't start out as something I thought I'd like, but it proved to be a nice escape. It was well-acted, a fun and tantalizing story line. The period love story was engaging and fun to watch. I love the period costumes and the ostentatiousness. More should believe in love.",9
Loved it. a romantic fantasy,"I have not read the books nor need to . I binged watched the series, and couldn't turn it off. Loved the characters, loved the costumes, and enjoyed the story. It was an entertaining period piece and I loved it.",10
"Reminds me of Choices, if you know you know","Starting the series I was not expecting much. From the first episode I got this feeling of watching Choices live action, it was very bland but as the episodes were going it got very addictive. The characters gained a lot more depth and relatability. If you want to see a romance - funny at times- series then this is for you. It isn't anything groundbreaking and don't expect you'll see the world differently after watching it but it is surely an enjoyable series to get you through quarantine.",8
Really enjoyable and easy to watch,I loved this. Watched it all on Boxing Day. The characters are all really well done. The acting can be bit over the top but I think that's the point. I don't know what all of the bad reviews are about because I thought it was great.,9
I love,"I feel like I'm the same and even better than books, I'm in love with the characters.",10
"Oh, dear...","Drivel. Opening scenes looked promising. Lavish, expensive and colourful. Rapidly descended into garbage.It's like whoever produced it (Netflix) was so excited about learning the ""cute way"" people spoke in 1830's London Society, that any old script would suffice.Avoid.",1
Very intertaining,"It has drama, romance and a great plotline definitely a must watch totally recommend",9
An inclusive royalty and beautiful casting,"I'm really in much more love with the series. Is very inclusive to all the races and the chances were better for the ""tv formats"". Hopefully we'll have asians on the royalty soon too",8
Loved every minute,"This was just beautiful. From the costumes to the sets to the cast to the script. It was just one of those series, you know the ones I'm talking about, when you've watched the last of the episodes and you're sad that it's over. I wasn't concerned with who was in what role, why they shouldn't be in that role nor any historical accuracy issues. I just loved it for being the story it was. Beautiful.As a side note, I just want to know what happened to the diamond necklace that the Prince had given to Daphne. She took it off when she was on the bridge and that is the last we heard or saw of it. We were distracted when Simon followed her into the garden right after. BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NECKLACE? :O",10
Perfeição!!!,"I found the perfect series, the chemistry of the main couple is incredible ...",10
Well executed romantic fairy tale - love it,"From the reviews its clear either you'll love it or you'll hate it.Its not period drama, not historical documentary as many critics here tries to imply and evaluates accordingly.It's romantic drama with very good budget. I love season 2 even more, because of the great chemistry main actors share.I read the books and i'm not bothered that plot was changed. New approach made more sense than some scenes in the books.I guess this show is more for people that experienced love and knows the ""feeling"".",10
"Season 1 was great, Season 2 a disaster","2 stars for some good acting, like for example Anthony and Penelope. But OMG what a waste of time season 2 was!!! It should have been at least 4 episodes shorter. The main story was so cringe...I think season 2 was bad also because Kate was completely miscast. Simon Hastings was also portrayed by a black actor but he was behaving like an english aristocrat and he showed feelings!! This is the problem of season 2. Both Edwina and especially Kate were behaving like foreigners and I could not believe why Anthony who was looking for a woman like him fell in love Kate Sharma = an idian woman behaving like one. It was really dearing to cast 2 black women to play 2 aristocratic english women in the 19th century, but to make them behave like foreigners was too much for me...The romance between the Indian Kate and the Englishman Anthony did not convince me at all. They had no chemistry probably because she had a stoned face and a fake smile most of the time. Why on earth did they choose this actress?? And why are people saying she did a great job?So I felt that the whole season 2 was like a satire because of the historical inaccuracy. It's like making a movie about Nelson Mandela and casting a white actor to play the main character. That' how off the casting for Kate and Edwina felt to me...Also Eloise was extremly annoying and she was behaving like a young bored chic from our time. The only character I was really interested in was Penelope.",2
Amazing show,"Amazing show. The performances from everyone were exceptional. The chemistry between Simon and Daphne is beautiful.
Can not wait for season 2",10
Well worth a watch,"Loved it, beautiful costumes and houses .great acting would definitely recommend",10
This show brought me back to life after a terrible year,"I was quite ill when this show came out ; only heard about it during the 2nd week of January . So there I was lying in bed watching tv and I got so swept away ,it really took my mind of my troubles. The casting was brilliant , I wasn't expecting it to be so diverse and I didn't watch it for the diversity but it made the show that much more enjoyable. Cant wait for season 2!!!",10
Amazing just amazing!!!,Amazing just amazing!!! This serie needs continuation,10
I felt very represented,In my opinion the best series ever created! The representativeness that the series brought is incredible. I'm in love and looking forward to the second season!,10
A total abomination,"Nothing destroys a period piece worse than production not having done it's due diligence and research. Don't think I made it through the first episode as the clothing/costumes were sloppy, off era and cheap. Did I see a pair of spiked heals when a hem kicked up? The jewelry was 1950-60s junk costume. As a civil war reenactor and costume reproducer from the 1700s - 1960s and collector of most I have zero tolerance for millennials feeble attempts at costuming. There's no absolutely no excuse. READ A BOOK. Geez like I haven't made my point and I'm required to embellish on a series that is still available on streaming that shouldn't have made it past the cutting room floor? Your definitely gluttons for punishment, I guess. So if you want me to give examples to follow, Downton Abby and Sisi:Austrian Empress are good places to start other than to the best if my knowledge they hadn't designed gowns with crumb catchers in the early 1800s, but I'll let them look that one up. The story line can't pull this one out either.",1
Good show. Loved it.,"Funny, mind relaxing, filled with emotions, bright colors, nice soundtrack.
I would recommend this show to anybody looking for something to relax and enjoy a weekend off.
Me and my husband watched it together and both enjoyed it very much, and he is definitely not a type for this genre of the show.
Loved the characters, music, costumes.
Show is all fictions and has noting to do with history facts but very entrtaining.",10
I truly don't understand the low reviews,"It's a good show with good acting, believable chemistry between Daphne and Simon, funny and enjoyable.And the costumes!!!What I don't like it's rewriting history for politically correct purposes.",8
Delightful! Also a good read,"If you haven't read the books, you simply must! Julia Quinn is a genius at making romance novels not just romantic, but hilarious, charming, and addicting. The series is wonderful too although there are certain liberties taken (as there always are when taking a book to the screen). It's binge worthy for sure!",10
Highly recommend,Highly recommend watching!! I've binged watch season one and cannot wait for more!!!!!,8
Silly Fun,This show is awesome! The cast diversity and the overacting is an absolute delight! It reminds me of soap operas in late 80s-90s. Love it! Watch and enjoy',8
Worst thing I've ever seen,"Every actor/actress overacts every scene and it is frankly frustrating. Perhaps ""frustrating"" is not the right word, perhaps the right word is ""rage-inducing"". The story is as predictable as the the sun rising in the morning and with the terrible acting, it adds up to a nauseating concoction that should have just been left on the shelf at Netflix.
If possible I would have given this 0 stars.",1
Entertaining and Wonderful!,"I thought this show was a lot of fun! I wasn't expecting reality or biographical accuracy at all so I appreciated the whimisical costumes and hair. The archaic dialogue was executed well by the wonderful cast. Just as Hamilton was not ""racially accurate"", Bridgerton follows in its brilliant footsteps to push the boundaries of diversity and include all people of all colors to fill a variety of roles in this entertaining series!
It was also surprisingly refreshing to watch something set in such a different time. This is an innocent and old-fashioned exploration of romance and sex, i.e. not for the prudes. Otherwise, give it a go!",8
Great show!,Loved the book series and very pleased with the show!,10
Loved this show,Couldn't stop watching. Loved the romans and story and it the story has some twists and turns I wasn't expecting. Soooo good!!!,10
Perfect,The series is amazing and the characters are wonderful. I'm in love with the Duke,10
Cross between Pride and Prejudice and A Knight's Tale,Very engaging storyline and characters. The clothing is gorgeous.,8
In a world far far away,This series is as inaccurate as it can be an not corresponding with reality whatsoever. Closer to a fairytale than to a historical drama. Especially the fact that this series is politically correct in ways this time period was absolutely not. This makes the series odd.,1
TV Show for Relaxation,"Season 1 deserves 10, very soapy season 2 - only 6. At last we have TV Show that it is a Show, : lovely, entertaining, fantastic and spectacular. In first season, script writers did a very good job and the main cast is just perfect.",8
Give me more!,"This was such a delight. Stellar acting and casting, the soundtrack, the story, EVERYTHING! Netflix and Shondaland are a match that can't be beat. I will be anxiously awaiting a second season!",10
Exactly What I Wanted It To Be,I'm too thrilled by the show to make criticisms. I loved the casting. Loved the sets and costumes. Loved that they kept to the essence and spirit of the books. Loved that each episode felt long enough. Loved Pen and Eloise. Love. Love. Love.The only thing I would have liked to see more was more LOL wit that Julia Quinn is so good at.I want more seasons. I want ALL the seasons.,10
"It's just a bit of fun, not a documentary","No idea why this is upsetting people. At first I thought it was great casting, just using actors regardless of their heritage. Then I realised they made a subtle change to the plot and I think it's a great one. It never claims to be historically accurate - it's based on a romance novel people! I can't wait for the next series.",10
Success!!,I think season 2 is much better than season 1! It's very elaborate in presentation and thoroughly entertaining. Good storyline with good standard of acting. Nice to see continuity of characters too.,9
Season 2 not a winner,"Season one was great. The story in season two was great, but the actors just couldn't deliver it. It seems to be lacking some of the excess drama or sun plots of season 1. And the actress who played Kate felt absolutely lifeless and one dimensional. Always sad when this happens to a promising series.",2
This was a great series,"So in my opinion and yes everyone is entitled to their own, but I rather enjoyed the series and could not stop watching. If you do not agree that's fine, but do not come after me for enjoying this series.",10
Get over it. It's meant to be escapism not a historically accurate period piece,"Remember when we used to like watching soap operas and sweeping romantic mini series? Thank you Bridgerton for bringing back the addictive romance and fun. People whining about diversity and historical accuracy are completely missing the point. The show doesn't claim to be something it's not. Shondaland knoes exactly what it's doing and they are filling a huge hole that hasn't been filled for decades. Sometimes we just want to be entertained.I'm a huge fan on the Bridgerton series. For years I've wanted a film adaptation but a series is even better. The books are obviously better but they've done a great job of capturing Julia Quinn's wit, charm and romance. It's not a perfect show but it's perfect if you're looking for some feel-good escapism. Daphne and Simon's love story isn't the best of the series so it's only going to get better from here. Can't wait for the other siblings to get their stories.",10
BRILLIANT SHOW,"I don't understand why people are mad that this show have diversity when its is period drama that is base off of a regency romance fiction book. The keyword is fiction which mean that it can be whatever you want it to be. There are TONS of period drama that stars NOTHING, but white people so me being a person of color and seeing one that have people like me in a staring role is a AWESOME feeling. I hope that the show creator Chris Van Dusen keep up the good work by adding more diversity into this genre, not just only in the background characters, but also with the main characters( ie. Anthony love interest Kate, and Benedict love interest Sophie), and other major characters that are introduce in later books. The cast of the show were amazing and everyone desever their applause, definitely love the chemistry between the main two leads, and as someone who read the books they are just how I imagine Daphne and Simon. The sets were BEAUTIFUL and actually made me wish I could visit a place like that for real. There were moments that things just felt predictable, but than again that is all apart of the genre. My only advice would be NEVER go full WATTPAD this season went full WATTPAD, if you read wattpad you know what I mean.",8
Incrível,"Amei a adaptação e como é inclusiva!
Os irmãos da Daphne são super carismáticos e o casal Daphmon possuem uma ótima química.",10
Where is your Spoiler alert ! ?,"I thoroughly enjoyed this but was so disappointed to see Kate listed as Lady Kate Bridgerton when looking at the cast list after only watching 2 episodes of series 2
Where is your spoiler alert ?They aren't even married yet but it ruined my enjoyment
The tension of whether the wedding would go ahead was ruined
When Kate fell off the horse, would she live or die ? Oh wait she will be Lady Bridgerton so must be ok
Thanks IMDB !",10
Shondaland ruins again,"The story had great possibilities. I've watched several seasons of Grey's Anatomy and therefore have an idea of what Shonda Rhimes seems to enjoy putting in her shows. Because of this and the fact that Netflix doesn't seem to be controlled the way television networks are so Shonda Rhimes could put in ALL of her disgusting ideas into this show, I wasn't planning on watching it. I finally decided to give it a shot because I love regency romance. Like many I didn't approve of changing the races of people who were real people in history who actually lived and had their own personalities and who are not how they're being pictured here; not just a change of color but from what I've read of Queen Charlotte, a change of personality. Normally I don't have an issue with creating a diverse cast, but as with many of Shonda Rhimes' work, she seems to be obsessed solely by the black and white races. Also her idea of a diverse cast was to just throw in a few black people here and there and call it a day. I'm still wondering how black Queen Charlotte has a white, blond haired, blue eyed nephew, unless he's really the King's nephew but if I remember my research correctly, he is the Queen's nephew. I was also disgusted with the filth in this show. Showing actual sex scenes and describing other things that have no real place in a tv show is horrible, but as I've said, Shonda Rhimes appears to be obsessed with throwing in some black people here and there, throwing in a ton of sex and masturbation as well as dissolute parties such as the one that the artists enjoy, I really should have expected all this. Grey's Anatomy has plenty of this stuff but it is at least controlled some by tv regulations. I shouldn't have been surprised that that woman would throw in the complete dissolution of morals and integrity that she has. Otherwise some of the characters are okay but I do agree that many have no real character. Honestly the only two who truly have character are Lady Featherington and Penelope Featherington. Lady Featherington is not always pleasant but she is determined. Penelope is a kind person whom you can truly feel bad for when her heart is breaking over Colin Bridgerton.",1
And the stars of the show are.....,"1. The Fashion Accessories - the utterly amazing wigs on the queen, the hats and feathers and jewelry and hairstyles. All emmy worthy!2. The Fashions - Especially those for Polly Walker, gorgeous jewel-toned brocades accessorized with the wonderful feathers and jewels.3. The Music - Early baroque music translations of pop songs - brilliant and fun.4. The Stars - shoutout to Claudia Jessie especially - a delight to watch her act with her physical comedy stylings.",8
Perfect guilty pleasure,"I had many doubts when starting this series including my distaste for period pieces. However, I was quickly caught up in the sheer fun of it all. I binged all 8 episodes in a couple of days and really enjoyed the intensity of the love affair. It may be smut, but it's a fun ride. Everyone is watching this for good reason!",9
Complete rubbish but absolutely amazing!,"I created this IMDB profile to review this series. Lots of folk chatting about it being too woke got me going. To be honest it has a million historical flaws, it inaccurately portrays the period so badly that one almost can imagine a vauxhall corsa coming round the Royal crescent to pick up the characters. It is still an amazing watch which I thoroughly enjoyed. For those that go on about the actors being the wrong shade of pink, please get over yourselves and watch it for what it is... beautiful, perfect escapism. Loved the black queen she was fierce and majestic, the ""English roses"" were very good at swooning, the leading man dashing, there was amazingly camp slapping and prancing. What more does one need during lockdown???Please watch this for what it is... not what it should be! If you need historical accuracy, watch a documentary instead. If you enjoy a slightly camp romp with lots of costume and intrigue, then pour yourself a gin and enjoy it.",10
Perfection in the form of a series!,"It was so rewarding to watch this show, with this spectacularly amazing and charming cast. Rege Jean as Simon was amazing, it looked like he was born specifically for this role, it was extremely satisfying to see him. Not to mention Nicola's perfect performance with Penélope, it was lovely.",10
Sucks me in!,"I have re watched season 1 and season 2 twice now on Netflix! Although I do miss Simon, I can't wait for a Season 3. The time frame, the drama, I am sucked into it all! Will the Queen indeed try to match Edwina with another suitor? Will there be reconciles? There is so much more I want to see.",10
AN ABSOLUTE BORE,"I got through the whole series in about 2 hours. Absolutely boring...... most of the story takes place at dances. The acting is atrocious by people who obviously did study how people reacted and were in those days. Even what sex was in it was pathetic. In the first episode it's like, look at my stunning body and my muscles. Another flop from Netflix.",1
Worth Watching,"Honestly, right off the bat, they should have put this as a fantasy fiction and not historical since it really wasn't accurate of the times. It is a good show and the characters are good. I binge watched this show in one day. I had to know what happened next. Eloise was probably my favorite character because she didn't want to follow what her family wanted her to do and be. I didn't even know this was a book series. I plan on reading the books and then forming another opinion since I can't compare them right now. I would definitely watch this and just enjoy it for what it is and not for historical purposes.",10
Enjoyable...even if it doesn't follow book exactly,"Things I liked- costumes, sets, mama bridgerton, Eloise, the Duke is hot, Marina change up and seeing Sir Philip early, musicThings I didn't like- Papa Feathertons arc and the queens arc...both didn't add much to the story. And revealing the identity of Whistledown too early.....it should of been cut considering the series was renewed before it even premiered.Something interesting- you see the bee throughout the series but no mention of its significance...",9
Far better than everybody is saying,"Yes, it will not win a golden globe or something like that. But it's a really great show. If you are not a snob or entitled, you will enjoy it!",9
"Beautiful, sexy and delightful","If you enjoy period pieces like Downton, Poldark and the Tudors, here is a new treat for you. The costumes are incredible. The mix of modern in the music and cast is refreshing. I don't really understand all the haters leaving comments. I see different women all day for my job and discuss shows and everyone absolutely has loved it. Took a few episodes for it to get steamy - but it's called character building :)
If you don't like period pieces don't watch it. Since it's obviously a period piece.",10
Only read the books because of the show,"I am not going to start by saying how I don't understand all the low ratings, but rather by telling you why I enjoyed the show.I had never heard of the books nor read any of them before watching the show. So I was rather unbiased.
However I am a huge fan of period dramas and historical accuracy.
But Bridgeton to me, even though I love all those things usually was perfect.
It didn't try to get me on board with it being a historical piece but rather charmed with what it obviously had to offer: phenomenal chemistry between actors, great costumes, fantastical garden parties, amazing set design and great music.
To be honest I had to watch Bridgeton a second time to realize that all that classical music wasn't actually that classical but rather reimagined modern pieces ranging from Ariana Grande to Billie Eilish.To be frank: I loved it. I watched all 8 episodes in one sitting. And the diversity casting was a great choice. And not only because they actually touch on the whole POC in 1800 society in the show.
Bridgeton doesn't claim to be historically accurate but rather takes certain aspects of historical accuracy (women's standing in society, gossip papers in the 1800s usw) and runs with them.And because I am someone that needs to know how a story continues I read the first 5 Bridgeton Books right after finishing the show.
After reading I still love the show and think it was a great adaptation.I can only criticize one thing: the sibling banter needs to be ramped up by like 100. They have amazing dialogue in the books that is dearly missed in the show.
Other than that: great show. One of the better adaptation of a book series I have seen as of Right now.",9
Season 2 was absolutely terrible and painful to watch,Season 1 was soo good I looked forward to season 2! But the story line was soooo bad!!!! And the main character miss sharma was such a bad actress it was awkward and painful to watch!They hardly showed daphny and her husband wasn't in it and never spoken off!It was like watching a complete different series. The hair styles also were so bad in this season.,1
"An Objective & Unbiased, Unemotional, Un-bigoted Review","Okay Ladies and Gents! Bridgerton is not only binge worthy, but bears being watched at least 5 times! (I confess - I've watched it at least 7 times already!) There is so much depth to so many of the characters in Bridgerton, that each time, you will see something new that you did not notice before... From the multi-layered personality of Eloise who is ambitious enough to want to go to UNIVERSITY! - in a time when women were only allowed to study personal deportment, the history of British war heroes, the various lines of the monarchy, societal etiquette, home-maker skills of sewing & needlework, playing pianoforte and hierarchical deportment, as part of their education... To the two lead men; Anthony Bridgerton who is in love with someone (so, so, so below his station in life) that he is not allowed to marry; who is burdened by the responsibilities placed upon him by societal rules/laws as the eldest (29 yr old) male of the siblings in the Bridgerton family; and also is obviously still traumatised & grieving the loss/death of his beloved father since age 19... To 29 year old Simon Arthur Henry Fitzranulph Basset, the Duke of Hastings, who hates his late father for the emotional (and possibly physical) abuse and rejection/abandonment inflicted by the man upon him, due to his stammer/stutter and lack of perfection from birth. Simon is obviously at age 29, still longing for his mother who died in childbirth with him (beginning of Episode 2), and is so traumatized by this, that in making a vow to his father on the latter's death bed that he would never sire a child, it is obvious that he is at the same time, absolutely & terribly afraid that any wife of his could also die in childbirth as his own mother had done; and also afraid that any future child of his may be born afflicted with the same speech impediment as his. All of this is in addition to him wanting to end the Hastings line with himself. Let us not overlook how strong all of the Bridgerton young ladies are - even those wanting to get married are assertive, outspoken, ambitious and take-charge. Any modern man would find that admirable, and counter to his year 1813 male colleagues' attitudes (including Daphne's own eldest brother, Anthony) the Duke of Hastings is VERY impressed by Daphne's ability to defend herself against the ""Loathsome Toad, Lord Berbrook"", her assertiveness, and sense of humour, as well as him being considerate & respectful enough on their wedding night to reserve 2 rooms at the inn so as to ""allow [her, her] liberty"" as well as to ask ""Do you want me to stop?"" twice! No spousal rape here! I love the way Simon's psychological issues are slowly revealed by his Godmother Lady Danbury, his very perceptive boxing friend Will Mondrich, who told him ""you're angry, but not at me, so ... take it somewhere else and finally DO something about it"" as well as by Will's wife Alice - then gradually discovered by an inexperienced, but persistently perceptive & loving wife Daphne, episode by episode, with the culmination in her plain spoken, but passionate & loving speech and profession of unconditional love for him in the rain, at the end (episode 8) - all resulting in his surrender to that LOVE itself. As Lady Danbury told him - LOVE CONQUERS ALL!This was an extremely unique, modern and welcome update to romance in an otherwise stifling and archaic patriarchal time, when women were bartered like little more than the butchers meat, and men were not allowed to show nor verbally express the softer side of their vulnerability or emotions. Very well done indeed Chris Van Dusen, Shondaland and Netflix! Ignore the racist haters and keep up the excellent work of healing the divide.Masterful, nuanced acting on the part of Regé-Jean Page (as Simon) using subtleties of facial expression, body language and linguistic tones to convey the struggles of the brokeness and eventual healing (through unconditional love from his wife), of the character of Simon. The world today, needs more of this type of love, so we can have peace. Absolutely wonderful growth and new maturity in the acting of Phoebe Dynevor (as Daphne Bridgerton), compared to her previous parts/roles played. This role really allowed her to ""bring her 'A' game"", as well as showcase her wider range of acting ability than previous ones. It really highlights the importance of actresses choosing/accepting parts which would advance their careers for the long term, rather than just for a paycheck.",10
It's not perfect but it's perfect for me,"I love this show. I find it extremely entertaining and despite its flaws I can't help but give it a 10 because of season 2. I liked season 1 except for the terrible main romance. It had major problems. Lack of chemistry between the main leads and you had the female lead rape the male lead and they made it seem like she was in the right???? That was awful. Not to mention cringy sex montages that just made the male lead look like he had no stamina lol and because they had no chemistry everything seemed extra awkward. Not to mention Rege-Jean Page's lack of acting ability. The man can't act. I understand that he is attractive, but he needs some serious acting lessons. We had some emotional scenes and he looked like he wanted to burst into laughter. Atrocious actor. Luckily they learned their lesson in season 2 and the couple actually had chemistry and they didn't add anything like what happened in season 1. I can't wait to watch season 3 and hopefully we get more seasons of the rest of the couples that are left.",10
"Escapist fun, just like the books!","Fluffy, pretty, captivating! Well written and well acted! People who fuss about historical inaccuracies obviously either haven't read the books or haven't read history. Quinn takes as much liberty with history as Shonda takes with Quinn's source material. Both are fun and entertaining. If you want historical accuracy, read Hilary Mantel (also a great read/show, but much much more grim. As is history)",9
LOVE LOVE LOVE! It has a bit of EVERYTHING!!!,"Regal outfits. Scandalous gossip. Delightful love stories. Fierce sexual tension. Passionate sex scenes. Intense anticipation. Lighthearted comedy.The ONLY reason I didn't give it 10 stars is because Regé-Jean Page (Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings) isn't in season 2. Not even as a supporting or invited actor every once in a while 😭😭😭",9
"Beautiful , lovely , sexy and sweet","I cannot believe some of the reviews I read 😱
Especially the ones who says that it's not equally with the book. So what!!!!!
I just loved the whole show , the dresses , the houses , everything is over the top and I loved it all. I really hope the second part is coming very soon",10
Ridiculous,"It is a silly show with ridiculous plots and writing. The main characters look like a 30 some year old having sex with middle school Wendy from Peter Pan.
Dumb, boring, and not sexy.",1
Pretty Good,"I thought this was pretty good. Initially I kept passing it up as I searched for something to watch, someone told me to check it out, and I was glued for three days. I thought it was funny. Sure, you wouldn't see a lot of this back in those days, but have we forgotten to have an imagination. Use some noodle and expand your horizons a little. Now it helps when you have a GENEVIEVE DELACROIX. (OMG she is so sexy). Every time I look at her and hear her speak I melt in the couch. Please do not kill her off. I will stop watching.",8
Very bad storie of Antony and Kate,"I liked a series as a novel, something unreal and it took it to another level but I really didn't like the story of Antony and Kate at all. An unforgivable betrayal to her sister and they stay together, I didn't like it at all. And Penelope's story finally gets her noticed more and it turns out she gets hated for being the gossip paper writer. No, I didn't like it at all.",9
"Great start, should have stayed like that","I loved the first season so much. The second was just, fine, I expected a lot more after how the first one was.What I do like about the whole series: the era, even if it's not completely accurate, to me was very beautifully done. I love all the customes. I also love the fun detail of having modern songs turned into an era appropiate sound.The whole Lady Whistledown mistery in the first season was so fun to watch for me. I also loved the whole fake dating to real in the main characters the first season, I was rooting for it to happen.About the second season, I loved the new main ladies, so just for that my rating stays.",10
Must watch,A must watch series. At first i thought it would be not that great but its awesome .,10
Why all the bad ratings!!,I don't know why everyone rated this show so low. I love this show and cannot wait for the next seasons to come out. I cannot wait to see all the kids and how they fall in love! Even if it doesn't follow the books or isn't historically accurate it's still a pretty awesome show!,8
Julia Quinn must hate this...,"... I know I do. The novels sparkled and were a delight. So fun!To be fair, the TV series does have great costuming and sets, but that's pretty much it. In fact, the producers seem to make that their biggest focus, instead or character development. The casting is just wrong, the story isn't fun at all, and the gratuitous sex is just ... well, gratuitous.",1
Entertaining feel good drama!,"I never thought I would ger immersed in this series. I havent watched romantic movies or shows since sometime as they have just bored me mostly the lack of chemistry between the actors.However, this old fashioned romance actually got me interested, the drama, the costumes and the settings. In fact Season 2 was much more mushy and indulging than season 1. Loved the chemistry and love story of Anthony snd Kate. Anthony I woukd say was one of my favourite characters the whole season. Him with Kate was a very unlikely pairing, that made it all the more fun to watch. Also loved the on screen banter and rapport among the Bridgerton siblings. I was disappointed that there were only 2 seasons. Cant wait for season 3 to begin!",8
Indulgent like a cake,"This is one nice guilty pleasure. When it was released I was quite snobbish about it and didn't watch it, I am glad I changed my mind as I really enjoyed it. Let's skip the plot and just focus on what a pleasure is for the eye, the gardens, the tea parties, oh my the outfits, the saucy sex scenes (mostly season 1 though) and that wonderful ""ton"" spoken English. Don't expect anything to challenge your brain or any historical accuracy just go with it and enjoy, like you would enjoy a buttercream cake.",8
A nice break from my life,"I really don't understand all the horrible reviews. This show is for entertaining not history. I am a history buff and also huge Austen and Bronte fan so this isn't that, but it is entertaining. Beautiful dresses, scenery and people. I was stuck inside for a year working from home and this show was a perfect distraction from life for a while. A fantasy type of getaway. Don't read the reviews, try it and you might like or you might hate it. I loved it. So do all my friends and family.",9
AMAZING!!!,"Simply in love with seeing this adaptation of one of my favorite series!
Especially the fact of bringing black characters, this is incredible, we need to see ourselves at the top too! Do not get attached to the historical period, your racism will not pass!!",10
Heady Escapism,"Escapism at its finest. Gorgeous costumes, stunning sets, beautiful people. There's a ton of build up and heat and humor and passion, everything I want in the romance genre.It's a tv series based on a romance novel, not a historical documentary. It doesn't matter if it's not 100% historically accurate, that's not the point.The point is love, and Bridgerton delivers!",10
Couldn't give it a 1,"I can say last year's season had chemistry and a story, this year between Anthony and Kate.. ZERO. It doesn't matter what race you throw in, but if you're trying too hard to mix them and it shows... the chemistry is doomed. I mean the constant arguing and cold shoulder treatment until the last episode was annoying at best and then throw some passion in didn't seem intimate. I had to constantly fast forward because it wasn't real. Awkwardly a mess of a second season.",2
PERFECT!,I loved it so much! The characters are so amazing and talent! The story is very good and the appearance looks stunning. One of the most good series of the year and I can not wait for the next,10
Fabulous fun of old with a magical modern twist.,"With zero expectations, I stumbled upon Bridgeton to fill a gap in my holidays and was delighted. The chemistry between the two leads was exceptional and grew on me like a warm, yearning blanket. The actress playing Daphne is diverse in her ability to be strong, empathetic and vulnerable.
I enjoyed this so much and the extraordinary costumes and sets were beautiful. The modern take of music from Billy Eilish etc played in old ways was fun and the diversity of cast refreshing and magical to consider a world without an eye on race. This was a completly gorgeous, wonderfully entertaining piece.",9
Delightful fun,"I never read the books, but I am loving this series. The diversity is fantastic and refreshing.",10
Boring,Slow and boring. No reason to follow watching it. Very boring,8
Perfect,Missed some of the scenes from the books but overall 10/10 would and will watch over and over and over again,10
Wife wanted to watch this. Even she gave up (much to my happiness),"I don't normally want to watch things like this. I will admit to that up front. Wife has waded through enough of my SciFi preference I feel I owe it to her. Sometimes I can be happily surprised. This was not one of those times.My biggest complaint is it just wasn't good. I sat through a lot of Greys Anatomy and while much of it was cringe worthy some of the story arcs were interesting. I probably gave up on that show after no less than 5 years, maybe 6. I was shocked to learn it was still going strong a couple years ago but apparently people like it. Brdigerton is based on a novel(s?) that seem to be highly acclaimed, which initially led me to believe I might enjoy the show. I get the impression they seriously misfired on the original material.I have never been what anyone would consider a prude but I think a show better be able to stand on its story and the nudity should just be unnecessary window dressing. This show will be fine for those looking for window dressing. Everyone else need not apply.Meanwhile, we are really getting swamped in this 2020 wokedom. Novels have always been the best medium for creativity but woke is destroying period fiction/non-fiction unnecessarily. Series and films should be trying to create the settings as laid out by the author or go write your own material. It would be just as distracting if Kunta Kinte first ran into the slavers in the forest, it was Jack Nicholson out hunting a guinea. As fine an actor as Jack Nicholson obviously is, he would have ruined that film (rather the producers would have should they have made that casting decision).I am not going on to episode 2. Show gets a 3 because production quality and actors do well.",3
Loved it!,This is the first new shoes in years that I've been interested in. Who cares about the historical accuracy of the costumes or the casting? It's FICTION.,10
A new and interesting take on Regency drama,"I did not know the books, but I am a fan of the Jane Austin movies, so I was really waiting for this.
And I love it!
It took a bit to get used to the unusual form, but this series delivered everything I was hoping for: great costumes, actors you like / love, a story you could feel with. In fact I loved the series so much I bought the first book by Julia Quinn.
I did not like the book, so I will not read the other 7 books. But I do hope that Netflix will give us 7 more seasons of Bridgerton.
Thanks for so much fun!",10
Just...wow,"Season 1 was AMAZING (obvi) but season 2??? I rewound the ending 3 times after finishing the first time just because it was THAT good. When he finally said the ""L word,"" I died.... After completing season 2, I also immediately went to Amazon and purchased the ENTIRE 8 books. Please watch season 1 and 2 with an open mind. It's not a traditional period piece, but that's what makes the series so special. Enjoy!!",10
Fun and frolics,"So many bad reviews based on the brilliant diversity and lack of historical accuracy . It's so refreshing to see people of many ethnicities playing all parts and not just the below stairs characters . In my opinion good acting and chemistry between the main protagonists . I haven't read the book so can't comment but loved the fun of it especially the quartet playing billy eilish . Hang on !!!! she wasn't around in 1813 either , scandalous.",8
Embrace the fantasy and you'll have a grand time,"Folks, this is fantasy. Shonda Rhimes and company are presenting an alternative universe version of Britain's Regency period, in which (yay!) hotties of all races gleefully ripped each other's bodices. All the while dressed in absolutely fantastic clothes.Overall, this is escapist, guilty pleasure fun. Yet the series also finds time for some historical truths amid the fantasy, most of all the way young women were herded ignorant and unsuspecting into marriage back then, given no choices in life except to marry as well as possible and spend their lives as baby machines. Also the way a whiff of scandal, one innocent mistake could destroy an entire family's reputation.Come on, guys and gals, loosen your corsets and have some fun. Though for heaven's sake, don't watch this with your parents!",8
Garbage TV/Netflix,"There is nothing good in this show, acting is horrible, characters are dry and underdeveloped. Who is watching this? How low our IQ should be to accept this! 0 development on the story, 0 character development, stupid dialogue.",1
Awesome series( Nívia Gadelha),I Saw this series and despite being a little different from the book i liked Very mutch. the resemblance is incredible and perfect in some scenes. And the differences between the book and the series are necessary to make the plot more vivid.I do Love this series and became perfect.,10
There absolutely has to be a season 2!,"I had read the books a long time ago and when i saw the trailer for the first, i couldn't believe they were being adapted into a series. I was nervous at first, because adaptions rarely match the expectations of fans and this genre of books are well never really adapted.
Having now finished watching the series, i would say, i loved it! The series is very engaging and fun. The diverse cast was distracting at first and difficult to ignore. But by second episode it made sense and made the series even better! The casting for Daphne was perfect! I could see myself falling in love with her character, she acted so well.
The only thing that left me wanting was that I would have loved to see more of London of that time through their eyes.",10
"Wonderful, a visual delight!","Thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of the books. The sets, locations and costumes were visually stunning. The actors embodied the characters we have come to love, and I loved the diversity of the cast. It should be noted that there were many POC in the Regency period, and Queen Charlotte was actually a person of mixed ethnicity. There was also a black Duke who was a member of the European aristocracy. There were also many marriages of mixed ethnicity. It's a pity that history doesn't do more to highlight POC instead of surpressing these details, leading many uninformed of historical accuracy.",10
Historic for a modern generation,"I love the series. Is it an exact retelling of the books, of course not. Books are never translated perfectly to screen, but this takes a beloved series and gives it enough of a twist to watch it as an entirely new product. It's modern with its pop tunes turned into classical pieces and colorblind casting, but it also gives us a glimpse at the harsh reality women faced, in both high society and otherwise. The dialogue between characters shares some of that even more than the books did. Regency romances tend to glamorize the past, and the shows reminds us that while things are visually beautiful, the reality often was not.",10
Love love love,I loved this movie they truly did the book justice. I have loved Julia Quinn's books and this movie was wonderfully done. I can not wait for the second season which will hopefully be Anthony and Kate's story.,10
Just terrible.,"The script was so bad that I kept watching thinking it must be a satire. Clearly it was not. It was just bad writing , and often equally bad acting. At times I felt embarrassed for the cast. totally apart from the colorblind casting, some of the casting was just awful. Perhaps it was because the writing was so bad, some of the actors demonstrated no range at all - one expression, one emotion. I continued watching because a friend recommended it to me, but now I feel like a fool having wasted eight hours of my life!",1
Totally ridiculous but very enjoyable!,Just really enjoyed watching this even though it's not without its flaws. Really good cast and the Queen's wigs alone deserve a BAFTA 🙌🏻,8
Avid reader,Having read all of the Bridgerton books I can say this series is wonderful. The characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors and have brought something more to each. I cannot wait to see what they do with the rest of Julia Quinns characters! For those who have issue with casting just stop. As readers we have the ability to imagine characters any way we wish and to see such a diverse group of actors bring these characters to life is impressive. I am going to reread the series with the bonus of having more depth to each character as a result of this first season. Well done to all!!,10
It's all about the Spoon,"I admit I've come late to the Bridgerton party, but it's worth a look just to swoon at Rege-Jean Page and his chemistry with a spoon. Why some viewers are angry about this reimagining of ""history"" is beyond me. It's no Downton Abbey, but it's not trying to be. It is more a modernized blend of Pride and Prejudice and Hamilton, sans the hip hop. You have luscious costumes and contemporary music made classical interwoven throughout the series. You know the Duke and Daphne are made for each other, but it's interesting to see how they eventually get there. What's refreshing is that race is no real construct in how the upper crust in society relate to one other. There's a few mentions on how Bridgerton became a blended society, but otherwise it's not a factor of influence. And why should it be? Simply put, except for some in society who view the Duke as a rake, he is not treated or perceived as less than anyone because of his race. Rather, he's higher in society due to his rank, so women and their mothers clamor for his favor. This colorblindness may be why some find the series provocative. Or uncomfortable. A black man playing THE romantic lead is not what viewers are used to seeing. But it's worth a look, for this reason alone. And to watch the Duke's love for Daphne, and a very blessed spoon.",8
Great show please make more,I'm obsesses with this i feel in love with the chemistry between Daphne and Simon,10
"Bright, brilliant, romantic, fun.","Bridgerton, Ohh wow. Before I go on I feel the need to explain that I'm a typical man, I like action and comedy, keeping fit and drinking beer, I don't really do 'chick flicks' or romance but Bridgerton - upon watching it at my wife's request - grabbed 100% of my attention.
It's set brilliantly in an almost tongue in cheek take on the Regency period, some other reviews have pointed out the mixed races of various families that would be unrealistic in that era in London but for me all the parts were acted well and so I can't say I noticed, the charecters are believable and that's all I took from them. The balance of romance and 'duty / conflict' in this show are perfect, whilst some tituations had me laughing others had me yelling ""Just kiss her!"" at the screen - and I'm not easy to excite! Every episode leaves you wanting more, it's simply beautiful, it's fun, just when you think Netflix have exhausted every genre up pops something entirely new.
I'm not sure how anyone can be leaving poor reviews for this show, it's funny, romantic, dark at times, a completely refreshing piece that's completely different to anything else around at the moment. All the loose ends seemed to be tied up at the end of the season but if S2 does get made I'll be waiting eagerly.",10
Season 2 SUCKED,"Season 1 was 10/10, but season 2 was terrible, the acting sucked, there was no comedy, the romance was boring. The story line was predictable in the worst way. Very disappointing.",5
Relaxing,"I am a romantic soul, and anything that moves butterflies im my gut - is worth watching. It is light, refreshing and entertaining. Obvious chemistry between the main characters. Historical logic was not needed. The message is - love. If you wish to escape reality, relax your brain from heavier movies, and just chill, i dont see why wouldnt you enjoy it.",8
"If you liked the books, you'll like the series.","First - this in NOT a portrayal of history. This is set in the regency era and is based on a series of books by Julia Quinn that follows the relationships of the Bridgerton family.If you are expecting an accurate portrayal then keep looking. If you enjoy regency romance and can accept the fact that the director/producers/screen-writers took liberties to make it appealing to a wider range of audience, I think you will enjoy it. If you're a fan of regency romance then I urge you to check out the book series.",8
Gorgeous show!,"This show was everything we've been missing on tv lately! Yes it has a diverse cast...get over it, I was amazed how beautiful the cast was and it being diverse only made the show better in my eyes. I haven't read the books so I can't talk about how true to the story it is, but I loved this story. I binged it in one day, I couldn't stop watching. I loved all the little nuances, the backdrop, the actors were amazing. I say you go watch this show and enjoy how the world should have looked from the very beginning",10
Sucker for Romance!,Absolutely loved it! Love the diversity! I can't wait to see more of it.,10
Perfect,"I absolutely loved! The new characters fit perfectly into the plot, and the iconic scenes from the book are all present.",10
triggering,"It started out as a 7-ish out of 10, quirky and whatnot, reminded me of pride and prejudice. But after around 4 episodes, Daphne became unbearably more annoying, way more than she already has. The leading pair had no chemistry to start with, and later in the show it became just sex and then fights about having a child. It was incredibly dragged out and agonizing to watch, and interesting characters like Eloise or Benedict have close to no screentime. I really wanted to like Penelope aswell, and I feel so sorry that the writers made her character the dullest and most clichee ""ugly friend"" with unavailable love interest etc. and most of the time I just pitied her. All in all the writers have failed to create any likeable characters at all, and the two and a half likeable ones had too little screen time for the viewer to get attached to them. The mere conversation between the leads are infuriating, they're both talking as other were a wall. Also idk about you guys but I was expecting prettier costumes than the ones shown, atleast the dresses, their form irritated me. Oh and two stars are for Eloise and Benedict and nothing more.",2
"Wonderful, funny and interesting","I finished the show in one day. I saw it with my sister, we both liked the idea of the 1800s, I mean, who wouldn't want to live in those years? The Duke is simply so mysterious, which makes the show even better, because the more minutes you see from the show, the more you learn about him and his past. You have to see this show, it's one of my favorites and I'm sure you'll like it too!!!!!",10
Netflix killed it with this one.,"Absolutely loved Bridgerton. The story telling was awesome. They way these character's stories were told was amazing. The narration of the show *chefs kiss*, and the acting was spectacular. Many of the actors/actresses on the show were new to me (sorry. I tend to live under a rock), but their performances were awesome. Also the chemistry between the two leads. Whew!! AMAZING!! All I have to say is that I rarely watch romance shows, but I loved this one. Netflix knew what they were doing the moment they got Shondaland to sign with them.**UPDATE**Season 2 bumped my score up to a 10/10. Kate Sharma & Anthony Bridgerton are perfection!!! I am obsessed and I cannot lie, their story is better than Daphne and Simon's! Sorry not sorry!",10
Pleasantly Surprised!,"I'll be honest. This show is not the kind of show I normally watch. I normally have a simple list of criteria to help me decide what to watch. I usually only watch shows or movies if it has two or more of the following: spaceships, aliens, time travel, cool weapons, advanced technology, swords and other ancient weapons, good action, martial arts, hot actresses, superpowers, story set during ancient or medieval times.So while this wasn't really the usual kind of genre that I would watch--the trailers I saw did show some action (duels, boxing, etc.) and hot actresses (Phoebe Dynevor is like a younger hotter Deborah Ann Wohl)...I gave it a chance.And I was slowly drawn in by the very interesting story (and twists and surprises) about high society life in 18th Century London. It's very interesting to learn about life in the ""ton"" for girls who've come of age and the boys who've come to inherit their father's titles and the challenges associated with these.The costumes and sets look very authentic, the cast is very talented. The story WILL PULL YOU IN.I can't wait for season 2 now! Though I'm kind of glad they revealed the identity of Lady Whistledown at the end instead of leaving us hanging for a year until next season.",8
A masterpiece..,Its been 4 years since i saw something that i would wanna write a review about it. Season 2 its so worth it. In the beginning k didn t wanna give it a change cause the msin characters of season 1 where left off..But after the first episode when they meet on the horses ..i saw it all in a day(i have 2 children..so i prefered it than my sleep) The acting of the couple is amazing anx i would like to see them win an award next year..It was truly eoth my time.,10
The one -star reviews are ridiculous!,"I actually think this series is a solid 8, but I gave it 10 stars to help balance out the baffling 1-star user reviews. There is nothing whatever wrong with the series! It's beautifully done in every way-gorgeous costumes, lavish sets, clever writing, good acting, and compelling characters. Who on earth gives something like this a 1-star review? Is there some kind of vendetta going on here that I don't know about? This is fiction people! It's a charming, creative romance very loosely based on some historical facts, is there something wrong with that? Watch a documentary if you want historical accuracy. This is entertainment, and very enjoyable entertainment at that! I'm enjoying it immensely and look forward to each episode. I was delighted when a second season was just announced. I hope there may be many more to follow!",10
Dull,"Bad acting combined with no real storytelling. This could have had so mich potential, but it seems like it's been written by a 12yo.",1
Absolutely loving it!,"I believe, not all shows require to be complicated or following a mysterious story line.
I have read many people were talking about its contradictions with the history at that time! But it is a romance!! It's not a documentary!
I absolutely loved and enjoyed watching this show!! Shonda always makes the audience really engaged as like grey's anatomy! Will highly recommend this show if you are after a chilled, smooth, beautiful and gossipy drama.
Really liked the choice of the actors!!",10
Love it,"Love the show. Can't wait for 2nd series
Great choice in cast",9
Delightful departure from reality!,"Imagine what the world would be like now if ""the Experiment"" had taken place some two centuries ago.Why is it that all the haters want the show to be something it is not? Take it for what it is...guilty pleasure. The departure from reality is fantastical just as Dr Who and certainly has the potential for an equally dedicated cult following. I hope the show will go on for as many decades and portray many generations to come.The gossip and scandal are done with intrigue and finesse and the over-the-top costumes are pure delight. Having seen Charlotte and rewatched the first two seasons, I cannot wait for more!",10
Two seasons review...,"Season one for me was quite captivating. The wardrobes, sets, acting, pace and story line all fabulous! I could hardly wait for this second season....and it was without a doubt, meh. I was underwhelmed. I kept watching with the hopes that it would improve but it didn't.The pace of the main characters story was ""off"" to me. Also, there where noticeable holes....but tge biggest one? Where the heck was Simon! He should have been there to support his friend when he opened his ""Gentlemens club"" and definitely shouldn't have missed his brother in laws ""wedding "" which was given by the Queen no less.Overall, I am a fan. But a disappointed one.I PRAY that a season three will follow and put it all right again.",8
Easy and enjoyable to watch,"Can't wait for the next series. Easy to watch, and I couldn't stop watching .",10
"The Forced ""Diversity"" is Weird and Distracting","It's the early 1800s in England and like 10% of the upper class in the show are Black. It is so absurd that it is distracting and makes it hard to watch. I put ""diversity"" in quotes as it isn't actual diversity, just adding Black people. If we're going to make some weird past that never existed might as well throw in some Asians, or Latin Americans, maybe a Native American. Imagine how weird it would be to make a movie about African tribes from 200 years ago, and 10% of the Chieftains and warriors are pasty British guys. I don't mind changing races for sci-fi or fantasy, etc, but real historic time periods? So silly.",1
Entertaining,"I'd say this series is one part love story from a woman's perspective, one part contemporary, and one part idealist future world where race is (almost) a non-issue.",8
Perfect!,Eu amei demais. A fotografia. Os atores e o roteiro. Nao ficou cansativo e maratonei mesmo tudo em um dia!!!!! VEM SEGUNDA TEMPORADA LOGO CARAIIII!,10
Love this series,I dont get why there are so many bad reviews. I loved this series and all og the characters in it. I hope we will get a season 2.,10
Enjoyable Jane Austen style period romp,Held your attention which is impressive given that not a lot happens. Some of the characters could have been developed more but no doubt there will be further series. Thought the overall storyline around the oath a little weak.,8
This show is absolutely amazing and worth a watch!,"I haven't read the book, so I watched the show with no expectations at all and I loved it! I absolutely cannot wait for season 2.",10
Never mind the weird racial mix up...,"Ok to make up a black queen, even though it is ridiculous for that time, but why the heck is it so difficult to follow the story line of the books? They are well written and quite entertaining without needing to enhance with silly side plots or change the main story line... Or don't call it Bridgerton?",4
Wow,Wonderful and really keeps you on your toes. for real a very good watch to curl up on the couch.,9
Not familiar with source materials but I love this show.,"It's been a long time since I watched a good romantic drama and I'm quite surprised to see low ratings for this show. I'm not familiar with source materials so I'm not going to compare each. The most admirable thing about this show is the way they mix modern music with classical music. The plot is a normal period romance story but the execution of the story is great. In the beginning, I was worried the pace is gone to be slow but guess what the pace is perfect. I'm sure you are gone enjoy this show so much as I do. The first half of the season mainly focused on our main two characters but in the second half of the season, there are few subplots that are good to see. I'm getting bored with romance drama when they focused on just the main couple. This is my first time seen these two performances and they did a great job, I really enjoyed their acting. They have great chemistry on screen. Also, the supporting cast is good especially the queen. The only negativity I see is the predictability of the show. Writers should have done better with the mystery of Lady Whistledown, I notice half of the season who is Lady Whistledown. I am looking forward to the second season and I recommend this especially if you are a fan of romantic period drama.",8
Beautiful,This is the best!!!! You must watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10
The series is just perfect,"The series is just perfect. A gift for book fans, as the adaptation captured the essence of the story and all the important references are there. I'm looking forward to the second season.",10
Beautiful and funny!!,"Love this adaptaption of the first book. Is it true to the book 100%? No, but it keeps the original vibe of fun and sassy and keeps a viewer entertained. Watched the whole season in one sitting!",10
cultural appropriation at its worst,Sad. Another telling of a story about how bad rich 19th century British people were.,1
Smash it in one go ☺,I really enjoyed it and think it was a great watch. Defoe one for the girls who love a good chick flick kinda series. Everyone has there own taste in films/series so my advise is to give it a go and see what you think.......... bad reviews have never put me off and nor will they :),9
Loved it,"I have not read the book and knew nothing about it and I was not sure I would even like the series since I'm not really into romantic series/movies but I gave it a chance after seeing the trailer and from episode one I couldn't stop watching. I loved everything about it, the characters, the music, the clothing, the story. It made me both smile and cry at times. Eloise is my absolute favourite character. I can't wait for season 2.
I don't get the criticism about it not being historically accurate, for me it was just a story, in an alternative universe if you want. I once read a book with similar era describes but it was set in the future on another planet with aliens. Stories are stories. I'm not sure I would even like it if it was historically accurate. Watch it for what it is, a made up story. If you like romantic drama you will probably enjoy it.",8
"Funny, amazing, the perfect fake dating trope","Is a great story, really well made and enjoyable to watch, I think the actors all did a great job and is really refreshing to see people of color in period stories.
And if you are mad about that last thing then stay mad and quiet thanks.",10
Changes happen,"Just like any adaptation, changes happen and when it comes to bridgertons they were very welcome, black people, feminist speeches and real problems.
Even people who didn't know the books are getting attached to the characters, we can only ask for a second season.",10
Season two much better than first,"I wasn't really interested in watching second season. The first was fun but got pretty silly as it went along to where I lost interest by the end. Seems they ran out of things to write and just plugged sex scenes in everywhere at the end and I was tired of Simon and daphne. I did however love Penelope and Eloise, so gave the second season a go when I had nothing else to watch. Then couldn't stop! The second season in my opinion was far better. Less ridiculous and turns out main characters of Kate and Anthony are so much better. Such good chemistry and acting, plus felt they expanded Eloise's character more.",8
What the...?,"For the love of all that is holy, this was absolute garbage. A dumpster fire of the first order. The diction was pure drivel. The plot was flimsy at best. Predictable doesn't begin to describe how formulaic this series was. The garishness of the period dress was laughable. The ""romantic"" scenes were something that could have come from a 1980's high school movie like ""Porky's"". And, please... don't EVEN get me started about the actress who played the Queen. She had more wigs than Rip Taylor (who would have been a better Queen than the actress they had). And this Lady Danbury - she looked like she raided Prince's closet and was ready to go clubbing. The only (and The Rock means ONLY) bright spot was Jonathan Bailey, who could maybe pass for a young Hugh Jackman. Otherwise... It was bad. Poor. Waste of time. Do yourself a favor and AVOID this at all costs.",1
I think I love you so what am I so afraid of,Two friends become the it couple pretending to be in love but will low self esteem and niavete and fear tear them apart.Who is lady whistle down and will the queen and eloise be able to unmask him or her. Stay tuned to find out.,8
I Love the adaptation!,I Love the adaptation! Let the second season come!,10
Loved it!!,I was shocked to see the bad reviews on here! I adored every moment of this series and I am greatly looking forward to season 2. Yes it is very loosely based on a well loved book series which I have read dozens of times... do I care? No! It was great fun and had all the feels! Fabulous.. bring on season 2!,10
A vibrant show - - nothing like a BBC piece,"This is not your mother's period drama piece.
This is so much more.Yes, the costumes are not historically accurate. Did that take away from the show? Maybe for you, but in the vein of Coppola's Marie Antoinette, it very much displayed the lavishness and possibility that period clothing could be more. The costume design team has made a masterpiece, it was a genuine pleasure to see such intricate and breathtaking pieces shown. From the Queen's court dress to Daphne's blue morning dress - they are beautiful, simply put.Yes, there are black aristocrats (aside from the main hero, portrayed by Regé-Jean Page) which is not entirely historically accurate. Does this change the character? His motivations? No, he's still Simon. Does the fact that there are black aristocrats get addressed? Yes, in a very moving speech from the (mind-blowingly perfect portrayal) of Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh).Yes, it's not family-friendly, in the traditional sense of the ratings system. Does this take away from the perfectly executed family scenes between the Bridgerton siblings? No, it does not. To quote Lady Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) ""We like each other"", and that is something that is integral from the books and is now in the show.As someone who has watched many period pieces and suffered through the uncomfortable Mansfield Park (1999), these actors and actresses are worlds apart. It's fresh and dramatic and exactly what I would expect from the combined talents of Julia Quinn, Shanda Rimes, and Chris Van Dusen.While I'm just another fan, and one who has watched Pride and Prejudice (2005) one too many times, I can confidently say that this is my favorite period drama. Is it because it's newly released? Dramatic? A visual joy? No, because many other period pieces I could say the same for.It's because in every aspect of the show they have modernized the story, but in subtle ways that do not over-power the larger scope of the show. The excellent cinematography and set design, diversity in casting, scripting in a way that isn't right out of Austen, and the score. I could wax poetic and write another 400 words on the score and audio alone. Kris Bowers: you are so very talented and as my best friend as my witness, I had to pause and go on a ten minute excited rant about the track (that I now know and have downloaded) ""Simon and Lady Danbury"".At the end of the day, don't take my word for it. Form your own opinion. If it's not your cup of tea, then go get a juice box.",10
Bridgerton is an Excellent series from Netflix,"I love British movies and tv services from Pride and prejudice, anything from 1800 time period. This TV seriesfrom Netflix addes a twist. It was captivating. I read the book. Usually the book is always better. But this series was better than the book. It makes you want to see again and again. Can't wait to see the next series",10
Too much 21st century in the Georgian Age,"I like the story line and the acting. The problem is, it is very hard to watch an historical drama, if I can call this one, when someone is imposing their desire for diversity and inclusion on a series like this. In no way would the population at the time, especially in higher society, have been this racially mixed. So, one ends up feeling as if the producers/director tried way too hard and it comes across like a cheap shot. It also feels forced. Badly done!",2
Wonderful,I haven't seen such a good show in a long time. It only took me a day to finish it. All I can say is that I can't wait for season 2.,10
The best show in 2020,"The best show in 2020!
The actors are so good in ther jobs that I feel I was living with them!",10
Série Ótima.,"Muito bem ADAPTADA, roteiro incrível, fotografia impecável e o elenco é MARAVILHOSO. Um elenco diverso e representativo o que atualmente é essencial nas produções.",10
Give it a try,"If you are in the mood for something mindless and light during these trying times - give this escape a try. Don't overthink it. I really don't understand the ""1"" ratings at all - wondering about the validity of those repeated reviews. It's not Pride and Prejudice but entertaining and visually well done. I thought the casting and acting was very good, and appreciated the modern twists.",10
Head over heels!,"This is series is so much fun! I absolutely adored it. I shared my enthusiasm about this series with my friends, and we've all raved about The Bridgertons. We can't wait to see which couple the writers will focus on next and tell their stories of scandals and romance. Praying for a second, third and fourth season to come!",10
WARNING: Rhimes with Kitsch,"Don't you hate it when they bring one of your beloved books to the screen and throw out all your favorite private moments?Because they think TV audiences want flash and trash.Bridgerton gets the TV treatment so hard it's unrecognizable. Glitzy gowns and coronets? Oh, plenty...fabulous interiors and servants? Galore...but charm? No. It's like a ride in a romcom theme-park.Take, for example, the pall mall (croquet) game in Episode 3. Instead of granting viewers - along with the other characters - the time to discover how each person reveals character in play, the writers spoil it by telling us everything ahead of time: he's this, she's that, etc. All that's left to do as the game proceeds is to check mental boxes : yes, yes, yes. So dull.Pen's story is boring and Eloise's is artificial. The story of the Club is totally empty of drama. As for Anthony and Kate, even when they get down and dirty, they're animatronicMoreover, what isn't sentimentalized and crude is brazenly lifted from past series - like Anthony's dunking, which reproduces Colin Firth's dip in P&P.So do yourself a favor: watch Episode 1, then fast-forward.P. S. 'Cowper' is pronounced 'Cooper.' But, hey, what do Americans know?P. P. S. Alternatively, add some spice - since Jonathan Bailey (Anthony) is gay - by turning Kate into Kit.",4
Love,"The series is amazing, a litle difference to the books, but in this format it was incririble.",10
Just enjoy it,"Lots of people are being negative re this show.
I won't be for the most part. My main critique was the music. I didn't like it. I don't think it fitted into the timeline. I was also not enamoured by the gratuitous sex scenes. I personally don't think they were necessary.
I really, really enjoyed this fictional story though. And that is what it is, a fictional story set in a specific period of history. It is not a historic retelling though. I could care less that there were black actors playing non stereotypical caricatures. The story was enjoyable. The acting good. I was left wanting more after each episode.
The set designs were the stand out for me though. It was a visual treat looking at the flowers and lights that were everywhere especially during the parties.
If you are looking for something to binge on then this can be enjoyed over a weekend. Enjoy it for what it is and not for what you think it should be. It is harmless fun.",8
Excellent Show,"I don't write reviews, but after reading the negative reviews I felt I needed to tell everyone the truth! I have never read the books, and I like history but I don't know all of history, but I loooooove TV and a good romance. This show is one of the very few shows where I literally cannot stop looking at it and cannot turn it off. The chemistry between the main characters on this show was absolutely phenomenal. I feel like anyone who enjoyed Downton Abbey would love this show. It has a similar feel.",10
A beautiful story with innocence,Its a beautiful storyline based on the British lifestyle with a little bit spice and a great love story with innocence.... trust me it give you some fresh air after a decade of nothing good.,10
History and Fantsy Meet,A must watch. History and fiction meet for pure entertainment. I loved the idea of the 1800s coming to life with many people who were different. Looking forward to session 2.,10
"Pretty awful, actually","Could only watch the first 10 minutes. The acting is terrible...and if a story can't grab you in the first 10 minutes, it won't ever.",3
Perfect series,"I was enchanted in the first episode, I'm completely in love. I can't wait for the second season",10
Loved it!!,The actors & actress for this series is the best. I love every episode & cant wait for season 2. Wow what a great job!! Please have a series 2!! This should win alot of awards for sure!!💖💖💖,10
Can' Wait For Another Season,Outstanding! I see many possibilities for the story lines. I can't wait for the next season. Love the story and actors and actresses.,10
Great,"This is great ,although I haven't read the books .",10
Very Entertaining!,I enjoyed this series very much. I almost did not watch until I got to the end of episode one. I enjoy all the characters and And the string quartet playing contemporary music.,10
Very overrated!,Everyone is talking up this show but it's very overrated. Not like gossip girl at all.,1
I loved every minute of it,These reviews are ridiculously rude and idiotic. It's a Romance show that is supposed to keep you wanting more and more because their love is so tangible and when their not together you can't stand it. The show does exactly what it's supposed to do. And Instead of being happy that the whole cast isn't White as usual now everyone is complaining about Historical Inaccuracies and that it's ridiculous. Some people will literally Never be Happy. I loved this show so much because I am a true romantic..I usually get bored with period pieces but not this one. I loved Daphne and Simon. I loved all the characters. It's amazing. I'm sad it's over and I can't wait for another Season.,10
Loved this,"My husband and I enjoyed it. It was cute, funny and easy to watch. I think other people just took it to seriously to enjoy it. Either they hate love or never loved at all.",10
A lovely masterpiece!,"Bridgerton is full of surprises! with a lot of romance, comic relief, powerful speeches and striking scenes, we have a series with a plot and captivating actors! it certainly differs from books, but nothing that a good fan cannot love! it is incredible to be able to see the whole ""history"" of the most fertile family in society coming to life!",10
Beautiful,"Is the best, is so beautiful!!!!! You must see it immediately. You won't regret it!!!!!!!",10
Excellent period romantic drama.,"Superb acting, costumes and sets. Some might say a bit too girly but as a guns and blast them up male viewer, this series is enjoyed by both my wife and myself.",10
Mindless drivel and brutal acting,Like watching a high school play. No historical accuracy horrific acting. What a waste of time,1
Worth watching,This show brought me to life it is so good the characters are so likeable and the diverse cast is amazing Truly an amazing show hoping for a season two,10
Loved every minute!,"I am a big fan of the book series, and I was not disappointed At All. My husband and I binges the whole season in one night, and Ibhave no regrets! 😄
Some things have been changed, but that's only natural in a different format. I think Shonda Rimes did a FANTASTIC job with this season, and I really look forward to more!",10
Creative Period Piece,"Such a creative concept of a period piece/family drama mixed with historically inaccurate features such as the representation of all ethnicities in the upper-class and beautiful renditions of modern songs. Even though the end of the seasons is (at least thus far) pretty predictable, each episode managed to capture my interest. A series for the culture, which definetely has contributed to a certain ""revival"" of the fashion of that time.",9
Love it,"I just love it. For me, this is one of the best tv series I have ever watched! I highly recommend to watch and enjoy with it. Second season is my favourite, but the first is also awesome!",10
Really enjoyed this,"I have not read the book(s),but watched this on Netflix. I was swept away. Is it a true period piece? No. I found it refreshing to see the diversity in the cast. Only in episode 5 or 6 do we come to understand the social/cultural mix for the piece. The characters are lively. The banter is funny when needed and serious when necessary. This is a love story, and an epic one. The tortuous seduction between the main characters is a beautiful thing to watch. How Simon treats Daphne when they finally consummate their union is the stuff of fairy tales., Every young girl dreams of this kind of ""first time""; he, the experienced lover, and she the eager, trusting bride. So, is it a fantasy? Yes, and a good one.",10
Trash TV with a Victorian era Twist,"If you have nothing to watch and are looking for some casual teenage heartthrob trash TV this is it. The only surprise is, it's not set in a high-school but rather in the victorian era. The story had me cringing at every step with almost too frequent sex scenes. There is no villan or remotely likeable character, just a bunch of annoying people making absurd and nonsensical decisions and having sex while doing it.",1
Loved it,"The Bridgerton isn't the same without the Duke of Hastings, but I have to say that for some reason I liked the second season more than the first one.. I saw Anthony with a different point of view compared to the first season. Everyone deserves true love.",9
Something different,The characters are so cool and the actors play very well. Even convinced me that I wanted to live in the 1800s.,10
Must watch!!,"Absolutely stunning production with incredibly talent (and easy in the eye) cast!
So binge-worthy...Easy to watch, engaging and just beautiful tv!Don't get bogged down with all the miserable people giving this great series low ratings...they obviously take themselves way too seriously and don't know how to relax and have a little fun.This is not a historically accurate show, it's not trying to be. If you want facts and no fun maybe read a book and take your arrogance somewhere else.",10
Eye Candy,"I'm giving this a higher rating than I should, not because of the storylines (predictable) but because of the lead actor. I'm a 56 year old white woman and all I can say is yum-ee!",8
Captivating series!,Couldn't stop watching! Hopeful for another season of this great cast and intriguing story line!! Definitely racy so caution to those with tender sensibilities...,10
Be Authentic in Casting,"I have nothing against black actors and actresses, but using them in period dramas like this when there were none present in aristocratic families or the nobility of the era is as logical as having one of them whip out a cell phone. This spoils the show for me.",5
Quite tremendous - approach with an open mind,"I've read a lot of these reviews and the criticism they contain, but wonder how many people ventured past the first episode, which was somewhat overwhelmed by all the superficial flash employed as an early attention-grabber. The first half of episode 1 seems a confused jumble of excess rather than an introduction to character and story, making me question if it would settle and actually not be crap, but gradually it began to extricate itself, tone things down and draw the viewer in.By episode 2, the only truly irritating thing for me was the voiceover of Julie Andrews as Lady Thistledown, a silly attempt at aping Dame Edith Evans as Lady Bracknell. Every other anomaly - the ethnicity of some elements of the ruling classes, the unlikely modern fabrics and patterns, the orchestral arrangements of current popular music, the Duke dressed as though he is about to take to the stage at the Swan Theatre to play Romeo - all these things exist alongside what we expect from a traditional period piece without replacing them, and it only needs a small shift of perception, one click of the kaleidoscope and everything falls into place.This isn't period drama based on strict rules of time and place, but set in a time and place that has been reimagined, occupied by people who are different but the same - backward-looking, forward-looking, trapped by convention, ignoring convention, struggling with moral dilemma and hoping for rescue, all within the shifting landscape of a society where everyone competes to belong but no-one is truly safe.This is not period drama infected with modern woke ideas either, as some have accused. Just about every societal repression you can think of is there, just as it would normally be in a traditional telling. Interestingly, the cast (some of whom seem to belong in other eras conveyed by their behaviour and dress) all seamlessly occupy the same story, their triumphs and disasters are those of any time, their concerns and problems those of any century.The story takes the usual romantic twists and turns, plus a few unconventional ones which are explored and resolved inventively. The performances are good, although one or two of the minor characters could have been better. The leads are an engaging pair and their dilemma preposterous but entertaining and absorbing. This series was well-plotted and gained more assurance with every episode, which is why I think it a shame so many gave up too early, wrote 1 star reviews and dismissed it for historical inaccuracies.Lighten up. It's not a history lesson, and whatever colour people are, whatever clothes they are wearing, the fact the Queen is seen in the bath when that would have been equally unlikely - it's a tale told with style that follows the usual path of English period drama while giving it a mischievous tweak at the same time. The result is a glorious mix that is well worth watching.I'd give it 10 stars but for the annoying Julie Andrews, so it's a 9 from me.",9
Incredible FICTIONAL TV Show,"The trolls are throwing a fit because the fabulous Shonda Rhimes made Bridgerton with a diverse cast. This is an impeccable show. The casting, the writing, the directing, the costumes, the sets, the lighting. Everything about it is just wonderful. Shonda hit this one out of the park! It's a fictional story. Yes, it's a period piece. But so is Hamilton, starring a Puerto Rican A.Ham and a black A.Burr. I would not change a thing about the Tony winning cast of Hamilton. I wouldn't change a thing about Bridgerton. It's a delight to watch. You will laugh. You will cry. Your senses will just soak up the beauty of the show. I hope we see more diverse casting in the future. This show is not supposed to be historically accurate. So, get over yourself and just enjoy a delightful, well executed show.",10
Breathtaking,"Does who dislike are just not right for this gerne i guess which fine but if you love some romance in any way possible this is the one. I've binged it, it was fabulous. I'm hungry for more while being sad it's done",10
I absolutely loved the show,"I love the endless lovestory, I know, Im hopeless.. I love the beautiful surroundings where the film is shot and not least the beautiful acting!
But the best thing is definitely their language, it's wonderful to listen to! If only we spoke like that today!",10
✨Brilliant ✨,"Beautiful sets, gorgeous costumes and each actor was brilliant. My favourite was Lady Danbury whose regal imperious nature stole every scene. I can see why this is the #1 show on Netflix and it inspired me to read Julia Quinn's books.",10
Awful attempt.,"Period piece where fantasy paints a picture of equality, sexual desire and romance for our modern day pop culture. Original score of artists like Maroon 5, Ariana Grande and et al covered by a Classical Quartet to help fit the modern narrative. Shows like this are just pure rubbish, shallow and brain washing.If you want to make a modern day Teen drama then do so but there is no reason to take it back to the year 1800 and use historical figures as a gateway to a false narrative. It just an awful idea.The costumes were awesome hence 1 star.",1
Immensely great epic drama,"This drama, based on a famous series of books, is often hailed as not just one of the more popular and talked about shows of recent years - but also very acclaimed as one of the best. And for good reason.Without having read the novels as of yet, this show indeed conveys its period drama splendidly, whilst also adding some artistic and unique, interesting liberties along the way. The actors all do an incredible job, very career defining, and some you very much hope to see more of, conveying a vast range of emotions and humour. Sharply written and paced indeed.The cinematography, cutting and editing is great, and the series features some overall stellar imagery and costumes works. Very beautifully put together.Definitely a highly recommended show!",9
Wonderful Yearning Romance,This show is surrounded by a yearning romance and scandal that leaves the viewer wanting more. You find yourself yearning for the couple and you feel the tension as if it's your own and that takes a great writer and director. Having so many stories building in one show sets up what ever comes next. I love all the seasons so far but i want more of this couple I can't get enough. The chemistry that the actors and actresses had was beautiful and the story was so well written. The director really did an amazing job capturing each not only the intense sexual tension but also the heart break and troubles that each story carried. You can empathize and sympathize with each character in some way. This series is amazing!,10
people do realise that this is not a historica bio right?,Ignore the negative reviews! this is wonderful... I don't even want to mention diversity but the fact that it pissed so many people off means our world is still a mess. Sit back and enjoy the sexy drama!,9
People don't know what they are talking about,"Hands down great show, personally in a group of 10,000 women who all have suggested it. Don't take these few 1 stars for anything more than pettiness.",10
Simply nice and amazing,"1) the cast is amazing, every character is strongly played and has its proper place in the story
2) the plot is good (no, didn't read the books), although the identity of Ms W became obvious around 3d part
3) yes, we finally got Pride and Prejudice with sex. Still, a sex quite politely shown. Like, a sex a normal lucky couple would have. The leading couple looks amazing together.
4) atmosphere is amazingThis is a review from someone coming from a country which never went to other countries and brought slaves from there, so neither do we have any history of rasism or segregation, nor do we have any issues with using the word ""black"", nor fancy multiracial casting in historical dramas. All people I know simply find it awkward, as most people in this world will find awkward a black father having a white son in a Hamlet production, or white people playing Korean scholars in a historical dorama, or non-white people in the British high society in 1813... It is also quite annoying to see everywhere all these hateful and victimized comments about white (modern) people being obliged to be ashamed all the time of something they never did (especially the white heterosectual man, obviously), and even being obliged to change their history on screen.
Still, if this is the way for american society to deal with its trauma, they have the right to do it anyway they please.
With me being annoyed at blind casting in historical movies (yes, everyone is really, really tired of american social traumas and pursue of some perfect tolerance working for everyone), and avoiding this series for quite a long time, I watched it, and I totally forgot about blind casting in 15 mins. This is the power of culture and talent. I even got respect for this way of social psychotherapy.",10
Zzzzzz,"""Historical inaccuracies"" aside, I really only have two problems with this show:1) It is basically NOTHING like the book seriesand2) It is BLOODY BORING.5 stars for beautiful costumes, sets, and some interesting acting.",5
Sex education meets pride and prejudice,"This show is great, from start to finish I was hooked, as was everyone else I know. There is a brilliant display of diversity and it is nice to see actors/actresses, many of them, at the beginning of their career. It has the brilliance of being adult enough to show the 'taboo' of regular period dramas, but does so in a way that allows romance and escapism. Sure people may say there is little historical correctness but the bigger picture is that it is a beautiful series. Does it have some flaws? Perhaps. Every brilliant show does. But I thought it to be amazing and I cannot wait to see Season 2.
Also one word... SIMON.",10
Absolutely Loved it!,"It's disheartening so many people gave this show bad ratings because of the color of the actors. I have not read the books, but LOVED how they were able to rewrite it to include a diverse cast. The book is completely fictional, so changing it around to be a juicy diverse love story brings in more viewers. This was not meant to be a historical representation of the 1800's. For myself seeing people of color play Queens, Dukes, etc. was so nice and refreshing to see because our history was taken from us. Biopic's are cast to represent the true identity of a character and fictional stories are made for rewriting to bring in the masses. So, if you can't see past the color you need to take a deep look at the yourself as a person because you really missed out on a great show! Blacks, Asians, Latinos can play any role in a fictional show and guess what it does not change history, but I'm sure it made a young child of color smile to see people who look like them get cast for a role they normally wouldn't get cast for.",10
Refreshingly Different,"It's nice to watch something so different, with so much diversity, to anything else on TV, I truely allow myself to be so absorbed that I let myself forgot about the outside world for awhile, light hearted & witty with a twist of scandal and betrayal, and exquisite frocks to boot, love it!! 👍🏼",10
My first review,"If you don't like the cover for the TV show, please don't watch it. This is for people who want to have a fun time and marvel about the cimetagrophy, the customes and the pleasure of seeing a fantasy world with attrctive acors of diverse background. If yoU don't like to see an imaginary world where white and black people have equal status, do not watch it. If you don't like romance and steamy sexy scenes do not watch it. If yoi don't like period fictional dramas do not watch it. For everybody else who knows how to enjoy a reallly good tv show whose only goal is to entertain, then this is for you. Thank you to the team of Bridgerton and Shondaland for bringing this show. The ride was fully entertaining.",10
Don't listen to the nay-sayers,"I don't know why there are so many negative reviews, the show is fun, colorful, and very similar to Hamilton in that it's a modern cast in a ""historical"" setting. If you like period pieces, Jane Austin, romance novels, Hamilton, gossip girl (which to be honest I've never watched but it there's a storyline that is what I expect gossip girl to be), or even just shondaland shows then I recommend giving it a go.",8
Utter trash,"If you're expecting another Downton Abbey, look elsewhere. The characters are one dimensional, dare I say cartoonish? The plot could have been borrowed from any number teen dramas. I was mildly interested during the first two episodes but the same silly stuff kept being passed off as plot development. Finally fell asleep watching. I can't even work up,the motivation to dissect it further. I guess the Shonda magic is wearing thin.",3
Beautiful and a delight to watch,"I haven't enjoyed watching a show this much in YEARS. It has all of the ingredients of a great show: romantic, elegant, fun, sexy, great script and perfect casting, amazing music, luscious sets and costumes, beautiful, sweeping visuals. While Bridgerton is the first in its genre to veer sharply into steamy territory, it doesn't feel cheap thanks to talented actors and a strong plot. The use of modern songs performed by a string quartet is simply genius, and the music feels like a truly important component. There's an element of mystery with the identity of Lady Whistledown, which makes it great fun. I also admire what they did with the diverse cast. It's not meant to be historically accurate, but an imagined (and better) world. Cannot wait for season 2.",10
Guilty pleasure,I liked both seasons on one and two. This is a guilty pleasure show. I don't think too much about historical accuracy or cultural appropriations when I watch it. I just watch for fun and pleasure. It is more enjoyable that way. People exhaust me with the seriousness of their ratings lol. Just have fun with a tv show. Jeez.....,8
Loved this! Do not understand all the bad reviews...,"I really enjoyed this show. Loved it actually. Was it historically accurate? Nope but it's a fictional series so not sure why it matters. To be honest I didn't really get hooked until about episode 3. Was it a perfect show? No. Did I watch it all in 2 days? Yes. Was I sad when it was over? Very much yes. Daphne and Simon had great chemistry and I loved their story. Each character I wanted to know even more about. I laughed, I cried. I cannot wait for season 2 and the fact MILLIONS of people have streamed this speaks for itself. Give it a chance.",10
Bridgerton = Power,"I thought it was just fantastic! I cried, smiled, danced, and fell in love. Definitely my favorite show of the year",10
So so so so watchable,"No it might not be historically correct but greys anatomy isn't a real portrayal of hospitals. Amazing, bingeworthy, Swoonworthy - boshed it in a weekend. Loved it!",10
Where are the cars and mobile phones?,"If it is going to cram modern concepts in a Victorian fiction, why do a half assed job of it and not go all the way?",1
Fun and harmless,"It's a great bit of fun, harmless and entertaining.
I don't know why it get such awful reviews.
If you want historical fiction watch documentaries.
We enjoyed it and was super relaxing.
ENJOY",10
An exciting escape from reality,Forget about the historical perspective about this show because it's a truly great and fun watch. I enjoyed the characters because they have very distinct personalities and their own quirks. I haven't watched a show that truly captivated my attention and made me come back for more in a while. This show historical enough for modern viewers to continue watching and not get bored.,9
Enjoyable!,"I haven't read the books, but if you're looking for something extravagant and soapy, look no further! It's like if Gossip Girl and Pride and Prejudice had a baby.",8
Love!!,Obsessed with this show please please let there be a season 2 and more!!!!!!!!,10
What did you expect?,"It's exactly what it claims to be, a romance novel in tv series format. I love the characters, costumes, MUSIC, etc, and the plot, while that of a romance novel, was fun and had some surprises.Everyone needs to calm down, it's all in good fun!! Definitely Gossip Girl meets The Bachelor meets Jane Austen.",10
Gossip girl meets sex and the city meets an inaccurate 1800s England,"I could only stomach the first 15 minutes of the first episode. I could not get past the historical inaccuracy of having various ethnicities in high society and diplomatic positions. It just didn't happen in the 1800s in England, sorry. The narrator mimics the style of gossip girl to the T. The acting and dialogue is atrocious. The only positives are the sets and clothing. It seems this show is to appease those in the PC culture that love having a diverse cast no matter what the context, quality, or subject is. I have no issues with diversity but don't mix diversity with a historical setting that is grossly inaccurate.",1
Wonderful!,The season is Brilliant!Love the story!The cast paly their roles very beautifully!I think the best romamce season from netfilx is This!!!!Love it,10
love love the diversity !! very entertaining,Such a wonderful period piece ! it reminds of a marie antoinette lol but as a series! i just love! and the diversity in the cast is so refreshing and beautiful!!!! i'm obsessed with this !,10
The Bridgerton's - The Duke And I,"A true fan of Julia Quinn and The Duke & I was my first book read in her Bridgeton series and thoroughly enjoyed seeing the story come to live before my very eyes in Shonda/Netflix's version of this beloved Romance story! Loved everything about Netflix The Duke & I as the struggles were real for the mothers of girls as we had seen in P&P w/ Mrs. Bennett and making advantageous matches for their securities in a ""Man's World"" - The Duke & I delivered a stunning performance by a stellar cast of professional actors ... Lady Danbury & Lady Whistledown are two forces to be reckoned with ... The Duke & I deliver on a story worthy of Julia Quinn's imagination with pure visual delights ... Exquisite Costumes, Stunning Cinematography, breathtaking Choreography, and a well written adaptation of JQs novel of the same name. Thank you, Shonda Rhimes & Netflix, for allowing me to glimpse what the world of Regency period may have looked like with all the delights and naughty bits - I loved seeing Simon's back story and watching him realize through the eyes of love from his wife (Daphne) that he was a man of true worth - Simon never stood a chance from the moment Daphne bumped into (literally) at a ball - looking forward to seeing more of Daphne & Simon and the Bridgerton's ""Pall Mall"" game!",10
Whether you've read the series or not,Will Bridgerton change the world or your life? Likely not. That being said-it is a delightful distraction for the end of this year. Just what this doctor ordered.,10
Refreshing,Great acting. Perfect cast. Refreshing show. This show needs season 2!,10
Could be much better,"As someone who hasn't read the books, I would have loved it! But unfortunately, I read them! An amazing thing about book adaptations is the power that directors, producers, and the behind-the-scenes team in general, has to make something good (or something bad) into anything amazing, but that's not what they did. They took a masterpiece that is ""The Viscount Who Loved Me"" and simply changed everything and changed essential parts, like the fact that Kate only wants the good for her sister and Edwina wants to please the family by marrying someone with money to lift them out of poverty, and they turned a whole love and beautiful story into something petty. They made Kate look like a villain for taking Anthony away from her sister, and they made Edwina look like an idiot for not seeing certain things, it was all too bad!I must confess that some scenes were very good, it was much better than in the book, but to my displeasure, they were just exceptions. I don't think the series should be called Bridgerton when the only thing in common are the names of the characters (that's because many of them had sharp personality changes), Lady Whistledown and all its plot, the permanence of house names, and the plot of enemies to lovers, everything else changed, it would be much nicer for them to make a novel of any period without any connection to the book.",5
Do not just watch 1 episode!,It is totally worth watching the whole season. Rating shows after watching just 1 episode should be forbidden.,10
Best show of 2020,"Obsessed! I became very attached with each character and side story throughout the show. Cannot wait for season two. Beautiful music, costumes, acting, and storylines. I'm so hooked",10
Absolutely delightful,"I've read the books a few years ago and was amused by its wit and interesting plots. I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the books are finally being turned into a series. I have to say I am also pleasantly surprised by the diverse cast and hope I see even more of that in the future. Yes, this is not a dull British period series, we already have plenty of those. What we really needed was something light and funny and as further as possible from 2020.",10
Absolutely gorgeous!,"I havent been able to stop thinking about this show, the characters are so loveable and well rounded. Each episode it just filled with scandal and romance and its so much fun to get caught up in it. Fantastic show",8
Make your own mind up,"As did I. I would never have watched this wonderful drama if I had listened to the critics. I have not read the book, so I am unable to vouch for its authenticity but as a viewer, I was engrossed and captivated by the storylines, costumes, acting, sumptious settings etc. I binge watched the whole series and cannot wait for more. Many of the cast gave excellent performances the show is a big winner for me.",8
garbage filled with yawn inducing cliches,"All the raving reviews here say ""switch your brain off before watching"". perhaps i just dont know how to do that LOL. dont get me wrong, i'm all for fun to watch garbage shows. watched many of them on netflix etc. but this was not fun at all. riddled with cliches all over. and what they tried to do with a mashup of gossip girl and jane austen and downton abbey + sex appeal doesnt work one bit. it is actually more like an insult if you happened to watch downton abbey. im also not against imagined reality but writers need to be consistent and crafty with it. it worked in ""the great"" but it doesnt work here.",1
Truthfully romance,"It must be one of the first romances TV shows I've enjoyed so far. Firstly, all actors and actresses are incredibly talented and take their character to another whole new level.Bridgerton is refreshing, addictive, sexual and risky but on point drama mixed with romance!While on season 1 the truth about romance is told, exposing the British society, season 2 brings the sexuality and chemistry into a different level.",9
Challenges Your Assumptions,"A witty, subversive take on the Regency romance genre. The sets and costumes are sumptuous. Anachronisms abound, but I didn't really care. It's a lot of fun. Just enter Shondaland's universe and enjoy.",8
Entertaining,"Don't normally write reviews, but such low scores need some balance. Never read the books, didn't know about the controversial debates over casting until after I watched it. TV is what you want it to be - in this case an escape from reality. That's it, I wasn't looking for a history lesson, I wasn't looking for the meaning of life. I was looking for a distraction on a cold winter's evening - goal achieved! I laughed, I got annoyed with characters, I fell in love with some characters, and despised others. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea - but was something I and my daughter enjoyed together. Looking forward to season 2.",9
Awesome,"Perfect, the cast is the best! Wonderful to see my Bridgertons, all very beautiful.",10
I completely loved this series.,"I just loved the series, it's perfect so far. I've watched it twice since it premiered and the two times I watched the only thing I did was look underway to my computer screen. The adaptation brought of course many changes, but the essence remained. The main couple is perfect, Simon is wonderful. Anthony can't say the same and I wish he'd get better next season. And that Benedict and Francesca have a real participation in the series, not only in their respective seasons. It is not possible for someone so to have liked this work",10
I like Arianna Grande but.....,"First off, I would like to note, that I love Arianna Grande's music.That being said, I am also a big fan of period television and series. Period pieces have a tendency to take you back to imagining how life was hundreds of years go.... This series initially drew me in because it looked like it was going to be a good one!Everything seemed alright while I watched the first episode, but then half way into the episode, I was VERY weirded out. There is a scene where we see various violinists performing for the guests, and these violinists started playing ""Thank You"", by Arianna Grande.First of all, immediately I was ripped away from the fantasy of watching a period piece. It ruined the feeling that I was gazing into the life of nobles and ladies in the 1800s. I was handed a very crude awakening, that these characters were not in 1800s England, they were just playing dress up in the 2020s.I forced myself to go through the experience, thinking it was just a one off, but then, moments later, the violinists started playing another popular song from 2021 ( I dont remember the name), it was at this moment that I simply turned off the show, and decided never to watch it again.As I said earlier, its not that I dislike Arianna Grande, I really like her music. But when you are creating a show that is set in the 1800s, PLEASE dont ruin it by putting in modern day music. It really rips the viewer out of trying to believe that what they are seeing, ""really could have happenned in those times""",1
better than expectation,"Better than my expectation, i have to admit. the story flow quite good enough whilst the casts are not the superior good looking but lovely & adoring. cant wait to watch the season 2",10
This is historical fantasy....,"Historical fantasy and period romance are a fantastic way to reimagine history. Episode 4 really hit me hard. It gives you the imagery you always wanted....costumes are fantastic....and then gives a depth I search for in reading romance books. Yeah I wasn't exactly sold on the main romance...mostly for the woe is me whining of the privileged couple madly in love. Luckily you have a whole cast and menagerie of storylines to follow and invest in. I can't wait to see what happens for these characters and I wholeheartedly love the boldness of saying WHAT IF we hadn't bound entire races of people in enslavement, social inferiority and servitude....where would we be today IF we had had an equality movement nearly a century earlier. Also the queen is a kicka*# character and I could watch her comedic performances all day...not to mention her turn for the drama",8
Not That Bad As They Say,A very Good Drama you can enjoy. Drama Genre Lovers can Surely Give it A Try.And it's not everyone's Cup of tea,8
LOVED IT,Beautiful history and beautiful colorful. l love this romance,10
I love everything,"I wait 5 ages for this, and I love so much. Penélope & Colin are the best couple forever!!!",10
As bad as I thought,"I knew I'd hate this show and I did. Any show that tries to lure an audience in with sex in a modern day vibe has to be lacking in everything else. Seems like it's trying to do the stuff people thought was cool ten years ago. Explicit sex has become boring because there's too much of it. Stop lazily thinking it's ""what the audience want"". Maybe; but it has to backed up with a good well directed story. I hated this show. I hate hearing scripts trying to sound modern when people clearly wouldn't have talked that way. Plus isn't all the hype around it suspiciously over the top?",1
Fine For Its Genre - Romantic Relationships,"Just enjoy this series for what it is. The author has a great understanding of human nature, and uses it explore all aspects of romantic relationships. It's something of a mystery to us even today. We do want to fall in love, to stay in love, to find that love is the ultimate reason for a lifelong commitment. In this piece piece, we watch some fall by the wayside, we see some endure. None are perfect, nor do they have to be. But if you find it interesting to see so many factors contributing to and complicating peoples' love life, then this one's for you!",8
Amazing Fresh Adaptation of The Bridgerton Series,"I love this series.It has brought all the characters I love to life and I spent 8 hours enjoying the opulence of Regency life, the loving and maddening Bridgerton family, the scandals, the extra story plots giving the characters more depth and of course the passion.The creators have made a brilliant job of bringing Julia Quinn's stories to life and giving a fresh, enticing feel to them.I will always love the books but this series has made them come more alive in my imagination now.Now for the long wait of series 2",10
Impeccable.,"Bridgerton is impeccable. Soundtrack. Actors. Story. The 1800s are magnificent and bringing her to the screens made everything more incredible. The romance as it is portrayed together with the love of the family, its brothers, in all is an impeccable set. It is worth highlighting the actors' choices. Simon. It's. Perfect. Too anxious for a second season and Anthony's story. Netflix + Shonda = quite a hit. I loved it.",10
Highly recommender,"If you like sensual romances with great cast and amazing music, incredible dresses....It is your show. You will fall in love.",10
Great characters other than The Duke,"The character development is extremely strong, the plots are tantalising, but The Duke is the most frustrating human in the entire world.",8
"Cringe, cringe, cringe","I watched it because I got super curious by all the hype made for this show. God! Barely endured the first episode. What is that, really? Is it a ""past meets today"" kind of thing; is it a mockery to the British royals; a dark comedy; some type of weird modern adaptation?? All I think of was ""cringey"", sorry. The plot of the show is not bad actually, but the execution...Could have been way better.Also, I couldn't comprehend what was all that hype and being at the top for weeks about. Even the chemistry between lead roles do not match.",2
Amazing,"As someone who has not read the book, I throughly enjoyed it. Don't listen to the bad reviews and give it a chance!Not your typical drama",10
Gossip Girl + Jan Austen,This period drama is the perfect mixture of gossip girl and Jane Austen. The costume and sets are beautiful with stunning. The plot is fantastical and so unexpected that it leaves you hanging in suspense at the end of each episode. The conflicts and romance replicated in this period drama gives the watcher some historical perspective of Great Britain in the 1800s whilst balancing it with a nice mix of romance including some steamy scenes.,9
I Loved,"I loved the series completely, the way Simon developed and how he was completely the same as the books, the actors are completely wonderful, I never imagined I would become a fan that easy, the friendship of Penelope and eloise captivated me from beginning to end, completely true to the books.",10
"A jolly jape, not to be taken seriously at all. Let it wash over you.","This is a good entertainment as long as you do not take it seriously for a second, and simply accept it as it is; a good old-fashioned soap opera with no historical accuracy whatsoever. Light-weight, superficial characters, a feast of ballgowns and glamorous decor, meaningless dialogue, bodice ripping soft porn. Total escapism. Lap up every silly second. Lots of gorgeous male totty on display. What a lovely way to get through life - simply throw a ball when all is looking desperate and gossip endlessly about all your neighbours. I loved every silly, nonsensical minute of it and moved on to Queen Charlotte immediately for more delightful tosh. Enjoy.",10
Interesting romp but historically dubious,"It's definitely watchable if you don't mind the repeated bonking towards the end which gets annoying after a while and there is no way on this earth that a regency duke would be talking to a debutant about masterbation! If those two comments put you off then it is not for you. I like the large non white casting except on one point which is referencing the King marrying a black woman where as Queen Charlotte was definitely not and she was also much more in love with her husband and genuinely distressed by his condition than this rather callous and wholeheartedly unlikable character is. Cast a a black women in the role but be colour blind to the casting as in David copperfield, don't rewrite history to make a point. If you want to understand a better history of the era then watch The Madness of King George which is closer.",8
Why pay for the rights to a book series if you arn't going to tell the same story,"It's common for some changes to works given budget and time restraints but it seems like every change to the story was because of some absurd pc ideology that undermines the whole point of the series.There's nothing from the books besides the name
I think they did this cheesy, poorly written, and poorly acted fantasy nonsense and then bought the rights to the book and named this nonsense after themselves. Just don't waste your time, i'm going to watch some jane austen movie to clear my eyes.",1
Intriguing,Intriguing twists turns who knows who who said what?? Excellent watch to do exactly what TV was made for to entertain!!! Takes you back to a time & place of history. Give it a try you won't be disappointed.,10
Sooo good,"SOOO GOOD. Every episode had me on the edge of my seat. The costumes, acting, music, everything was perfect. I also think it is great how there seemed to be a hint of Pride and Prejudice. I really hope the next season comes soon.",9
Captivating,"To each their own, Accurate or Not, Enjoyed every bit of it, Though there could have been improvements in some of the acting but overall was OK. I Also wondered about the choices of people of color set in that time but understood it to be in a ""typical world with all things being equal"". Regé-jean page is a brilliant Actor",10
Binge worthy,"I am having too much fun watching this show. I love the diversity, the costumes and cinematography are beautiful. It's not something to watch with kids in the room ladies so make sure you make some ""you"" time and enjoy a good show. Please see it for yourself instead of looking into these negative reviews, everyone has a right to their opinion but make the decision yourself",10
Bridgerton is amazing,"This show is absolutely amazing!! I can't stop watching, definitely recommend. Love all the characters. We really need a season 2.",10
Odd costumes,"It might seem odd to focus on the costumes when there is so much else odd about this, but... Think of the exquisite costumes and jewellery used in the most recent ""Emma"" and then compare it with this.
At that time, muslin was the fabric of choice for young women, in white or very pale colours. In this, all the colours are garish, and the clothes for the older women are frankly unbelievable. I've never seen so much bosom heaving.Everyone is wearing huge mounts of tacky jewellery, which is all over the place in terms of period. Some looks like 1950's Woolworths - but there is simply too much all the time.Then, morning calls. I'm pretty sure that young men did not call round to see a named young lady the morning after the ball in the way they are queuing up to do here. I don't often feel pity for the actors but I did here - it was so cringe-making.The people putting this together have seen a few film adaptations of Jane Austen but understood nothing about the period or the manners.",1
Hooked by episode 2,"I don't normally like British shows, but I kept hearing such good things about Bridgerton, so I tried it. It took me a couple tries to get through the first episode, but I became completely immersed somewhere during the second episode. I love it.Pay no mind to the hateful, misery-filled 1 star palookas. You know who they are.",9
Excellent,"I am shocked on the bad reviews of this show. I loved all the characters and found it very entertaining. The costumes were beautiful, the dialogue was witty, the chemistry was palpitating at times. I admit my favorites scenes were with Daphne and Lord Simon, I felt their connection and left me wanting more every episode. I actually plan on rewatching the series again!!! Its worth a watch!",10
"It's entertainment, treat it as such","Let us speak of a simple truth. If you are ok with people waltzing to Shawn Mendes 200 years before he was born, ok with women in their mid-30's playing young teenagers, ok with huge anachronistic liabilities yet are not ok with a black duke, a black Queen, an interracial relationship, a black man with a white servant, then you are a racist. Whether you like it or not, you are a racist. Grow up.",10
Simple yet beautiful,"It's a simple sunday love story where you sit on your couch on a lazy sunny sunday, after a big lunch and a wonderful desert waiting for sleep to take you away.... Yet you won't fall asleep because, as fictive as it might be, this story is filled with so much colour, you desperatly want to see more. At least this is how I feel.
And... OMG!!! Sorry for the spoilers but that love scene?? I am old fashioned and that scene truly fascinated me.
It makes me want to crave more for the respect a man should have towards a woman and the kindness a woman should have towards a man. Both should cherrish each other. I hope one day I will find this kind of passionate love and respect.",10
Crying real tears,"I've been reading some bad reviews so I wanted to say that this show did exactly what it was supposed to do. IT ENTERTAINED! The goal wasn't to be historically accurate the goal was to be an intriguing tv show and that's exactly what it was. When I started watching it I stayed up till 5:30 in the morning to get as far as I could. Complex characters, regency era (be it a more exciting version), and great sex scenes. What more could you ask for???",10
Awful production...,"Yeah, pretty much what everyone else is saying here. Every show these days has to make a statement, but I'd rather remember the past and the vile attitudes people of that time had. I don't want to see it glossed over like it never happened... what next? A WW2 movie where the holocaust never happened and everyone just gets along?Plus the production on this series is a joke. Anyone else notice the yellow lines and parking bays on the road in the first episode!? Lol! How on Earth did that get through post.The CGI cities look like an Xbox game, very flat and unrealistic lighting.As for the story and acting... yawn. I'd need to be paid a large sum of money to sit through the rest of this drivel.",1
Best of 2020,"This web series is the best web series of 2020, in terms of love story, please release season 2 quickly.",10
"""wow, did not see that coming"" moment","Waiting all season to see Julie Andrews unmasked as the Lady Whistledown and then it's little Pen. I do love a ""wow, did not see that coming"" moment. All though hard to follow, it is not an easy watch. The cast each delivered good performance for the 1800's but stand out performances for me came from Elrose, Antony and Lady Delacorte. Nice touch with making modern music instrumental to suit the era. All in all not a show I will watch twice but I'm glad I did.",10
Amazing Chemistry Between the Two Leads in Season 2,"""Bridgerton"" Season 1 was not my favourite, but I was very impressed with Season 2. ""Bridgerton"" Season 2 shifts focus from Daphne to the man of the house, Anthony. I really appreciate that the writers chose to focus on Anthony because he becomes much more likeable once he takes centre stage. We understand why he acts the way he does regarding love. Most of it is rooted in his grief from losing his father 10 years before. Anthony was forced to become a man much too early.We are introduced to Kate Sharma, a ""spinster"" who also lets her familial duties come before her own wishes. Like Anthony, she is stubborn, loyal, and family-oriented. Queen Charlotte names Kate's sister, Edwina, the social season's ""diamond,"" to which Anthony takes an interest in courting. Throughout the season and in his own words, it is clear Anthony does not wish to marry for love because of his ""family first"" mindset. However, that may just be an excuse to mask the true real reason behind his refusal to marry for love - his fear of loss.Kate and Anthony's longing gazes and moments alone display their immense chemistry. I do not think I've seen such an abundance of on-screen chemistry between two characters other than Kate and Anthony. When the two are alone, the orchestral crescendo matches the rising sexual tension between them. The serious and dramatic tension is accompanied by cute and funny moments, such as the pall-mall scene. A good romance will have both. Additionally, there is chemistry between the entire cast. You can tell they like one another, which really shows that chemistry transports on and off the screen. This season is a ""slow burn,"" which seems quite a different approach from the previous season. The slow buildup of ""enemies to lovers"" archetype, while a cliche, is entertaining yet.Sometimes, period dramas can get boring, but I did not need to fast-forward any scenes in Season 2. Cinematography, acting, and screenplay are 10/10. I am heavily anticipating Season 3, which will place Colin and Penelope's romance to the forefront.",10
More please,"I'll be honest, i don't watch many Shonda Rimes shows. I find them to be not quite my taste for reasons you all probably don't care to know.But this? This is just soapy enough to be fun and substantive enough to keep me interested. This is witty dialogue that relies on.....witty dialogue. This is strong female leads that rely on other strong females to keep them going. This is what I always hoped a Rimes show would be.And since it's based in a series of books where each heroine gets her day, we (hopefully) don't have to worry about too much soapy stuff interrupting our prior heroines happily ever after in the seasons to come.This is a fictionalized England where where you can suspend disbelief and reveal in the world created for your enjoyment.",8
My favorite regency show,"I fell in love with this family in the books and now on tv, even thought they changed a lot of things, the essence of the books are right there and I thank the creators alot for bringing my imagination to life!",10
Boring,I don't have much to say except I stopped watching it after 3 episodes. I tried to like it but there was nothing to like.,1
Gets good,"Took a little for the show to really get going, but you can't help but get wrapped up in it. Very good.",8
Lovely,"Wonderful series, with very nice casting and special plot.",9
Loved it!,Absolutely loved it. The show is romantic and emotional with excellent acting from the two leads. They are passionate and the chemistry is palpable.,10
Binge watch worthy! 10 Stars!,"The plot and the story was very entertaining and utterly romantic. I was hooked from the get go and there wasn't one dull episode the entire season. The diverse cast was so refreshing and I ABSOLUTELY loved it. Binge it or watch it at leisure, it's worth your time for sure. I'm definitely rewatching it over again!",10
Bridgerton,"The series is IMPECCABLE! from the costumes, photography, soundtrack, the representativeness of the cast was wonderful and the cast itself is incredible ... it's just all perfect. a series to cry, have fun, learn from the characters and their evolution. I can't wait for the second season. it was all AMAZING !!",10
Plot?,"What plot? After the first couple of episodes, you realize there is absolutely no plot. The actors do well with what they've been given. Unfortunately, the story is absent. This is quite a bore.",3
Terrific Television!!!,"What a amazing story of siblings trying to find love and romance while trying to avoid big scandles,lying and cheating. A great romantic drama show with a great cast, characters and costume design. The music how they use today's music for the show is amazing! Definitely worth watchingTimothy Treakle.",10
Love this,New look to an old story.. I love it... such a treat...music score is a bonus,10
A series worth watching!,"If you enjoyed Downton Abbey, you will probably enjoy this series.. Situated in England, although different eras, the two series take us back in time to the grandiosity and richesse of 1800-1900s, with the gowns, accessories, balls, waltz and palaces..
I would give the series some time, since the first episode can be confusing with the large number of characters, names and big families. Yet, once you get acquainted to the characters, you will fall in love with their acting
Despite being only 10 episodes, the characters evolve tremendously. The acting of the 2 main characters Daphne and Simon is beautiful! The two characters embark on a very complicated journey, yet evolve and grow together. Obviously it was clear where their friendship was heading: starting with a cold ruse, into a beautiful friendship, to only move into passionate love, lies and true and complete love at the end. The progress of the couple felt almost impossible at times, and I think that's what made it convincing.
The secondary characters, such as Eloise, Colin, lady Danbury, Anthony, Marina and Penelope add a great touch to bringing variety to the series. Eloise is revolting, while all ladies her age should think about marriage, she doesn't! Anthony is involved in a forbidden love. Marina is pregnant from a true love yet is not married yet. And so on.. these characters bring us the reality underneath the perfection painted through those balls and gowns. We are and will always be humans, with lust, desires, but also shame and mistakes.
I love the mothers character, who despite making mistakes was juggling her 8 children alone, as a single parent, trying to balance between the duties and roles that the era demanded from her but also having her own values and principles, believing in true love.
Finally, lady whisteldowns character added a true twist to the whole plot (a little like gossip girl) where aside from all the action and intrigues, a main mistery remained all along. (Although I should admit, it was easy to unveil her true identity)",9
Midway through and the sex begins,"Loved this series. The two leads did not have a lot of chemistry but their sex scenes were hot hot hot. There is a lot of eye candy, well done to the casting department.",8
Love it!,"In coming across this show, I binged the whole first season one episode after the other and I'm excited for more! it kept me intrigued. The actors do a great job, and I feel like this show does a great job in giving a glimpse into a historical period of time. Well filmed. Great storyline. I highly recommend!",10
Silly and unrealistic,"I like dramas set in a past time period. I like dramas set in the same period as Bridgerton. However, after watching the first episode of this series, I can't bear to watch more. It's not just that the characters are out of place or that it's so unlike reality it might as well be set in another world. It's also really poorly written. The characters are flat and unbelievable.",1
Created an account just for this review,"This series astonished me in every way and left me inspired, happy and full of emotions.
First of all to the diversity of the cast, because it is the first very obvious observation: It is not accurate of course, we all know that. But seeing another and better version of ""our history"" is a powerful thing, one that I felt and loved.
About the plot: It is basically ""gossip girl"" playing in the 19th century but with much less teenie drama and much more real emotions. The way the picture the sexuality of the characters is truly new to me and as much as a fresh breath of air as the diverse casting.
I haven't read the books and I know it can be hard for screen adaptions to live up to one's expectations. I can't comment on that. But without having read the books, this ist a truly new, strange and inspiring series with a great love story I would recommend to all my friends.",10
Amazing!,"I loved this show! People need to understand that it is not a history lesson, it's fun and romantic, as it should be. And I loved they took the opportunity to showcase amazing POC talent playing parts that had not been usually portrayed by them.
Shonda is a genius.",10
Love it!,"Julia Quinn's ""Bridgerton"" on Netflix is a great adaptation of her work. Moving any book to the screen the writers have to select certain aspect of the storyline to keep it moving. So always remember the books are the books- the series is the series and never the two shall meet. Casting was done spot on!",10
Thoroughly enjoyed that,"I thoroughly enjoyed that. The chemistry between the leads was incredible. I just don't understand the negative reviews about lack of historical accuracy - it's fiction, enjoy it for what it is. A tale of love conquering all",9
good,"Very good work this is a very good ,overall a good movie and we all like it",10
The is no spirit of original book,"It's like a bad played parody, not enjoyed, not recommend.",3
So much fun,"Yeah it's dumb, but it's also fun and so well produced. Not boring trash. Great actors and writing. And I hate this TYPE of content and I love this. Highly recommend. Some great up and comic talent.",10
Romance that feels good and that also feels right,"If you used to like romantic movies but, in this day and age, stopped caring for abuse, sexism and harassment considered romantic in our old classics, well, this is for you. Feels good without a false note. There was (almost) never a moment when I thought, ""this is stupid"" or, ""argh, come on, they just need to communicate better"". (Aren't these moments the worst??)Anyway, beautiful actors, performances, direction and costumes. Fun all along.",10
Great show!,"Love the casts, love the costumes, love everything❤",10
"So far, so great!","No, I haven´t read any of the Bridgerton books. But I have understood that there are some differencies between this TV series and the books. I really want to read the books because I think that ""Bridgerton"" is a charming, well written, enjoyable, amazing and nice TV series! Usually the famous saying goes: so far, so good. But I must repeat the title of my review: so far, so great!People might have some huge issues with this TV series modern interpretation. But I´m perfectly fine with that. The first and second season of Bridgerton have made a lasting impression on me. I have rewatched some scenes circa 50 times. Yes, you read that correctly. Lady Whistledown is my profile picture on my Netflix account. Why? Because I am a huge fan of writing. I have also watched and liked ""The Netflix Afterparty - Bridgerton"".Do I have a favorite character in this TV series? Maybe Lady Whistledown, Daphne or Kate? But honestly I must say that I like many of the characters in ""Bridgerton"".I´m looking forward to the third season very much! I hope that it will be as great as the first two seasons. Fingers crossed.",10
"Fun, easy and silly - thoroughly enjoyable!","Don't watch this if you want a real feel period piece. The amount of angry reviews on here because it's ""inaccurate"" are astounding. I personally loved the fact that the Queen was a black woman and that the love interest was an incredibly gorgeous black man.It's a fun and gossipy version of the elite in England, where all cultures are mixed together to create a spicy and daft world. Definitely had a Gossip Girl feel with the ""gossip rag"" but with Julie Andrews narrating, it makes it charming, rather than vicious.It's beautifully bright and colourful, with fun quirky characters and an enjoyable love story.I binged the 8 episodes in one go. I'm not sure what could be added to it with a season 2 but nonetheless I'll watch when it comes out.It's an easy show to watch and overall enjoyable if you don't take it seriously.",8
Who were these characters??,"First off, I couldn't care less about the diverse cast. The actors who played Simon and Lady Danbury were great. But the personalities for Anthony, Violet, and so many others were just...wrong. I wasn't a fan of the addition of Mr Featherington, or the boxing they included.
And why has no one mentioned the absurdity of the royalty plot?? Why was that needed? Ruined the whole thing for me.
The fleshing out of the other siblings was nice, but it also left a lot of blank spots in Daphne's development.",3
If Downton Abbey and Gossip Girl had a baby...,"If Downton Abbey and Gossip Girl had a baby in 1813...you would get Bridgerton. Being a fan of both of those previous shows this one dazzles. First off, the setting, sets, costumes, and color scheme look great. I think the cast did a great job, I really felt immersed in the show and time period. I especially felt immersed into the Bridgerton family. The first episode made a big splash for me...definitely curious to see what comes next!",9
Quirky and addictive,To those who complain about the diversity of actors not representing history- well you have had a whiite Jesus and biblical heros on your screens so you can't really complain about a few black royals,9
A series totally worth to watch!,"A lot of people misjudged the series saying that it does not meet the real period. In fact, the showrunners did not want that. I really enjoyed watching this series. The plot is so interesting and the costumes and decors are just amazing!
You can easily get attached to the characters and their story. Beautiful series totally worth to watch!",10
Solid,"A good Netflix show, The reviews on here are being way too harsh, it was a solid show.",10
LOVE THIS SHOW,Woww this season 2 has been so so ...hot. Anthony is super hot in this season lol Kate abs him ughhhhh I've rewound parts because they are so intense.,10
Season 3 : No !,"As someone who really loves the show and been waiting for this season since the moment the last season ended I expected so much, unfortunately so far season 3 is not delivering.First of all we only have 4 episodes which cuts our enthousiasme right in the middle.Second, this seasons could've been the funniest with a quirky Penelope and a Colin becoming obsessed with her as she progresses but we don't much of that.Spoiler : the kissing scene was bad for my opinion, we needed build up and more time of that scene, more sensuality and more close ups to their faces their stress the intensity of that moment and the moment Penelope says thank you I laughed cuz that was not even a kiss for my opinion.Third, if Eloise turns out gay I'm stopping the show and no turning back. Like I wouldn't mind any other character to be gay but not Eloise !!!!And finally I feel the cast were not convinced nor invested in this season, there's no flow in the progress of events and unfortunately and unexpectedly I'm disappointed.",4
"Fun, simple, romantic series","Bridgerton is a fun, simple and romantic series. The costumes and the atmosphere are very nice. It takes you away from your daily life and ensures you a chilled and lovely evening.",9
Its not supposed to be Jane Austen....,"Ok, reading the reviews frustrated me. Many people think this is a Jane Austen take like Sandition. Bridgerton is a book series by Julia Quinn. If you want to be super technical, Jane Austen's novels were mostly before the Regency period. She lived from 1775-1817. The Regency period was 1811-1820.That being said, romance novels, including Regency, are not grand literary works like Austen. They aren't trying to be. It is a guilty pleasure genre with various degrees of steaminess. They are fairly predictable and fun reads. Though period pieces, historical accuracy isn't the #1 priority. It's fiction. That being said, Queen Charlotte was very likely mixed race.Speaking of race, this is a Shondaland production & Shonda Rhimes is known for the inclusiveness. There's no way she would ignore Queen Charlotte's lineage, and I think she used that as an opening to add in the inclusiveness. Not to mention, viewers like seeing themselves represented. By adding a diverse class, more people are willing to watch. Same goes for the color schemes- especially the Featheringtons!If you've read the books, you'll still love it. My mom read them before watching it & after watching it, I've read most of Julia Quinn's bibliography. We both loved it. Yes, some liberties have been taken, such as adding characters & side stories and making Daphne a blonde ""incomparable,"" but it doesn't take away from the stories. I think the added side stories actually make us more invested in the characters, building up the excitement for the next seasons.All in all, don't take the series too seriously. Just sit back, swoon, giggle, and enjoy!",10
Enjoyable,So good so far. Not understanding the bad reviews. Truly enjoyable,10
Season 2 is So Much Better,"I wasn't a huge fan of Season 1. Maybe it was Daphne's baby bangs. Or the cringey sex scenes. I watched the full season, but my reaction raged from meh to ugh. But Season 2 has me hooked. The chemistry between Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Sharma absolutely sizzles. The music continues to amaze (You Oughta Know!). Now I'm in.",8
Are you serious 1???,Why all of you take it so seriously? It is a really enjoyable series with nice production and beautiful act from main characters! If you are not into that kind of series about 1800th century or fairytales don't add it to your list. Bridgerton surely doesn't worth 1 out of 10 rating I see in reviews.,9
Fantasy???,"Surely this should be listed as FANTASY? I have only seen trailers for this show and fond them to be absurd. After checking out the creator of the show, I was not surprised and resolved to avoid watching at all cost.",1
Fan of Julia Quinn,I love Julia Quinn love stories. Usually the book is awesome but the movie or series it is made into is not up to the mark. But Bridgeton is exceptionally well made. Couldn't stop after watching the first episode. Can't wait for the next season. Guys be quick.,10
Great Story,Appalling casting. Simon is cast with someone vastly more attractive than he is in the book. The entire Bridgerton family is cast by someone whom has never seen attractive white people. Daphne is portrayed by the most insipid girl I have ever seen. Why? I'm wailing. The Bridgerton brothers are attractive at all. There are dozens of more attractive men you could have chosen. Lady Danbury rules!,10
Don't listen to other reviews!,Absolutely enjoy the entire show! Completely binge watch the entire season in one night. Was highly enjoyable. Hope there is another season.,10
Not one of the haters,I actually liked it! A little too much nudity but still can't wait for the next season. Nice to have something with a different genre than cops or medical shows. Refreshing in Mt opinion. Probably will watch it again while waiting for season 3.,10
Bridgerton a breath of fresh air💞,"@shondarhimes @netflixFinally a film which reflects the fact Black people also existed in the royal courts of England & through out Europe. Athough Bridgerton is fiction, a good start to research, document begin telling real history on film.",10
Boring,"It would have had a nice edge to it, with its quirks and over the top colours and characters. So within this whirlwind of frivolities, schemes, and balls, yet another cumbersome story about motherhood/fatherhood and the inevitability of it all, it was not only preposterous but completely out of place.",1
Loved it!,"Pure escapism, a fresh adaptation from a young ladies perspective. The sets, costumes and hair were breath taking! Bravo, I loved it. Penelope stole the show for me.",10
Grabbed my full attention and wouldn't let go,I could not tear my eyes away and I'm usually on my phone watching a show but this grabbed my full attention and wouldn't let go! If you want the same old period drama then there are MILLIONS out there for you. BRIDGERTON is the period drama for us who are excluded from those other stories. We deserve a happy ending too!!! I can't wait for Season 3.,10
The best kind of mindless tv,"Very distracting and interesting! If you're looking for escapism TV, this is the show (and boom series) for you.",10
Delightfully entertaining!,"Loved it all, very binge-worthy! Every period piece does not have to be Jane Austin. The acting was excellent, costumes were beautiful and scenery exquisite. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",10
Stunning !!!,"I absolutely love This series !! The characters, the dialogue the characters have with each other, the diversity of the whole cast , I love all of it !My girls wanted me to watch this so I binged it, it hooked me immediately. I've always been drawn to time period dramas. And Bridgerton does not disappoint!! Can't wait to see S3. I am so excited !S1 and S2 were riveting, and as accurate as possible for that time period. The costume attire was completely stunning, It's irrelevant that in that time period, as the diversity the cast the show depicts, was non existent.I find it well done love !",10
Awful,"Unbelievable plots, poorly written dialogue. A great disappointment.",1
Electrifying...,"Bridgerton is beautiful and romantic. The aristocracy truly believes they are civilized while treating women like chattel. However, Bridgerton has given women the autonomy to create their own destinies unlike other historical dramas that portrays women as weak and needy.I love Lady Danbury is gorgeous, bold, and does not take no for an answer. She's the pencil that connects all the dots.The men are fickle and lost and in need of attention. A nice change from the typical period romance dramas.Cheers!",10
I dont understnd the negative reviews...,It's awesome.. its bingeworthy.. loved the chemistry between daphne and the Duke..,10
This is a show that I wouldn't recommend watching with your parents.,"Produced by Shonda Rimes comes Bridgerton a TV show set in the Regency-era England seen through the eyes of the powerful Bridgerton family. The show focuses on Daphne Bridgerton and her journey to finding herself a suitor during the social season. She quickly becomes the favoured 'bell of the ball' but unfortunately, the suitors aren't quite to her liking, meanwhile the Duke of Hastings has returned to London to settle the affairs of his late father he doesn't have any interest in finding himself a wife but fate has other ideas!While the social season commences a new gossip paper is discovered called 'Lady Whistledown' giving everyone daily updates on who's pursuing who and any other scandal that presents itself throughout the season. Think Gossip Girl but with a daily newspaper instead of text messages and instead of Kristen Bell for a voice-over you get Julie Andrews... which is pretty awesome!One of my favourite parts of Bridgerton is the balls, like full-on dancing balls... not only are all the locations phenomenal and extremely gorgeous the costumes are incredible and the music is often contemporary music played by an entire orchestra some of the songs that play throughout the series include 'Thank You, Next by Ariana Grande', 'Bad Guy by Billie Eilish' and 'Wildest Dreams by Taylor Swift (this one was my personal favourite).The costumes on this show is absolutely stunning and not going to lie it made a corset look very appealing! The guys on this are extremely good looking and I haven't seen any man pull off a top hat and mixed patterns like the men on this show do!All in all this show is incredible and as this is based on a book series with the first season representing the first book there could be up to 8 seasons. I can imagine there will be plenty of nominations for the upcoming awards season and all the actors and actresses are well deserved.This is a show that I wouldn't recommend watching with your parents though. There are plenty of steamy scenes that don't leave much to the imagination and as someone who did watch this with her parents I definitely will be watching the second season on my own. Unlike Gossip Girl you don't have to wait until the entire series is over for the mystery, you'll be sure to discover who Lady Whistledown is by the end of the season! I highly recommend everyone watches this especially if you are already a fan of Shonda Rhimes.",8
Absolutely fantastic,This show is beautiful and anyone who thinks otherwise is wrong.,10
Amazing!,"Amazing!! Already watched it twice !
Really well done, I recommend to everyone who wants to dream a bit",10
Identity politics everywhere,Looks like the world just wants to hate Anglo-Saxons. Not even allowed to be an ethnicity anymore. I'm sick and tired of it. There is nothing redeemable about color washing white history out of spite.,1
Period fantasy drama,Fun and entertaining fantasy drama. Perfect diversion if you are a romance fan.,9
Please read,"Season one was absolutely phenomenal.... Season two boring....it dragged and the music was Mediocre compared to season one. Simone Ashley needs more acting school. I did not feel the chemistry between her and the lead role Anthony. I cannot connect with season two, and I really tried however it just was not memorable.",9
"Simply ""Wow""","I've just binged this in 2 days (between children high on sweets and presents). Definitely not for someone who likes history to be just so but otherwise it's wonderful, colourful, intriguing and full of life. All the characters are played amazingly well and just like a good book you feel fully submerged in their world. I was sad when it ended and I will definitely be watching it again.",10
So foolish and lovely,"You can see that the jewelry is fake, the costumes have nothing to do with reality, but if you don't take it seriously as I believe it is intend to be it is quite delightful.",8
Loved it!,I've read all the books and am thrilled with this telecom series. Season 2 can't arrive fast enough.,10
Review from a Julia Queen fan,"I liked the cast, but the drama is hard to understand. Why the creators brought Queen Charlotte to the scene? Why Marina and all the fuss with the opera singer?
It was confusing, it made the plot slow and heavy.
Simon is so freaking HOT, but not even him could save this disaster.
Eloise was so annoying, and the costumes... This is a nonsense.
A terrible waste of time. I hope they do a better job for the second season. Julia Quinn and her characters deserve better.
And the music... horrible attempt.",1
Not for historians or people with lack of imagination,"If your are looking for a historical drama based on true events and facts - this is not for you.This was so much fun to watch. The characters, settings, the wardrobe, colours, movement ...the storytelling so imaginative, but can assure this fantasy, this fiction changed my days.We are now in the middle of a pandemic 2020-2021, with restrictions and bad news arriving everyday - do we really want to watch something linear and sad and heartbreaking?We want to watch something that jump-starts our imagination, that makes us giggle, laugh and blush.Haven't read the book and expect it to be as catching as the series or more (because thats the way it should be).",10
Lovely bit of fluff. Takes your mind off the seriousness of theses days,I loved this. A movie to watch and just feel good. Watch it enjoy it . Take time out to live in a fantasy world where love wins.,9
A colossal love story.,"Netflix brings to our TV an amazing love story wrote and created by Shonda Rhimes which shares the story of a family the Bridgerton seeking to find love in London s high society. It is temporarily located in the XIX century so the costumes, settings and also the music will create a special atmosphere that will keep you captivated. Short Note: The music from the series are songs that you can listen to everyday on Spotify or even radiostations adapted to the XIX century vibes, amazing!But what is more interesting about this are the love stories that this show delivers.In Season 1, Penelope falls for a Duke, the most charming Duke you will ever see, as she discovers the perks of being a woman in love.In Season 2, the love triangle between Anthony, Kate and Edwina will keep you entertain, and some Kathony scenes will make you weak (trust me, chemistry is assured).If you are a fan of love storys mixed with royal issues and a lot of gossip, this is your thing for sure.P. S: Cant wait for S3!",9
Intensely romantic and sexy,"Bridgerton is not without its flaws. The plot is weak at times, but in general the acting is good, and it is a pleasant entertainment for those looking for a soapy romance story. The highlight is the intensity of the romances, that peaks in season 2 I must say...the increasing romantic and sexual tension between the leads is amazing and I hadn't seen something like this for a very long time. There are scenes that made me weak in the knees... For this alone the series is worth the watch if you are craving for romance and a handsome smitten hero to fantasize with.Regarding other aspects, I didn't care much about the historical inaccuracies. I take this as a fantasy story, so I'm ok with everything.",9
I just love this show,"Before I start, I'd like to say I love period piece movies/shows. I was skeptical since I don't like Gossip Girl or other basic teen girl shows, but Bridgerton is different.After 15 min I was hooked. The chemistry between Rege-Jean Page and Phoebe Dynevor is undeniable! The casting, costumes, set, editing, and acting are phenomenal. Just give it a try.",10
Shaka Zulu,"Political correct BS.It's like remaking the Shaka Zulu series, only this time they casted white actors for Shaka and his tribe.Totally unbelievable.",1
Gossip Girl of the 1800s,"There are so many poor reviews for this show and I don't know if they are honest or harsh! Either way, I don't agree, at least not completely. Bridgerton is certainly not the best show, but it was filled with enough drama, scandal and comedy to keep me gripped throughout the series. The costumes and set were absolutely beautiful.",8
This has made a mockery of this site,The most watched. And loved series ever .gets low reviews get a grip ...,10
It is worth watching,"I liked everything in the series. The actors were wonderful, the music, the conversations, the story itself and everything else were wonderful. I really enjoyed watching it. I Totally recommended from my point of view. Waiting for season 2.",8
Never heard of the books...,"I've tried watching other period pieces because they have high ratings but found them boring. After considering this one for a few days, I decided to try it. The brightness of it, the colors, costumes, hair, everything is absolutely stunning! That's what drew me in. My thoughts very shortly into it were that it was an early 19th century Gossip Girl. I would say I'm sure the writers, directors, producers intended it to be that way. As someone who's not read the books (never even heard of them until the show came out), I don't have that to compare it to, but I enjoyed the show very much. I don't care for the ""gratuitous"" sex as most others have stated either but that's one of the things usually found in this genre so it didn't throw me off so much. I loved the show - it was gripping at times and visually beautiful.",10
Renaissance period,"A moment to visit back in the Era of Renaissance, or say Regency Era of London when there is way to select brides and grooms, shame and family honour is top priority, King and Queen have powers and nations were united over the wedding, Brighton is one such family they are in search of perfect groom and eldest one fall in love after several accidents with Biggest catch of the place and what started as a fake alliance turn into love but due to Prince Friedrich insecurities things fall apart and Daphne get pregnant was the issue, Bridgertons 8 cousins were all set for marriage but will they find love, and things got problematic when one of the cousins whose love is at war died and she have to find another groom to support her child and she went with his brother, and most of them enjoyed there time , Finally all ends well and few find there love and mystery remain unsolved is Mrs.whistledown, but lets see what season 2 got for us.",8
Culture appropriation,"If this is not considered culture appropriation, then it's because of double standards.Bridgerton is a silly masquerade, where anyone can dress in a costume and claim they are whomever they want, without merit.A worthless, even damaging lesson for people anywhere, but especially in the West, where entitlement is considered a virtue nowadays.I gave up watching it after a couple of episodes; it spews nonsense, for which I've had my fill from news and social media.",1
"Good - but with obvious flaws, which predictable disappoint the audiance...","I Iike Pen and Colin, the tough Eloise, the spice of the other Featherington sisters, the warm hearted Bridgerton mother and the entertaining ceo-like Featherington...The beginning seems fine - they are on a good way... I liked that Pen wanted to have her own ""glow-up"" shine, so a good hearted man would pay her the respect she deserves...On the other hand Colin seems to be a good one in the previous seasons, self-sacrificing and open for a good woman, which did not worked as planned... And even he talked bad about Pen behind her back (because he thought it does not matter in front of the dirtbag-guys who have their own simple minds and it was the easiest way to get them quiet - not nice, but possibly everyone knows this), he seemed to be a good friend and no playboy...So, the last season ended with Colins wish to see the world and the new season starts with his return from the trip... There would have been many possibilties how to use this for the new season - most likely he found out what matters in life, found someone one his trip or returned and found someone in one of the first Episodes which build up parellel to Pens maturing...That was not the case... Even it seems for audiance at first that he believe in what he says and wanted to teach her what he would appreciaten from a woman, it came out he did not follow his own words and just did this for Pen because he is not busy with his own non existing search for a good wife (and? Because he has gilt feelings that Pen heard what he said, like - no, no you understand me wrong, I will show you)...Moreover the audiance get the feeling at the first episodes that Colin search for a woman and does not find the right one at the events that fit to him (they all act like silly groupies in front of a handsome guy)...In fact he liked the attention, just as much as he liked to vistit woman who charge per hour - it is a kind of frustrating that this is the development he achieved at his trip - not cosmopolitan, not someone who matured - came out better and want that share after his return... Just someone who learnd that you can satisfy your needs everythere one the world...The thing with Lord Debling - as others stated out... You may think he is really interested in Pen and has only eyes for her - even other women try her best... It seemed that there would be a ""showdown"" between Colin and the Lord as the seasons reach the middle - but no... Moreover without the last scene between Pen and the Lord on the stairs (wild guess - which was one of the scenes who was reshot or added due to fact that the creator noticed that the season is way to dark and unsatisfying - the official reason why the season did not air earlier)... Without this scene, you as viewer could think in reality he did not care about her feelings at all and if you think further, he just saw in her ""the safe choice"", the woman who would be overjoyed to find someond who would marry her, the woman who would not do any attempt to find someone else when he is away for years, the woman who is not know for to be courted in the past anyway... And that even more look like if Pen was not his first choice, but leave a woman like Cressida for three years alone at home could be a kind of risky - so he saw Pen as the best horse for him and put his attention on her...There were a lot of changes in the ton of the season in the fourth episode - like, Netflix ordet a season with 8 episodes devided in two Party, we have to hurry up, make progress and throw a bone...As also mentioned from other - there are sidestories that I did not need in a 8 pisode season which took an eternity to air and has to last for an eternity until the next season...I hope in part 2 is way more essence as shown in the trailer... Is it really that big deal that Pen is Lady W., is it really necessary that Eloise threaten Pen... I mean, it was not that big deal for Eloise in the first episodes of the season and she did not tell anyone, even she was resentful... When she saw how the people treat Pen, no matter how hard she tries - Eloise felt kind of sorry for Pen...Eloise was the one who talked about ""the project"" Colin has with Pen - which spreaded more and longer when everything Pen wrote - with was not nice but not without reason, as Eloise should have notice during several events... At the end Eloise should know that Pen has a pure heart and an her longtime friend search for real love, something what is not common in portrayed society of the show, just look at her friend Cressida... For me, this ""Problem"" is probably made up to much in the next episides...Last guess for a good twist (who did not read the book - is the baby challange part in the book at all or just made up for show?!) - Pen become pregnant really soon and is the daughter who give birth to a boy at the end... ;)There were also a lot that I like in part 1 of season 3, until now 8/10 maybe more for part 2...",8
Pure entertainment!,"The best thing about this show is all the snowflakes that have gotten their noses out of joint because it's not the cookie cutter grey and drab regency that they are used to. AND those who are purists of the novels and expecting the same story, beat for beat, as in the books. And I say that as a reader first and TV watcher way behind that.Season 1, despite the many problems I had with it, was much more enjoyable for me, but I still liked season 2 also. Unfortunately, I found the two leads in season 2 whilst certainly delivering solid performances, to me were much more akin to live theatrical performances where everything needs to be exaggerated, rather than small screen ones.",10
Beautiful and Sexy!!,"I absolutely LOVED this series!! For me it was an amazing ride of love, challenges and desire. The character development and writing was phenomenal. The scenery and music were absolutely divine and fun! Such a unique and titillating period drama!! I will watch it several times over and if there is a second season to come, I will excitedly anticipate it.",10
"Ignore the 1 scores, they do not get it.","This is a truly magnificent show that many people just do not understand.Let me explain. This show is not historically accurate and was never meant to be, it is a light hearted look at the autocracy of it's time. In order to appreciate it you have to set aside the thoughts of black rich people and Indians who would not perhaps have existed in this time and set it in an alternate universe. Once you do that it becomes .........
A marvellous light hearted look at the gentry of the early 1800s. It has many interweaving stories of love, lust and betrayal, in amazing settings and fabulous costumes. Slip your historical mind into natural and go with the flow and I guarantee by episode 3 you will be hooked.",9
Pleasantly Surprised!,"1800's Gossip Girl with infusions of modern day references. I'm enjoying this series very much! (On episode 4)Also, to the one reviewer that was upset that black men and women are in this show as dukes, queens, princes, etc. you are the prime example of subconscious racism. Very disappointing.",8
Not good,"Nothing redeeming about this show, why even call it Bridgerton when it completely butchers the story beyond recognition",1
Impecável,Fiquei impressionada com a produção dessa série. Já era apaixonada pelos livros e a série superou todas as minhas expectativas!,10
Enjoyed the 1st season,Unlike most of the other reviews my husband and I both liked it! We are looking forward to season 2!,10
It's perfect!,I loved how they managed to get the essence of the characters from the books to the screen. I loved the scenery and the clothes as well as all the excitement as everything is presented. I loved it so much and I'm looking forward to the 2nd season.,10
Do not understand the 1/10 reviews,"This show is a breath of fresh air. Feast to the eyes, royal, colourful, entertaining.
Enjoyed the show so much, made me buy the book. After having read it, prefer the show to the book.
I rate this show 9/10. Because 10/10 is perfect and Bridgerton is not. But it certainly does not deserve 1/10.",9
Stop Thinking what it should be and have expectance,"I am shocked and saddened to hear the other reviews, because it has ""Africans in it."" Art is subjective, and movies and TV and be created in anyway. If you can't get past the diversity I'm sorry but you are the problem of the rest of us not moving forward in society. This is the stuff Prince Harry and Megan Markle are trying to change. This show has great harmony, great acting, the Cinematography, and music selection very good. Costumes are exquisite as well. This piece really shows at the end of the day being diverse we still have gender issues in society, but it also shows that we can progress. I find this show charming makes you yearn for more and give at shot! Please give it a shot wiht out I'll judgement.",8
... two-strikes... another one looks like it may be coming,"... for a production so centered around the two leads, having one of them signed on for only the premier season makes little sense ... a sweeping love story ending as it is beginning ... then to have that actor mismatched to such a degree with the other principal of the story makes even less sense ... Dynevor & Page never really look like they belong together & their intimate scenes show that ... they never truly produce the sparks that are supposed to be flying between them... now for season two he's gone, after all the setups for a continuation of the future between them ... Netflix has an increasing-penchant-reputation for producing shows with glitches.. & now one that must begin anew with a replacement not expected by viewers... producer Shonda Rhimes said of the series ""our goal is every season, having a couple (viewers are) obsessed with, and you (can) believe we're not going to see more of their story next season, because we're telling a completely (different) love story every season ... there are eight Bridgerton siblings, and as far as I'm concerned, there are eight Bridgerton seasons"" ... that's a lot to ask of viewers, we'll see how that all works out.",5
It's just entertainment people,This mini series is meant to be entertaining...not Jane Austin or historical accurate. It's that simple...those who are bashing it are trying to complicate this fact. Where not talking about a historical period piece here. These are based on modern romance novels..nothing more!,9
I'm in love for this show!!!!!,"Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique.",10
started off with promise,"7.5 this started out refreshing with some interesting characters including the Queen, the ""aunt"" who looked after the main male lead character and the gossip. But they can only do so much. I will say that having a mix of races at all levels of society just felt right. And it also shows how jarring it is to see people of colour relegated to tokens or maids/butlers in other shows. These are all made up stories anyways. Show some imagination. Since any glorification of historical periods is BS and none of the ""historical"" shows in the past have shown reality for 90 percent of the human race.The intelligent sister was more interesting than the main female lead Daphne who was dull in all ways. And the main male lead was barely interesting. The first half of the first season was far better than the second half. Some negatives include those two main characters who were flat and uninteresting. I thought for sure it was going to turn out that he was illegitimate anyways since the housekeeper mentioned that his mother had trouble getting pregnant and needed ""some good strong seed"" (implying that it was the asshole father Duke senior who was barren). One can always hope that this far more interesting plot twist will come to fruition.As well, the pregnancy and fall from grace for the visiting cousin was ho hum. Also the opera singer romance also boring. Sorry was she supposed to be a version of the hooker with a heart of gold? Maybe if more was actually shown as to how she became an opera singer? What that life was like instead of just professional love interest to men of means.This show would have done well to hire the writers from Jane the Virgin. IF the plot is to be constrained then the character development must run the show and insipid leading ladies and men isnt it. I gave this an 8 but only is worth a bit over 7 and that bit is for the elements I mention at the top.Final note: was this written by the current young generation who thinks they have invented sex and want to show off their new toy? Every generation goes through that. The irony in this case of a historical fiction is delicious.",8
Brilliant,Completely hooked from the first episode. Can't wait for season two!,10
Perfect!,"I loved!
It's perfect. I love the book and LOVED this series.
I need a new season.",10
Political correctness gone mad,"Oh dear...I normally love period dramas, but this one is so contaminated with political correctness and virtue signalling that it's nauseating. Yes you know what I am talking about - the abundance of non-white characters in senior roles partaking in ballroom dances and being lords and ladies. Totally made-up and totally false. The lefties are trying to re-write history and pretend that there were black lords in England in the 1810's. They're brainwashing youngsters into thinking that ""Oh look, we've always been a multi-cultural country.""
The defenders may claim ""Oh, but this is not meant to be totally accurate portrayal of the era"". But imagine if in a period drama, set around the 1820's, if rather than horses and carriages, the Victorian characters drove cars everywhere - would you not lose total credibility for the show? Same principle here with the diversity. Oh, and before anyone uses the 'R' word on me - I'm non-white.The only thing missing in this joke of a drama series was a BLM fist symbol in one of the classical paintings on the wall.",2
Perfect!,"The plot of the tv show is amazing, is a typical shondaland show!",10
Beautiful Setting,"Lovely series. Binge watched from 5PM to 2AM Saturday. I haven't read the book so I couldn't compare. Love Eloise and Daphne. Love the unmasking, didn't expect it. Decent acting. Can't wait for Season 2.",10
Very much enjoyed,I'm definitely not a romantic movie or tv show viewer but I really liked this show. Binged it in 2 days and a month later I'm rewatching it again. Season 2,10
Superb storytelling,Excellent period drama with wonderdully written intertwined stories. Watched it all in 2 days as it was utterly captivating!,10
What's with all the hate?,"I adored this show!
It was something different and something for the senses!
If you're into period romances, this is definitely for you!
If that's not quite your style, maybe give it a go anyway?
Go in with no expectations and just enjoy it for what it is!
Don't listen to the haters - listen to the fact it was one of the most streamed TV Shows of December 2020! (For good reason.)I'm off to buy the books!",10
Waste of Time,I started the first episode and found it boring and stupid. One of my friends said that I didn't give it enough time. I watched more episodes. It never got past stupid. Most of the characters are portrayed as idiots.,1
really enjoyble,After looking at all the negative reviews here i almost decided not to watch it but for those of you wondering whether to watch it or not i say go for it and decide for yourself. The chemistry between the main leads is sizzling which is always fun to watch. Even the entire cast is thoroughly enjoyable.,10
Very interesting and unique,The thing I love about this show are the characters and the modern music adapted into the Elizabethan era,9
Impressive,"I don't typically watch these types of series; however, it was my wife's turn to pick our next series to watch so I tagged along. We were both very engaged and impressed by this series. I don't know why so many people are giving it such bad reviews. I thought it was very well made and entertaining.",8
Loved it,"I haven't read the books so came to this series without any expectations and I loved it. The story line is good, it is visually beautiful and the cast are great. It has everything you want for a weekend watch. I binged this in a day and now I'm sad it's finished.",10
Excellent Binge Worth Entertainment!,"I don't understand all the bad reviews. I thought it was an excellent story. Predicable and not historically accurate, but both the books and movies are complete fictional. So I don't think historically accuracy is really that important. Even though it's in the late 1800's, I love all the diversity. There's a feminist character and gay characters. As well as a good mix of racial representation. It's a bit like pride and prejudice.
There are characters you love to hate and characters you'll just love. This is a series I'll probably watch more than once. It was very enjoyable.",10
A caricature...,"An absolute caricature of 19th century Regency Britain; clearly written and produced by Americans. The BBC does it much better! Ironically, I say this as an American, but a strong Anglophile. The gratuitous sex of season one was luckily waned down in season two. Season two at least has an interesting dramatic arc. Though I still struggle to find the true dramatic benefit in revealing Lady Whistledown at the end of season 1. What I don't understand is how these actual British actors somehow sound like they are putting on an accent. I watched this out of curiosity and clearly word of mouth interest.",3
"Amazing, fun, romantic, historical, lovely!","Now I'm watching season 3 the newest one. From the episode 1 until now I'm in love with everything that is connected to this amazing stories of all characters. I also recommend to watch Bridgerton serial about Queen, even more lovely story! What here is not to love? Actors, costumes, historical places and traditions are perfectly fine present to audience. So I can compare this to Anee with an A. It's just kind of serials you can watch it over and over again and never being bored. I'm not giving spoiler but if you like this part of our history it's perfect for you. I hope they will film at least tree seasons more!",10
Perfect!!!,"Like a huge fan of the books I have to say that I'm delighted with the show. It's absolutely charming, modern, beautiful... So happy with the result, so happy about de whole crew, actors, actresses, directors and specially shondaland team! Thank you all for this show.",10
POLIN IS EVERYTHING,Wow. Just finished the last episode to the first half of season 3. All I can say is wow. At first I was bored of this season but then I came to realize it was all a build up of my favorite love match in the Bridgerton series yet. These two are everything and more. I felt so bad for Penelope when she was being criticized and mocked but this actually makes her realize her worth and sets her up to fully embrace love. Colin has glowed up so much and so has Penelope. I love her character evolution.. And can we talk about that carriage scene? I may or may not have rewatched it three times already...,10
Enjoyable but kinda disappointing,"It was a good show, enjoyable to watch and definitely binge worthy. But they changed a lot of the story from the book to make it more drama filled and scandalous. And they took out 2 very endearing parts from season 2 / boom 2 that I loved. And 2 huge changes from season 1 / book 1.",8
"Enjoyable and fun to watch, historical accurate it's not.","Bridgerton is not Jane Austen, a docudrama based on real life or even Downton ABbey. Bridgerton is a highly fictionalized soapy romance series, set in the Regency period. It has a good storyline, beautiful costumes, gorgeous sets, with lots of eye candy. It is historically accurate, absolutely not. It's a fun watch and enjoyable.",8
Like a cheap supermarket paperback romance novel.,"1. I'm not interesting in idle gossip and backstabbing and this is HOUR upon HOUR of it.
2. The sex scenes are so cheesy and overdone and sometimes take up the entire episode.
I tried to watch but episode 7 was enough.
3. This show doesn't empower women. It shows them mostly as nothing but liars but also attacking one another, gossiping about one another, using sex as revenge ?! Doesn't seem very empowering or 2020.",3
I liked it very much,"I'm not hyper critical expecting the show to be historically accurate in time period representation. I like that the casting is diverse and they don't feel the need to make a big deal out of it. I thought the show was a great escape during a rainy weekend. If you like period pieces, give it a try and ignore the people who nitpick every little thing.",10
MUST SEE,"Awesome show hope Season 2 comes out soon.!!
You will love for sure it has twists and turns",10
Totally worth all the good hype,"Binge watched this show and enjoyed watching it. Binge watched agin for the next few days.
To me it was Jane Austen, Gossip Girl, To all the boys mixed in one. And it was highly entertaining.
The dresses and the dance and settings were a treat to the eyes.
Eagerly waiting for season 2",9
Remember: this show is based on HR novels written by a current writer.,"You will not find the same sweeping safe romance of Jane Austen here. Instead you'll find a show that is based on books that are quite steamy and full of wit, humor, and a good amount of sass. I loved S1, so I decided to listen to all of the books on Audio. I've since fallen in love with the family- even though the show deviates from the books a lot, the general story is the same and the differences (especially in S2) have only kept me on my toes. It's worth the watch. Light hearted, romance lovers will rejoice!",10
Pure joy. Just what the world needs now,"Clearly this isn't Shakespeare. It is supposed to be light people! But it's an incrediblely enjoyable, very well made, beautiful looking, fantastically soundtracked series. It's fresh, it's fun, it's often got surprising balls. Just what the world needs now. Delicious escapism. Cant wait for the next series.",10
Miscast,"British aristocrats being played by Africans and Idians... completely ridiculous if that wasn't ridiculous enough, the plot and writing are worthy of a youtube amateur soap opera, and the acting is hammy because netflix makes these aberrations, skip this garbage.",1
fell in love,Honestly to say... I fell in love with this series... the characters.. the dialogue... the dress... the location... the chemistry... absolutely divine..,10
Obsessed!!!,"I absolutely love this adaptation. I've read the books and Shonda has brought the characters to brilliant life. The music, costumes and sets are breathtaking. I can't stop watching. Can not wait for Season 2!",10
ONE OF THE THE BEST DRAMA SERIES FOR 2020!,"This was a wonderful multi-episode series! I realize that some things in this movie may be far-fetched, considering the period setting of the1800s. But the characters are believable and enlightening. If you like love stories where each episode is so wonderful that it leaves you wanting to binge-watch the next episodes all day, then this movie is for you.",10
A beautiful love story in the early 19th century,"At first glance, I didn't expect Bridgerton to be so well directed. It was beyond my expectations. The choice of casting is excellent. Phoebe and Regé are great together, and they really delivers authenticity and realness in their characters as Simon and Daphné. Their British accents empowers the scenes. For me, it was their entrance leading them to their first dance as they form an attachment, which really catches my breath away. The decor, the fireworks were mesmerizingly epic. The music and the soundtrack really comes along very smoothly and captivating. Even the script was astonishingly well-written and you completely felt emerged into the show. At the end of the day, it's a really beautiful love story based on true feelings, conversations, and the way Phoebe and Regé portrays their characters. For one minute, you might feel like they skip their characters to reveal their true own personalities and it really enjoyable and unique to see. You learn what's really important in life, the little things, details that really matters. In season 2, Anthony and Kate were perfect for each other. I truly much enjoyed watching them playing their characters so well. They bring so much love, humour, great conversations and it was a real flow of state from start to finish. Their first meet up on horses were great, going to the balls, dancing, the wedding scene, to the end bouquet finale was just fantastic. The music definitely plays along well. Also, Eloise and Theo were lovely. I think the upcoming seasons are going to be marvelous too.",10
This is strictly for the romance in season 1,"This series allows for loopholes, and every one is taken. Having said that, the romance is unique in the scheme of things. When one reads a book it's not imagined that the characters are not pictured in the mind of the reader. Then again, one can be so engrossed in the words. It's imagined Shonda shocked. You'd never know the romance is old fashioned from the synopsis and if you haven't seen it but only heard about it. One can't know a music artist from 10 years ago but can know the regency era apparently. This work of pure fiction in the era of oxymorons such as 'historical fiction', is nothing more than a marriage where the partners don't stiff each other. It swept general audiences and spawned a unicorn: an unofficial Grammy winning musical apart from it. The synopsis and some echoers make today feel like 1813. You maaaaaaad is what needs to be said to 'accurate historians' who don't even know what people's favorite musical artists were, 20 years ago without tricky google. They think there was only one race back then and only one race could achieve and be rich.",10
looks like a parody,"The only emotion I managed to have watching this was LAUGHING I LAUGHED A LOT! If that wasn't enough, the plot, the writing are equally terrible and the costumes are artificial that look like they were made for a children's theater it could be set in the present time which would be just as silly but not as fanciful as that J. A is turning over in her grave.",1
The past and the present,"This is a must see series!! AAAA++++ writing, directing and acting!! ! I absolutely love the music and the story line! I recommend it to all my friends and co workers. The way they have mixed the music of today with the lifestyles of the past is brilliant. It was beautifully done! And you can watch this show without having to try and understand their language and speech. We talk about it so much! I hope they make more episodes!",10
Sexism at its worst,"But we do love it don't we. Bridgerton is without question the most absurd illustration of 19th century aristocracy ever portrayed on any screen, large or small. It's painful to even think this was actually any kind of reality.However, there are several redemptive qualities that come to point, one of which is the colorblind casting. The other is Lady Whistledown. Whatever would we do without her? She is the one character who reminds us of just how ridiculous it all is, eloquently expressing her opinions that can even help us formulate our own. Well, I don't need much help there.One thing of particular interest here is the fact that in the vast majority of mainstream gay themed movies and such, lead characters are portrayed by straight actors. In this case however, it's refreshing to see that a lead male hetero character who has great difficulty keeping it in his pants, is actually portrayed by an out gay actor. How's that for a little gossip? Take that Lady Whistledown! Sorry if that ruined anyone's fantasy. The integrity of the character is well maintained through superb writing and a gifted actor. Eventually it will be ok in Hollywood to avow one's sexuality without destroying their career.Overall, this one must be taken with a grain of salt, lest we fall into the shallowness that is this production. If you're going to engage in this tale of historical nothingness, take it for what it is.",8
Love it!,"If you were a fan of the books you will love it. If you have never read the books you will also love it, if you like period pieces, specifically Regency. They did well in choosing both actors, sets and costumes. Good grief the actor they chose for the Duke is seriously swoon worthy! I love that they have Julie Andrews narrating as Mrs. Whistledown. Also, if you like to binge watch this is an easy show to do so with. Can't wait for the second season!",10
"Romance novel, not history lesson","This show really captured the FUN of Julia Quinn's work. While I did find the diversity of the cast to be a bit blatant, the story moves right along as of their skin color didn't matter. I REALLY liked the portrayal of Simon once I knew the writers weren't adding in some background of African roots. Just the actor's skin color; no big deal.
Costuming and sets are gorgeous. It's a bit fantastical rather than perfectly historical, but it balances nicely between the two in a nearly believable, but still fun, way.",9
Loved every minute!,"I have read all of the books and the movie was beyond my wildest expectations! Loved the actors, costumes, storyline, etc... I can't wait for the next season!",10
Nope.,Nope. Just nope...more of the same nonsense. Can we just fast forward till movies and shows become good and more importantly accurate again?,1
I recommend,"Is a pretty good series, I recommend it to be watched as a couple with your girlfriend, girlfriend, wife. It is very well made and the atmosphere of that period is wow. I recommend with confidence especially for couples.",8
Amazing Wow,I Loveeedddd the Storyline. I cant even believe there r so many bad reviews on this . There is so much diversity within the cast too and they explained that this show wasn't an actual reflection of the time (obviously). The people who left bad comments on this clearly didnt read the description on the show or saw that it is a romance . They call it cringeworthy well then why bother watching it . It was rlly great . see for yourself . Acting was also amazing. recommend,10
I enjoyed this and I find it hard to enjoy series like this!!,"I just love how the families and the details has comed through. The chemistry between Simon and Daphne is just stunning. Also I liked the other characters. I see lot of people misliking this series, but I found it entertaining and easy to watch. Give it a try :)",10
nice dog,"Ee I heard of Moon Knight, but never really knew the hold story, but then I saw the first episode on Disney plus, and I gotta say I'm excited for what comes next. Oscar Issac really takes us on this journey, playing like a Cary Grant like style.",9
A Breath of Fresh Air,"I will admit, I have not read the books, but that's okay because this isn't a book review. As for the television series, it was captivating! The sets, wardrobes, etc. were precise and obviously created with precision. The actors all hit their mark and played their roles exceptionally well. Just like any story, you learn to love and hate a few of the characters.The series was exciting to watch and I wanted more as soon as I finished the first episode! I wanted more love, more lies, more sex, more betrayal...all of it!For those reviewers upset about POC playing queens, dukes, and high-class individuals, get over yourselves...it's fiction for goodness sake. This isn't some biography or documentary.
Yes, the story does include historical elements; however, most viewers comprehend that what we are watching was soley meant for entertainment, and entertained we were!",8
"Saturated colors are pretty, but that's about it.","This show is a prime example of money thrown towards sets (elaborate), costumes (MANY), wigs (most ugly), etc. At the expense of poor acting, writing and story lines. The music tries to be hip but lacks.Season 1 was bad mainly due to lead female.(boring)Season 2 is worse mainly due to lead male.(over acting)All of the acting tends to be very bad, along with the direction.Saturated colors are pretty, but that's about it.",1
Not Your 1990's Jane Austen Adaptation,"(In short... Book lovers should go in with an open-mind and Jane Austen lovers go in not expecting an historically accurate regency romance, but a fun modern twist!)If you're expecting this show to be a BBC Pride and Prejudice or Emma series, you will be sorely disappointed.
Bridgerton mixes modern society with a Regency backdrop. With it's diverse cast and orchestra versions of modern music, it has a very fresh and modern feel while still having most of what you love about a good Regency romance.
Being an avid reader of Julia Quinn's novels, I tried to watch this with an open mind, knowing book-to-tv adaptations will not be 100% true to their original stories. Though I thought the narration and overly-posh character's of the first episode of Bridgerton to be a bit over-the-top, the show does settle into a nice rhythm come episode two and onward.
The showrunners and writers really do capture what was and is so special about the Bridgerton novels' stories and characters while bringing in bits of other Bridgerton books and new characters and side-stories to fill out the show.
I really enjoyed this series and seeing the characters and I know and love being brought to the small screen. Very entertaining, sexy and fast paced all with beautifully designed costumes and sets. I binged all 8 episodes on Christmas day and I am ready to watch it again! I for one can't wait until season 2!",9
Amazing Story,"Bridgerton"" is a visually stunning and entertaining period drama that captivates viewers with its scandalous storylines, witty dialogue, and exceptional acting. The show is set in 19th century London and follows the lives of the aristocratic Bridgerton family and their interactions with the scandalous Lady Whistledown. The cast is diverse and talented, and the costumes and set design are a feast for the eyes. While the show may not be historically accurate, it is a delightful escape into a romantic and dramatic world that will leave viewers eagerly awaiting the next season.The series revolves around the romantic pursuits of the Bridgerton family's eight siblings, particularly the eldest daughter Daphne Bridgerton and the dashing Duke of Hastings, Simon Basset. The show explores themes of love, betrayal, class struggle, and societal norms.One of the unique features of ""Bridgerton"" is the anonymous gossip columnist Lady Whistledown, who serves as the narrator and voice of the societal commentary throughout the series. The mystery of Lady Whistledown's identity adds an extra layer of intrigue to the show.Overall, ""Bridgerton"" is a visually stunning and engaging series that offers a fresh take on the traditional period drama. Its diverse cast, modern sensibilities, and captivating storyline make it a must-watch for fans of the genre and newcomers alike.",9
The pop music of period dramas,"If the likes of Outlander and Poldark are the classic music of period dramas, Bridgerton is the pop music of period dramas. It's catchy. It has a good beat and you can dance to it. But it lacks substance, layers, and depth. I thoroughly enjoyed it as a one-day binge but it can't touch the nuances, depth, and historical accuracy of other TV dramas set in the18th and 19th centuries.",8
sigh...,"I loved it!
the heroine got a little annoying at times, but the lead hero was very swoon worthy... loved eloise and her search, the clothes, the multi culturalism (maybe racists you can try pretending its an alter universe where people are just better in general...). its awesomely mushy, but not too silly and the sex scenes are hot! but man are there a lot... especially when you are watching it with family and youre like 'maybe i should watch this alone... in my bedroom... with the lights out...'
anyway, i loved it and highly recommend it and i am not a typical hallmark holiday romance watcher- i like a bit of grit and intrigue...
(i gave it 10 stars to counteract the racists and their many extra/fake accounts... id probably give it about an 8).",10
"You will ""burn"" for this love story","""Tale as old as time"" - those of us, who enjoy romance novels, have often read this or that interpretation of one and the same love story. Young man troubled by his demons comes to terms with his life, with himself, through his growing love for a girl. He is rich and handsome;she is beautiful and pure. Bridgerton's plot is predictable, happy end - mandatory.What is unexpected is the absolutely mind-blowing on screen chemistry between the main characters!!! It was pure joy to watch the development of their romantic relationship in this reimagining of 19th century British high society - racially diverse, so colourfully dressed, not at all historically accurate (who cares!!!). I do not get why so many people are upset that Bridgerton failed to portray Regency era with historical precision. That was not the plan all along. What makes this series so unique is that it allowed creators' imagination run wild and free. Except for the love story - the pulse of the show, the centre of Bridgerton universe. Simon and Daphne will pull you in and leave you with a happy-dreamy smile on your face at the end of the final episode...reinforcing the idealised notion of romance. It is total escapism and a hard blow to gray reality. It is great entertainment.",10
It's a miss,Terrible casting and even worse acting. The whole thing does a fun book series a disservice. I am disappointed.,1
A triumph for book-to-TV adaptations and a boon for female-driven period romances,"It takes a clever team indeed to take a historical romance book series, which focuses on the happily-ever-after one one couple per novel, and make it into an ensemble cast with a strong through-narrative. Yes, many changes were made when comparing to the source material. Yes, the costumes and events aren't meticuously period-accurate. But the unique effervescence of Julia Quinn's Bridgerton family books is what has been brought to the screen. The decision to offer a female-focused, female-gaze perspective to Regency life, sex, self-actualization, and identity in love is what we needed from this new historical romance series. The spirit and overall arc of the characters is what Van Dusen and Shondaland have given us, and that is what matters most.",10
PERFECT,"Incredible actors, wonderful production, great script and does not deserve the racist attacks he has been suffering, because it is a series of FICTÍCIA history and not historical (based on real or historical facts, but yes fiction). Accept that there will be black protagonists YES! AND ALL ARE GREAT ACTORS.",10
Addicting,"This was never my genre, but wow did this show change that! I put this on almost nightly just to fall asleep to. The soundtrack was surprising and so good it's in my playlist now. I have now been buying the books because I am addicted to it now! I highly recommend this show, even if it's not normally your type of show to watch, just give it a chance, you might get hooked too!",10
Love Bridgeton,Love Bridgeton they worked so good I think I think that it was amazing to see a curvy woman like Penelope And Colin I love their different love stories I I am looking forward to Penelope and Colin story and all the other too.,10
What Daydreams are made of!,"This show is what Daydreams are made of. What young lady wouldn't want a handsome Duke to escourt her around town and dance with her at all the parties? What woman I've never had this day dream? The gowns are exquisite! I even found the men's clothing to be beautiful. The storyline is an age-old tale. The music modern in a classical sense. I can watch this show over & over. If you like a fairytale, watch Bridgerton!",9
Absurd,"Absolute hogwash. Never, never, never in Georgian society. Yes, it's fiction, but even fiction has to have some resemblance to reality especially when it's HISTORICAL fiction. (If not, why didn't they put Michelle Pfeifer as one of the slaves in Roots? If they did, it would have be utter nonsense and absurd. As one reviewer wrote, why not ""add every other race and not only black people."" But I disagree with this reviewer, that the inclusion of black actors was due to the producers being Americans. I've watched movies made by British that also suffer from what the reviewer calls ""diversity."" I think this movie is a reflection of how diseased our world is now. When an historical fiction has to strain so much for fact that it becomes a travesty of History. Pity.",1
AMAZING!!!!!!,This might just be the best series of 2020. SEASON 2 IS NEEDED!!!,10
Fav,I love it all can't wait for next season....I researched it over again .can't get enough,10
Beautiful Bridgerton,Loved the series! Better than the books! The characters are faithful to the spirit and I loved every moment.I hope Netflix does right by Shondaland and keeps this running for all the books!,10
A very nice surprise.,"Even though I am an enormous Regency fan I had never heard of these books, let alone read them. I'll admit that the first episode was a bit disconcerting since I didn't know anything about the show before seeing a short trailer, but I soon realized the genius of the casting. The actors are well chosen and play their characters with believability - isn't that all we really need? I laughed, I cried, I fell in love with Daphne and Simon. And especially with Lady Danbury. I'm going to see if I can download the rest of the books and I'll probably be up late tonight, reading more about my new favorite people and seeing them all in my mind's eye. I cannot wait for season 2!",8
Another WINNER by Shondaland,"This is one of the BEST shows on Netflix of anywhere for that matter. It has it all. I watched the whole season in two days it was so good I couldn't wait to see what was next. Its juicy good fun. Cant wait for season two! Those who gave it a negative review OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T bother to even watch. It is Netflix's most watched show of all time. Scandal, lust, love, secrets and diversity. Together it makes a wonderful show.",10
Cheap and amateurish,"It's not that hard to condense Regency literature into a TV series or film. After all, it has been done many times before to high standards.I seem to recall Shonda Rhimes saying that content should mirror the world we live in. But Regency Britain is the past, and I can't imagine why she didn't just deal with the world we live in right now. Never mind that ""the world we live in"" is vastly homogeneous, depending on where you are.What bothers me most about Bridgerton is the lack of regard for historical accuracy even beyond the casting. The dreadful clash of colours in the costume and production design made me think I'd tuned into Britain's Got Talent by mistake. Do they care that most of the pigments needed for those garish colours were not available in the early 19th century? I think we all know the answer to that.This series displays some of the worst hair, make-up and costume I've ever seen on any British-made production. This is what happens when some people behind the camera, especially the stand-by crews, are untrained. But in the case of Bridgerton, I suspect this is actually intentional.If you want to watch period Brit series with black or ethnic characters that make historical sense, I'd recommend Taboo or even The Mill.For those who just love the artistry of amazing costume and make up teams, 1995's Pride and Prejudice, Mike Leigh's Peterloo or Mr Turner, Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility and Howard's End are perfect. In fact you'd be safe with anything shot before 2010.",1
Wonderfully romantic and brilliantly entertaining,"Don't listen to all of these negative Nancies on here! I don't remember this series ever being billed as piece of historical record or claiming to be an adaptation of any work of Jane Austen. This is a beautifully and imaginatively written series that perhaps challenges the viewer to imagine how the issues of race and propriety may have actually played out in high society from the perspective of those who it affected rather than from the perspective of those who didn't want to admit it was a real issue.
Judging this series as the original work of art that it is, it is nothing less than brilliant. It is wonderfully romantic with indelible characters that are drawn together in a truly imaginative series that is addictive. I really hope they are able to continue the series!!!",10
Enjoyed!,"Pretty good representation of book series, so far. Dumb to cast a Gregory to be younger than Hyacinth! I hope there are more episodes soon. 🐝",9
Delightful,"Not trying to be an historical drama, a fun and delightful romp
Loved it
Ignore the bad reviews, not aiming to be anything historical",10
Gossip Girl meets Pride & Prejudice!!,"This show is so much fun! The shows story is so addictive, it really reminds me of gossip girl. The scandals and the salacious gossip are really entertaining and exciting. The music is just fantastic, I loved the string versions of some of this years chart toppers including Ariana Grande and Shawn Mendes. We all need something to brighten up this bleak year. This has everything you could possible want sex, scandal, love and beautiful people.",10
Happy and satisfied,Love the diversity cast in this series enjoy it 10/10 can't wait for season 2 in the future,10
Hardly difficult to see the actual draw.,"I gave it a go, watched the entirety of Season 1 & who are people kidding with the actual draw for this poor, one directional mess? There are actual dedicated sites that offer unsimulated acts for those unaware, for me this was a mess dressed up as a 50 shades ""story""",1
Binge worthy!,After watching the trailer I was curious about this show and didn't have anything to watch so I put on episode 1. Watched whole season within 24 hours!!! It has a lot of charm. Would say if you liked Gossip Girl and you also like Jane Austin stories you are going to absolutely love this!!,10
Absolutely fantastic,"I haven't seen Downtown Abbey and I""m not fan of Jane Austen... don't know why people constantly prefer to compare things?! This is love story for itselfs.
Good actors, amazing scenography... I really enjoyed it! Well done!",10
Great Drama,"Not usually one for period dramas but watched because of the hype.
Really enjoyed, it was funny, great story and fabulous acting by all.
Will get the books to read now.",10
A diamond for the cynic,"I feel like most of the negative review are by people who are used to Downtown Abbey or are looking for any reason to hate the series. I personally have never been able to get into historical, but this show captivated me. It's refreshing and does drag a little in the last few episodes, but at the same time it's refreshing to not have a ""and they lived happily ever after"" once there's a wedding and show actual hardships. The series does a good job to integrate other characters in a way that makes you giddy to see their romance play out in later seasons",10
Glittering Yet Comfortable,"Diversity, satire, humor, and wonderful costuming in this production focusing on a series of ""matches"" (many not of any interest, but none offensive or overdone.)The central appeal is the glitter of the videography and the chemistry of the two leads--both off the chart.Easy to rewatch or have on in the background, as well as a popcorn muncher for a weekend by the fire.",10
The script is the worse I have seen in years,"I am speechless. Season 2 is dreadful. The script is an insult to human intelligence, acting is poor. During some of the most ""passionate"" scenes we bursted into laughter. The situation was so unbelievably forced and comic we almost thought we were watching a parody.",1
Totally bingeable,"This show is off the charts good. Funny, romantic and gives you all the feels...",10
Liked Season 1 better,"Season 1 was much better than Season 2 in my opinion, it had more substance, romance, more thrill.In Season 1 you can truly get a sense of the strong connection between Daphne and Simon, of ""true love"", you notice the looks they give each other, their relationship is gradually built through small gestures and meaningful conversations and it doesn't take forever to reach its peak.Season 2 insists way too much on the negative sides between Anthony and Kate creating unnecessary drama, explores too much the ""family"" subject for Kate, and when they only share a few passionate interactions suddendly they're madly in love with each other. It lacks the build up and feeling of authenticity from the first season.Kate's stubbornness and devotion to her sister gets to the point that is truly annoying.Would've liked to have seen more positive interactions between her and Anthony and not so much time wasted with that farse of a wedding between him and Edwina.The whole thing with lady Whistledown also gets to be annoying, so much fuss around the subject. And it is weird that, just like Eloise, we rarely see the side of Penelope that likes to gossip and is interested in the affairs of others.Also, the complete absence of Simon in Season 2 was awkward.I truly loved how complex and full of substance Season 1 was. Season 2 was good, but dragging and unnecessarily dramatic.",8
I love this period piece,"I always wonder why a series or movie has either 1,2, or 3 ratings or 7, 8, 9, or 10 unless there is a group of people with some irrational bent for or against a show. This is fiction so people getting bent out of shape about color blind casting seems irrational.
There is a huge cast with many stories to tell of romance and intrigue. This actually is my favorite Shondaland show. I'm bingeing the first season and look forward to future seasons. The series has also encouraged me to buy the books by Julia Quinn.",9
Bridgerton is pure escapism : an Amazing and Modern adaptation of Julia Quinn Bestsellers (BOOKS).,"Bridgerton is pure escapism, fun, romantically erotic, Eye Candy.Take it for what it is and enjoy the talent of all those involved.1 - The first thing to note is that this series stems from the amazing success of Julia Quinn books, (lots of them) , so successful, in fact, that she wrote prequels and spinoffs . The books are funny,romantic, full of irony and steamy. Light entertainment with no claim to sofistication.2 - Bridgerton is NOT and DOESN'T want to be an a ACCURATE HISTORICAL period drama. The stories differ from the books a bit, and Shonda Rhimes unique take of them transports us in an ""alternative"" 1800, one where people of color had the chance to be included in the highest ranks of British Nobility (see Queen Charlotte).Bridgerton doesn't aim to be historically accurate or to mimick Jane Eyre: the only thing that is accurately described are the limitations and the difficulties of being a woman in 1800 society.Shonda Rhimes has done a magnificent job on every level, the visual, the music, the costumes, the cast... really, she is a tv Mastermind .She depicted a vaguely historical fantasy, rich in colours, romance, desire and used today musical hits, played by musical quartets in classical arrangement, as soundtrack. The use of color is stunning, and is complimentary to the storytelling, defining the characters and in both seasons the sory is aderhent enough to the books to not lose its heart.Clearly nobody is perfect and we're all entitled in personal favourites and tastes. I, for example, would have much preferred the character of Kate, in season 2, being as funny and ironic and lighthearted as she was in the original book. Both the script and the actress played Kate too headstrong and dry, cancelling the humour trait you can find in JQ book, making her a little too arrogant and at times completely unpleasant. (Not a fan of Simone Ashley acting, to be honest).I find Bridgerton a great entertainment show, with no pretense to the Oscars, but visually stunning and fun to watch.",8
Vastly fun!,"No it's not historically accurate, but we all knew that going into watching it. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy it for the super fun show it is!! I'm a European history major, and it didn't bother me at all, I found it refreshing, so not sure why people are miffed it's not true to history. It's an alternate reality which is why it's so creative and something NEW for a change.It's sexy, light hearted, and tons of fun so just enjoy the premise and indulge in the 'what ifs' of it all. Nothing wrong with a reimagined period drama series where people of colour could have been a Duke or a Queen, not the one shining the silver.",9
"cliche, appropriation of british culture, stupid and silly","This series is so silly... it follows the books so loosely that you wonder why it's named as such... the cast is terrible, the acting is mediocre, and the costumes are something worthy of a children's theater they added to the background of something historical and british, just to disguise the mediocrity that this series is.",1
Rich and famous portrait... again,A good portrait. More of the same. And this one is good. At the end of the day is a pre-Victorian gossip girl,8
Amazing !!,"It's absolutely wonderful it actually brings a delightful joy to many viewers, amazing cast, THE CONTINUATION OF THIS SHOW IS A MUST!!!! TOO MANY PEOPLE LOVE IT !!!",10
It's an excellent adaptation of the book.,"The plot, the locations, the characters and all the factors are rendered to perfection. The backgrounds of the characters, their experiences, etc. Are explained to the audience in a very nice and descriptive way. As someone who has read all of his books, I fell in love with the whole season and I can't wait for the other seasons to come out with the same perfection.",10
Really enjoy watching it!,I really love most of the changes they did from the what was on the book. Love the cast they did wonderful! They truly played their characters well! I had fun watching this series and do recommend to watch it!,10
Netflix always do well,"The Bridgertons is a series worth a second watch.I'm looking forward to the second season, it was very interesting to watch the plot as a whole. Despite the fact that almost every character has its own storyline.The very beginning may seem a little boring, but it's worth to endure, in order to continue to simply burn with interest in subsequent events!The series is filmed very beautifully, the cast is simply amazing. Smooth transitions, the atmosphere of the aristocracy and much more make the picture bright and interesting, but the main thing is just an amazing plot.",10
Terrible script and acting,"Billed as being a modern classic, this fails to hit the mark in every way. The two main foundations of any production are the script and the acting - both were appallingly bad (but not the good form of bad to make it at least laughable). The sets and the costumes were good to look at, especially some of the locations, but the acting was so bad it's as if the 'actors' (and I've seen better ones in a infant school play) had decided to vandalize every scene they were in to ruin the location. If you like watching total rubbish, poorly written and dreadfully acted this is for you. If not don't waste your time.",1
Best yet from Shonda,"All the haters made me have to write. This is not an historically accurate drama. It's not supposed to be. Nor were the black characters substituted because of color blind casting. They were purposefully added to create an alternate history, one where a king married a person of color and changed the culture. The fact that people don't get this is kind of inexcusable, since it's right in the dialogue of one episode. Yet, having different races is not a big part of the story - it is clearly a cultural statement. If you've watched other Rimes shows like Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder, you know that interracial couples are a common theme. Except this time, the main characters are flipped with a white female. I totally understand how that might make people unsettled with our American history of lynching black men for raping white women.This is not about the books - the stories are based on the books, and the sexual aspects are very much from the books. But, this version adds the aspects of race to make it edgier (and better). I haven't read the books, nor do I plan on reading them, because I think what has been done here is taking source material and doing something different with it. That source is based on a period when the romance novel was born, the era of Jane Austen. And, yes, this does pay homage to that genre very well. Especially since Austen clearly read original feminist material by Mary Wollstonecraft and used them for basis in her work, along with etiquette for women and the various ways they were expected to live and behave. And, there is considerable commentary here about those topics. But, regency novels are no Jane Austen, and shouldn't be equated as such.There are definitely references to Disney, such as the two simple sisters, one of them who sings terribly in one scene, like Drizella in Cinderella. This is also obviously paying homage, and perhaps satirizing the genre. But, it also feels familiar in a way that lets your guard down and pulls you into the story more. But, this isn't a rip off in any way, just as using the source material isn't, because art always imitates other art. The important aspects are in where they differ, and distinguishing those differences is where the statements are.Look. Nobody is saying that Bridgerton is a masterpiece like Pride & Prejudice. Much like her other shows, it's full of scandal and sex, but ultimately is fun. It's entertaining as hell. Truly, I could not stop watching this after a couple episodes, and I can't wait for more seasons. For people that don't understand that the casting is purposeful, I suggest you do more reading on American history and civil rights. It's clear to me that normalization of mixed society is a main theme, and I love it.Besides that, this is just cheap dirty fun. And, I liked that, too! :)",8
This is the best serial hit I've ever seen,"This is the best serial hit I've ever seen - pseudo-historical melodrama. The plot is very intriguing and unexpected. People are so tired of the debilitating madness in the world that the Bridgertons, with their uncomplicated, extremely banal and simple problems, wandering from century to century, turned out to be the perfect escapist start to the new. The public is also ready to enthusiastically follow the ups and downs of love, because romantic prose, with its elementary hyper-emotional sensuality, will never cease to excite people's minds. In general: this is a very cute, insanely exciting and colorful project, which even ends according to all the canons of a soap opera: here they get married, reconcile and forgive. I am inspired and advise everyone to watch 10/10.",10
Different. Austen meets fantasy.,Just watch and enjoy! A nice story with a fantastic decor.,10
It's up to u,"I started to watch this series once it revealed on netflix but I also rejected it once I finished only ep1. I thought it all rubbish and I'd never see it again. However, I found out it earned quite a bit of profit and attention from audiences then I think, perhaps, I should watch rest of the show. And the result I am not dissapointed at all. Probably you should give it another try if you made your conclusion about the show before you finish. But, no pressure, it's all your decision!",10
Chapeau,God bless you for the diversity of actors the music the costumes.I couldn't never imagine so much talent in one serie. Look them shine on the screen. What a wonderful idea to leave racism. God bless you for that. They are just marvelous.What a wonderful serie. I really enjoy it.Thank you all.,10
What is the world coming to,"I reluctently sat through 2 episodes of this series with my wife, bewildered at what i was watching. I'll be the first to admit i am not a romantic drama fan, but i don't mind watching a good show i can loose myself in along side my wife so i am open to them. However this one is off track in soo many ways. I don't watch TV to be reminded of political correctness or what some people wish history looked liked that is exactly why i avoid the news! now it's coming in through netflix. There may as well of been flying pigs and aliens included in this show as in my view it is history science fiction and a scary preset yet again to open doors that allow history to be confused and glossed over in a polical correct way. Be mindful of what you support.",1
10/10 All day everyday. Id just ignore any negative reviews.,"This show is unique and BRILLIANT & a MUST see !!!!
Your welcome :)",10
Bridgerton Fun,"Jeez people..what's up with all the bad reviews? If you read Romance novels, You would know that this was based on a collection of books by Julia Quinn. It's meant to be racy, it's meant to be fun, and Definitely not for the kids. So, quit complaining, watch the eight episodes, and enjoy!",8
"Funny, sexy, romantic and entertaining","A gorgeous-looking drama based on Julia Quinn's bestselling romance novels. This adaptation is fresh, exciting and a whole lot of fun. Think Austen and Gossip Girl, mixed with Downton, The Crown and perhaps a dash of Outlander. A splendid regency romp with a spectacular cast that are perfect as their characters. Sit back, relax and enjoy some good fun. Absolutely cannot wait for season 2.",10
Beautiful Fantasy about Love,"This TV Show goes very well with a beer or wine at the end of the day, and it actually helps to Forget about all Problems around us. You can Relax, and Enjoy watching pretty women and handsome men in lovely clothing, listening to their charming conversations in good English. Great Cast and talented script writers in First season. In my opinion, Second season is a bit lower in quality, but still moderately enjoyable to watch. Looking forward to Season 3!",9
Loved it!,Absolutely loved it! Binge watched until the end and I can't wait for seasons to come.,10
As a huge fan of Julia Quinn this was a bomb,"I couldn't even finish the 1st episode. If you're a fan of the regency historical romance genre, you may be as disappointed as I was. Maybe not, to each his own. For me it was a complete bomb. Didn't like any of the characters right out the gate. Maybe the problem is Ms. Quinn writes such fiere funny characters it's hard to accept what I perceive as bad casting choices. Maybe it would be very enjoyable to those not attached to the Bridgerton books.",1
Sexy romance wrapped in etiquette and manners!,"Great escape for any girl watching to dive into romance, a bit cheesy but the sexiest period drama I have seen, plus second season also funny. Story telling absolutely amazing! In nowadays lust and lost soul perversion it is nice to watch slow build up and poetic love dialogues. Super hot love scenes too, was a surprise gay can pull off such believable straight man. Second season better than first one. So let's see if quality continues in later seasons! But I will definitely come back to watch as it is truly great mix of passion, class, build up, fun, esthetics. Story teller voice was the things that kept me watching on first season, so well deserved award indeed!",10
Very Fun..Exiting and Diverse,"This show never claimed it was going to be historically accurate, in fact the entire point is to be diverse, fun and to add a new updated spin to this genre. Some of the people who are complaining are actually upset about the diversity. They're like oh no, what are black people doing on the screen? If diversity bothers you, watch something else. Apart from the low-key racist, there are actually others who are genuinely upset this is not some exact replica of the book, sorry to tell you it's not meant to be and if that's your expectation you may want to watch something else. The show changes some things and that's kind of the point. If you go into this with an open mind and a fun attitude, you're going to love it. The show does not take itself seriously which is actually what I appreciate about it. Its not really heavy, it's actually lightweight and very amusing. I love the spin on using current songs but putting a classic twist on them, that was so edgy and I appreciate things like that. The show takes liberties, it does things how it wants to not how it's supposed to. Its the good kind of cheesy and we loved every minute of it. The show is actually blowing up, a lot of people are really into it. I went into it understanding exactly what the show is trying to do, so I didn't take it seriously and I was able to have a really good time. Don't let the low key racist or the traditional people fool you. This is a really cool show and so many people have fun with it.",10
Oh Damn,"The Season 3 announcement of this show has been tickling my bum, not even going to lie. This show is great and the song adaptations are even greater. It feels so nice, fun, fresh and sometimes even oddly hot to hear songs from our century being adapted into the one they are in. I would make a painting about this show if I could, but I honestly don't want to. It's 107 degress outside today, and I can feel myself melting into my work chair as I type this. They give me nothing to do here, so I have lots of free time to write, especially very entertaining and easy pieces such as this one. Anyways, Lady Whistlewhatever needs to stop in her steps and remember that she is, in fact, a ginger, and she should feel lucky that she is not getting stoned every day because of it. I'm hoping she ends up with her one and only lover, crush, best friend, whatever you'd like to call it.",8
An Entertaining Series,"The series is fast-paced, witty, fun, sexy, and everything from the actors to the production are extremely pleasing. Episodes that have no boring parts that you just want to skip over like other series. A modern touch on Regency romance that viewers around the world can enjoy.",10
In love,"Bridgerton
I am presenting the series that i love the most , Bridgerton. I think it is the best series for people who like alternate history period drama . The story is about the Bridgerton family which is based in England . Daphne the beautiful daughter of Bridgerton deputs on London marrige market , while Simon the Duke of Hastings returns in town . And the most important one is Lady Whistledown , the mysterious lady of the newspaper which keeps everyone informed of the scandals of the society . That's what I like the most about this series , there's a lot of mystery and conspiracies that keeps you excited. This series is not exactly like every other British period drama about the fancy talk . But its also filled with romance,society-drama, rumour, mystery that grabs your attention since the begging . The acting is perfectly achieved and everything is well constructed . I fell in love at first sight. One of my favourite so far and I totally recommend it ! 10/10",10
Woke propaganda attempts to rewrite history,"History without any semblance of historical accuracy is propaganda, if you have not cancelled your Netflix account yet you should or this will never stop.",1
Sooooo gooooooodddd omg,"The whole drama is very wonderful and eye-catching, in addition to the background, costumes and music, the plot line of the story is also very bright, not dragging mud and water, and the passion play of the male and female protagonists is really enjoyable, after watching super reluctant, so I watched it a second time ;) Definitely the most memorable play I've seen so far.",10
Absolutely captivating from the very beginning. Perfect cast.,"Addicting,sexy,colorful,and filled with scandal and drama. I can't thing of a better way to close out 2020.
I really like the actors they choose.",10
Love the show,"I love the show, its innovative and interesting. My favorite so far, I could use a little less of the extra long love scenes, the story is good enough. I like the hot and steamy but I don't need to know every single detail. Im more of a classic romanticism, vs todays bang bang thank u mam. I like sensual sexy love scenes without crudeness otherwise it feels like porn. Beautiful
couplings.",10
Don't believe all of the bad ratings ! One of the better shows on Netflix.,"Can't believe all of the bad ratings on Netflix! This is one of the best shows on Netflix right now. It has scandal, romance and an intertwined story line. I like how they incorporated races together even though it wasn't the ""real"" regency period, after all this is fiction right? Since the COVID I have watched an I surmountable amount of tv and this is one of best shows. I only gave it one stars as I think the main characters ( Simon and Daphne) need a little more emotion in the acting and it is a bit pg rated for the story.",9
Absolutely necessary.,"The show is incredible.
We need to talk about it: black people was not rich in the history because of the white people. So, please.... stop and accept that this should be the right.",10
LOL netflix,"You know, it's actually somewhat entertaining watching these low-IQers who think they're actors, however it quickly becomes tiresome. The wokness and anti-european fake history displayed in this low-IQ series rewarded Netflix a cancelled subscription. Good luck Netflix :D",1
bi ass acting up rn,All those spice mMmMMmmmmmM honestly im fed up well thanks! Simon's your typical alpha male whose ego beyond the reach he can f himself ion care he can be gone s2's not for him.. but yall hear me ouuttt tho..,9
I hope for at least 4 more seasons,Enjoyed every episode and really hope for more seasons to come.,10
Sex killed the storyline,"It starts out as a fantastic and beautifully done period drama with amazing costumes, sets and hairstyles and then the sex starts. And it keeps going. And going. And going. It gets to a point that you just fast forward them to get to the next part of the storyline. It's a great up and down love story but the constant make-up sex is boring and loses its point. Otherwise a good production.",8
Beautiful!,This show is so entertaining. It takes you into a bright world. I am a huge Jane Austen fan and this was the perfect show to watch if you enjoy her writing.,10
Brilliant,"#BridgertonSeason2 was so good. I loved it and have watched it an unhealthy amount of times 🤣 #Kanthony have next level chemistry on and off the screen, its like 3D chemistry, it just jumps off the screen at you.I also loved all of the #anthonybridgerton monologues to #katesharma. I loved that it was so different to the first one in the sense that it wasn't only about displaying physical intimacy, it was also about highlighting psychological intimacy, the meeting of the minds throught the heart. Just loved it.I keep saying this season is far better because it's brilliant tv all round. All the elements. Watching Anthony's growth interwoven with Kate's and all those beautiful conversations with his mum, Daphne and Benedict and how that translates into all his monologues to Kate. Even things like the tulips he brings to her in episode 8 links to season 1 when his mum talks about tulips to him. It's all just brilliant.",10
"Brings new meaning to the word ""horrendous""","I don't think they've yet invented a word that can hope to capture the utter badness of this mess. I went with ""horrendous"", but that only hints at the level of awfulness achieved in this eyesore (and earsore). While I salute the reviewers who have attempted to document the various badnesses of this show, that's like trying to count the number of grains of sand on a beach.It will be a cold day in that famous hot place before I watch another Netflix original series...",1
Beat Romantic show,This was the best period Romantic show that I've ever seen. The Storyline was great.,10
Fifty shades meets gossip girl,"Amazing, romantic and can't wait for the next season",10
Guilty Pleasure,"So much hate on this show, but i must say I tastefully enjoyed it. Binged the entire season in one week and I for one look forward to the next! The fairytale romance had me hooked. I eagerly await more!",10
Love to watch,Really liked to watch this serie. Its like gossip girl in another period,10
okay,Hard to get into but had some interesting plots; kind of forced,8
Idiots' guide to Regency era,"So bad it's actually unintentionally funny in parts. A lightweight foam of nonsense, stripping any real substance from what could be a marvellous series to leave behind a bodice-ripping, suitably woke yarn for the moron generation. Perfect for bored housewives desperate for their next fix of 50 shades/twilight/etc. to ease the numbness. Anyone with any semblance of standards from their content should avoid.",1
Enganging all the way for romance fools,"I'll start saying that I don't considera myself a romance lover. However, I enjoy a good romance when it's well told and with extraordinary performances.Shonda Rhimes really knows how to do TV. In Season 1, they did a great job with world building (cause they addition of black Royals, rebuilds this world as is). In Season 2, they make it clear that the structure is a new story, new characters but the same quality. And Season 3, I feel like it cements the theme of it all which is a lot of romance, classy sex scene and gossip.It is very enjoyable, even if it's not usually your cup or tea. It's very entertaining, point blank.",8
Amazing show!,"When I watched this show I was amazed by how beautiful the cast and design of it was. The scenery was to die for and the outfits were also amazing. They also made sure to focus on each and every character showing how that character is going through something. Although the main focus is of the 2 love interest they do not fail at giving others screen time as well. People can hate on this show for having black people, and other people of color playing queens, dukes, etc. But, honestly does that really matter at the end of the day? This show was not meant for a complete historical accurate portrayal it was meant to show the love stories of the amazing Bridgerton family. From the moment I started the show I was hooked, every episode had me at the edge my seat waiting for something new. The shock when I found out who Lady Whistledown was the whole time was insane. This is a show a 100% recommend for others to watch.",10
Wow. Just wow.,"I really don't get the negative reviews on here. This show is absolutely spectacular! The cast, (I can't even choose a favourite as each is so unique and captivating), the acting, the dialogue, the clothes, the breath taking moments.... You get the point! 10/10!! Bingable delight!",10
Love this show,I live the storyline and how it keeps you wanting more.,10
"Bridgerton Is Love, Bridgerton Is Life","Like anything that's rarely done or having even a glint of controversy, there will be outspoken critics and reactionaries chomping at the bit to have anyone hear their pleas and protestations. It's not until they've become distracted by something else that a gem like Bridgerton can be genuinely regarded on its artistic merit overall. Despite the negative reviews here, I'm glad to see the general audience is far more discerning.Bridgerton is a delight, simply put. It's as easy as Sunday morning. I've found myself binging this series more often than I'm willing to admit. Okay, I'll admit it. I've watched through every episode at least 5x in under a month, and I hardly ever rewatch series. I'm not obsessed, you're obsessed! Anyway, it has beautiful sets, amazing production value, incredible music that I absolutely love, along with an amazing cast and characters; all tied wonderfully together by a beautiful script and directing. I could almost describe it like an 8 hour long movie given its pacing. There's always something interesting happening meant to drive this quite remarkable and unforgettable love story forward including truly gorgeous cinematography that brings this fresh reimagining of the Regency era to life. If you've an open mind, give Bridgerton a chance, and you will not be disappointed... unless having fun disappoints you. I can't wait for the next season to arrive!",10
VERY STUPID,This is more stupid than the stupidest stupid or even stupider.,1
I hardly ever review but this show (chef's kiss),"I am loving this new series already. I have laughed and cried over the course of the episodes so far aired. Seeing characters grow in their understanding of themselves and those around them is inspiring. Added to the amazing sets, wonderful dancing and beautiful arrangements of well know songs, it is just a pleasure to watch. One of the few shows that actually makes me put down my device so I can give it my full attention. I haven't read the source books and fully intend to wait until the show concludes so that I can fully enjoy it. Usually I would go off and read the books to get all the details that aren't able to make it into a tv series but this one I want to watch first so I can just enjoy the beauty of it.",9
What age does this series be about?,What age does this series be about? What age does this series be about?,10
Amazing!,The way they mock the old ways but still keep it informing and educative amazes me. Such a good and fun serie to watch!,10
"ONE OF THE BEST, SENT BUTTERFLIES TO MY TUMMY","I liked it a lot, I was first shocked that they put people of color as elite members of society but later on I kinda love the idea that (IF ONLY THAT IS REALLY THE CASE) then it would be a very lovely scene where love knows no race hope they put asians too even as traders. I liked how the story goes deeper when pride and hate is portrayed as something shallow and the duke gave in, that love weighs more than hate and how the couple came to understanding. As an asian from a conservative family, I can really relate with the scenes as to how my mom cared for me and how my dad used to arrange my future and how me and my siblings were as well as how the head maid of the house treated me and how I adjusted to the new community and the people of the household when I got married. I also loved the blind item like a classic gossip girl. It adds fuel to the fire and made the show more interesting. The show may have eliminated painful realities in history but the realities of life is there, how some couples are to each other, how many people portray a happy life but in reality they are not. How people appear rich, perfect and happy in social media but in reality they are problematic and empty. As well as how you would lose people and how they would talk about you once they find out your deepest darkest secret. The staring game is one of the best also, I like how they just look at each other and communicate. It is just so romantic!!!",10
Comparisons to Which Book?,I haven't read Bridgerton. I have read Bujold's Vorkosigan's Saga. We are all having a wonderful time matching characters from books written in the 1980s to 2010s with a book/screenplay airing now. Tee hee.,10
What's the point of this?,"This is an absolute mess. Nothing really happens, characters are plain, one-dimensional and not memorable.There is no message, no plot...I just do't see the point in making this series.The main character is only concerned to get married and have babies. She even makes a horrible thing to get pregnant later in the story and we are suppossed to like her and understand her?! There is literally nothing interesting about her.The male lead does not want any of the things she does, but it seems that it is romantic for the writers to coerce him into it. He also lacks personality.Horrible. I gave 2 only because the main actor is gorgeous.",2
Not your typical period drama,"""Bridgerton"" It looks like the usual period romance drama, but it breathes fresh life and more passion than is usually comfortable to watch with your parents. Along with the expected romance, there's a mystery that keeps you needing to keep watching. One season is not enough. Recommended for anyone that loves a good period drama but will enjoy modern elements.",9
It's not for everyone because....,...only the smart ones understand it. Brilliant work!,9
One of the best romantic story I have seen after looong time,"I loved everything about this series. Beautiful story, cast, picturisation, background songs, choreography, love and romance and most importantly how it ended. After long time I watched a story wiyh happy ending.
Ut is a must watch.",10
Must watch,This was a well put together series. The storyline was so so good and all the characters role was amazing. I just love the scandal in it was so good and this is something you can watch more than once.,9
Guilty pleasure - and not even ashamed of it. Much better than expected.,"Firstly you have to understand that Bridgerton is not historically accurate but a regency fantasy series.
Yes it has it's flaws and controversy but at it's core its an engaging, guilty-pleasure love story that has all the cliched tropes like Titanic or P.S. I love you.
It also has, in my opinion, the best shot sex scene on screen ever (wedding night).
It's traditional and sometimes prude but the dialogue is snappy and sometimes outright romantic. The music is both fun and melancholic when it needs to be. Have some fun for crying out loud.",8
What a joke,"This is unbelievably ridiculous of a historical tv show. If you want to call it historic, because it's completely wrong.It is completely inaccurate. The folks of African ancestry held high positions and had respect during this time? Let alone in England when they were not treated nicely?C'mon.When I see a show that takes place sometime in the past, i want to see accuracy. That includes fashion, hairstyles, mannerisms, music, etc etc. I don't want to see a tv series that would appease certain demographics.It is not worth my time. At least I gave it a try. Until they correct it, I will no longer watch.",1
Slaw and you were good and you didn't want it but it wasn't too much of a big difference between me too but it wasn't,I love the fact you have a new phone numbers and your number will help us get it out and you have a lot to choose to and your family will have a lot to choose to and you can share it to me and you can share your thoughts with you or you have to do something for your family or family and you have a lot to choose from you to and you are so blessed and your life will always have to do so we will always have a lot of things you can do to and your life will be so blessed and your family will be happy and blessed you are your life will always be happy with us all you do for your family love love and.,10
Throughly enjoyed it,"Nearly stopped watching after the first episode but stuck with it. So glad I did. Superb acting especially from the two main leads. The raunchy scenes between them were so tastefully done. Their chemistry sizzled. Colourful, lovely scenery including parts of Bath which I loved seeing as I live nearby. I'm really sad I've finished watching it.",8
Entertaining,"This is light and breezy, making it great entertainment after a long day.",9
Entertaining though unexpectedly raunchy,"From its wholesome-looking trailers, I had expected this to be like Downton Abbey or an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel. I almost dropped this when it got more raunchy than expected. But as I had done with Game of Thrones, I ignored the unpleasant parts so I could continue following the story.Overall, it's highly entertaining. Aside from the colorful and wholesome-looking cast, the costumes, houses, grounds and parks are lovely. The Bridgertons, with their capable and affectionate mother Violet (Ruth Gemmell), are a delightful lot. Composed of eight children with names starting from A to H, they really love their mother and each other, a testament to the great love between their parents before their father passed away.Violet's best friend Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh) is a rich and influential widow who is a friend of the eccentric Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel), the wife of King George III.The Bridgertons' neighbors, the Featheringtons, are quirky and rather silly, except for the youngest, sensible Penelope (Nicola Coughlan). A close friend of the rebellious feminist Eloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie), pudgy Penelope has a crush on Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton).The series showcases London society's obsession with finding suitable marriage partners during the Regency era. It depicts how fathers or guardians take their responsibility to find suitable husbands for their daughters or sisters seriously, the excitement and fuss that go with preparing for a ball especially during a girl's presentation to the queen, the importance of a girl's reputation, the long lines of suitors after a successful night at the ball, how being declared the diamond of the season by the queen can drastically improve a girl's marriage prospects, and a marriage proposal being the sought-after culmination of a London season.Every now and then, a mysterious writer named Lady Whistledown (voiced by Julie Andrews) would print scandal sheets that report on juicy tidbits about members of ""the ton"". Eloise, with Penelope's help, sets out to uncover her identity, even collaborating with Queen Charlotte one time.Season 1 mostly deals with the Bridgeton's first sister and fourth sibling Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor) who catches the eye of the Duke of Hastings, Simon Basset (Regé-Jean Page) during her first season.Season 2 is mostly about Viscount Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) and Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley).I found both seasons delightful once I've decided to ignore the raunchy parts instead of fuming over how the producers were sullying sweet love stories with unnecessarily dirty scenes.",8
I LOVE everything about it,"I created an IMDB-account for this review. Why? Because I can't get over Bridgerton!!! I'm jaelous of you if you haven't watched it yet. It is romantic, entertaining, the set and dresses are amazing and the storyline kept me captivated from start to finish.Especially the chemistry and intimacy between the two main characters Simon (too sexy, my goodness) & Daphne is so addictive. How they managed to bring across their emotions via eye contact, slight touches etc. made me start to believe in love again (yes, I'm aware that's not realistic, but still ;-)).In short: MUST watch, you won't be dissapointed.",10
"Soft-core, Regency Porn","I was not expecting much from this latest, Austen-inspired series, but it was almost impossible to watch. The whole plot was lost (and muddled to start with) in the frequent, Versailles-style sex scenes. It became clear very quickly that this was not even an outing to show faithful costume design, but rather, a bodice-ripper, erotic/romance novel put on screen. The terrible acting was irrelevant, since none of the characters or plot were worth paying attention to anyway.",2
People should open their eyes to new vision,"I watch the full series of Bridgeton and I would have to say that I found it very refreshing, it's something new something different they did not stick to old past use on how society should look or act. But using a little bit of a modern touch to a Renaissance Time. I found it fun interesting in risk-taking in a good way. A lot of people are still stuck in their old believes that when they see the high society they can't understand or believe that minorities could play these particular characters which is really sad especially with this time. I would love for my children to see stories that have more diverse backgrounds, to show them more than just slaves and servants but people of high society contributed to this world. So in conclusion I found that this was definitely refreshing and I cannot wait for season two",10
Go Away Trolls,I've been reading the books over and over since I was 20 years old - needless to say I was ecstatic about the show. It didn't disappoint- thank you for making it!!,10
Best historique romance ever!,"Everything was Perfect: the costume, the music, the storyline. The dances scenes are also fabulous. At last, the cast is diverse and so good! Why do we need to exclude good actors because it's not ""historically accurate""? Gosh, movies are fictions ! I am so mad that Hollywood chose white people playing leading roles in Asian-based stories. Is it proper? Think also of Elisabeth Taylor playing Cleopatra ( which is totally inaccurate, for sure...)
I do love the Bridgertons books by Julia Quinn and I love the changes made. The story of Marina, which is not in the book, echoes to the sad story of the wretched girl in Sense ans sensibility. But here, we do not hide the girl who loses her virtue, she is dignified. Siena, the opera singer is not the ever lost and miserable girl as we found in many historical romances, she is proud and choses her destiny. I do agree with the feminist view.
I personally love the duke, played by Regé Jean Page, his acting is really smart and subtle. I do hope he will be the next James Bond for he is able to show a new face of masculinity, with humour.
I also love Eloise, Violet Bridgerton and the Queen, they were brilliant!
I was not a great fan of Anthony and I'm afraid the season 2 will not be as good if he takes the lead... Anyway, I am looking forward watching it.
Thanks to Shondaland and Netflix for this great Christmas treat! I watch and rewatch the series with delight!",8
Fascinating! I am now dreaming of the XIX century,"It's a must watch!
Loved the characters, the storyline, the scenery.. great job! Super entertaining and worth to watch!",10
Candy,"What a delicious and addictive candy . Is it full of vitamins and nutriments ? no, but who cares ?I got exactly what I expected; a fun and addictive TV show with great actors and costumes . I love you Shonda.Obviously if you expect a realistic or historical drama, maybe that's not the show for you.",9
Absolute trash,"This is one of the worst shows I have ever forced myself to watch. Not surprised at all that it's a shondaland production as this wreaks of all the mistakes she has made in her previously entertaining shows. This entire series is mostly about the concept of knowingly marrying someone who doesn't want kids and forcing them into submission? Every relationship in this show is shallow and incredibly predictable. Even the ending ""surprise"" was not a surprise at all. I tried my best to get through this and find something enjoyable, but overall I can confidently say that I hate this show and it's absolutely awful. Please do yourself a favor and just read the books as it seems everyone who has read them can admit they are far better than this pile of trash.",1
"Great drama, but the forced diversity and sex scenes are a little annoying","I'd recommend trying this show out. I like the plot and think the acting is great.Heads up, they forcibly make minorities royal figures which is completely unrealistic for 19th century England. It is bearable, but it is in your face, especially when you first start watching it.There are way too many sex scenes that are literally pornographic. I wish they weren't so detailed.",8
Bridgerton - Beautiful costumes & scenery,"Not historically accurate, but the series opened up possibilities of how Regency life could've looked like in the past, should we have been more open to change & ethnic diversity. The colours & set was vibrant, the cast captivated the scenes; the story mesmerising & the one liners, funny as! Did not read the books, but binged Season 1 throughout Christmas 2020 & loved it. Can't wait for the second season coming in March 2022. NB: there is an exhorbitant amount of sex scenes that one can do without, otherwise it did not phase from the storyline.",9
Best historical romance 😍,"I loved it, the sets, the storyline, showcasing how much women have had to overcome and helps me appreciate how far we have come. That aside OMG amazing!",10
Miles better than the books and exactly what I wanted it to be,"This is a fantasy. There's no actual magic, but this isn't reality and it's not trying to be. It's an idealized alternate dimension where everything ends up alright and everyone who ends up together belongs together. There's very little substance here and I can see why that irks some people. I, for one, could not be more pleased. No other show has properly shown the inherent eroticism of the brushing of fingertips against skin, the temptation of a slowly removed glove, the breathless anticipation that most romance novels can only dream of capturing. I spent a full decade of my life voraciously reading Victorian romance novels trying to find something this good, and this is the crème de la crème of the genre.If you're upset about historical accuracy, I'd say that's like watching Game of Thrones and being upset that it doesn't accurately portray the middle ages. That's not the point and it's relationship with reality is not meant to be anything more than the gentle brushing of shoulders of strangers in a crowd. If you're upset about the racial representation, go back to the 1850s where you belong and let the rest of us enjoy ourselves.For those seeking more like this, don't bother with the books. At least not the first one, although I can't imagine the author discovers how to write less ridiculously shallow and sexist characters between books one and two.I will say that my major gripe is the instance of female to male sexual assault. It's saved (barely) by the character having no understanding of such things, but I completely understand anyone who decides to opt out of the show as a consequence. It's not right and the show doesn't do enough to portray the seriousness of such actions. She never really learns her lesson and we're left with yet another instance of media not portraying male victims as... well, victims. If it happens again on the show, it sets a pattern and I'll opt out of future seasons.",8
Loved season 1 hated season 2 didn't finish it,"I understand it's based on the Bridgestone family ,however omitting some of the characters from season 1 like Simon made season 2 uninteresting. Anthony and Kate don't have the fire to keep a whole season going. Probably won't bother with season 3.also they should've kept lady whistledown a secret longer.",8
I can't belive this show getting more then 1 star!,"Sorry but I could watch only for 10 min. The queen who behaves like a drank sailor in a pub. Where is the grace and benevolence? Really???
Editing my first review: after seeing a high score ratings, tried to whatch one more time, picked episode 3. No!! It is impossible. I have very sophisticated taste in movies and degree in art history.
This movie is nothing but a disappointment",1
its really good,"It is really good, i just hoped they would change the rape scene. i mean, there was no need for that scene and they made it look like daphne was a victim??????
other than that it truly is great",9
A classic show !!!,"Bridgerton is a lavish and engaging period drama that brings a refreshing twist to the genre with its diverse casting and modern sensibilities. The show's scandalous plot, gorgeous costumes, and captivating performances make it a must-watch for fans of historical fiction.Bridgerton, the Netflix original series set in Regency-era England, explores the importance of marriage and family in society. The show follows the lives of several families as they navigate the intricacies of courting and marriage in high society. Bridgerton highlights the social expectations placed upon individuals to marry well and secure their family's future. However, it also emphasizes the importance of choosing a partner for love and mutual respect. The show portrays the ups and downs of relationships and the impact they have on both the individuals and their families. Bridgerton is a captivating and beautifully crafted series that masterfully delves into the complexities of marriage and family.",9
Fantastic,"Diversity at its best . In a word Simon. The rest of the cast did their best to wow us but all fell short. That said, I look forward to season 2 that will allow other characters to shine. Bravo.",10
I like it,"I liked the fact that poc were represented.
And it was very interested although I don't understand some of the words but... Yeah",8
Breathtaking,"Bingewatched it, loved, rewatched it. The story is original, characters matched wonderfully. Will definitely watch all following seasons.",10
Waste of time,Jane Austen is spinning in her grave.. I'm waiting to see if Netflix makes a movie about Nelson Mandela with Matt Damon playing him. Really disappointed,1
Ignore the shade,"Ignore the idiots complaining about historical inaccuracies and color-blind casting. I don't want to write spoilers, so I'll just say that they clearly didn't watch episode 3. This is not a show for people who want serious historical drama. It's just good romantic fun.",8
"Full of Love, inspiring and Such a nice story.","Such a kinda beautiful story with lovely cast. And main is acting are really incredible.
I was literally completed in a one day. Such a fantastic series. And cinematography is perfect. Really I was thinking I was in past.",10
LOVE! new season is my least favorite.,"I absolutely love love love this show!! It is so easy to just turn on and sit down to watch. I loved the characters and build up they had throughout the first and second season. The first season was amazing and definitely my favorite! I also loved how they focused on one character in a season, I thought it showed variety and character development. After watching previous seasons I anticipated the new season very much but I was a little disappointed. This season didn't have as much build up as the other seasons did. I don't get the same feeling watching it as I did the previous seasons but still an amazing, fun show! I would totally recommend and is a much watch if you have Netflix!!!",9
Don't understand all the hate,"I seriously think people nowadays just need to find something to complain about it. This show isn't realistic, it's a show. It's a fantasy. In fact, it's a fantasy of rich aristocratic families, so of course we won't relate. But I loved it. For those saying it's shallow, pride & prejudice circles around the same themes. Sure this show is more lusty and the duke is fine as hell, but the problems are the same. Finding matches to marry. Aristocratic families who lived in the lap of luxury, had nothing better to do back then but try and find ways to entertain themselves so of course you can look at it as shallow, or you can loosen up and enjoy. I found it easy to get wrapped up in The main love story, they're believable together and have great chemistry. The loves scenes are enough to make a grown woman blush. For those saying it's not historically correct, some shows don't need to be. None of us had a problem with Brandy being Cinderella and the prince being the asian son of a white man and Whoopi Goldberg. Lighten up. All in all, I was sad to see this season end, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Looking for to the seasons to come.",9
Loooooooove it!!!!!!!,"Love this series!! Love the humour, love the drama n love the storyline. Cant wait for the 2nd book series 😍😍",10
Way too American!,"Supposedly set in London but clearly filmed in Bath. The dialogue is absolutely cringe-worthy and clearly written by Americans who think putting 'shall' in front of every verb makes the language Regency. Embarrassing! The acting is terrible, and this show has no historical accuracy whatsoever. Austen would turn over in her grave if she new this gaudy, brash, over-the-top trash is masquerading as Austen-esque.",1
"As a drama, it's a masterpiece!","The dramatic balance in Bridgerton is outstanding. There are plenty of historically accurate portrayals of this time period, but Bridgerton did not set out to be one of them. The writers paint a very romantic and artist take on the time period. The chemistry between characters can not be overstated and there were just enough twist to keep the audience guessing. I had no expectations when I begin watching it and for that I am thankful! It should be given an honest chance and enjoyed for it's unique approach familiar storyline.",10
Nanny McPhee meets Princess Diaries.,"I would recommend Season 1 definitely. It was charming and the characters made you fall in love with them. It is not an actual historic piece but a sweet story. I think my title of this review nails it. However Season 2 was difficult to finish in respect that there was zero chemistry between the leading love interests. If I can get through Season 2 and have a change of heart, I might revisit this review.",9
Just tried it to see what all the fuss was about,"I just tried this show because of all that I have seen written of it, I have not read the books, and I'm glad I haven't yet because sometimes the shows/movies never really do the books justice. But let me tell you that I now want to read the books, I love period piece shows and movies, and this show made me laugh and cry. I absolutely loved the spin on who the writer for the gossip paper was, it was a wonderful surprise, it broke my heart everytime Penelope got her heart broke and cried, it made me cry right along with her, and I thought it was perfect that she was the writer. And the love story between the duke and future duchess was lovely, I can't wait for season two and to get my hands on the booms",10
LOVED IT,LOVED every min. of this series. All of the actors were amazing. I fell in love with Simon. I love that it took me away from all of the hate and turmoil in this world for several hours.,10
Top favorite tv show,Yeap! The main actor is handsome! He steals the show!,10
Loved it!,"I´m on my 3rd run watching this show. I can't get enough of it.
Refreshing, dramatic, funny and romantic.
I recommend watching it and just ignore the bad reviews!! So glad I´ve seen this before I read the bad reviews to know they are wrong!",10
"Amazing ""period piece""","I love this show. I love the settings and the costumes. Everything is so extravagant and beautiful. I do think they increase the saturation on the images but it works everything is so beautiful. It makes me want to go back and live a high life in the endlish society. The story lines are great with different scenarios and never the same love story twice (yet). The newest season made me swoon. I can't wait for the second half to come out. The sex scene are very tasteful even though they are basically soft core porn, but what else would we women want. All the couples are sooo cute. I can't wait until Eloise meets someone.",9
Too much,"It is nothing new. Period drama meets saucy scenes, downtown Abbey at its worst.
Too much for me. For something that was promising too much ended really disappointing.",8
With the gardner eyes,"Probably the longest blooming wisteria, cherries and peaches on this planet... So lovely.",8
Can't stop rewatching it!,"Beautiful casts, gorgeous costumes and care to every detail in every scene! The yearning and slow burn are so delicious. Some parts were a bit slow but understandable because nature of the tv show.",10
Unintentionally Hilarious,"I would've given this tripe a 10/10 if it had been intended as a comedy. The plot lines are like the worst telenovela but without the acting. I have no problem with the historical inaccuracy, but the ridiculous writing, bordering on insulting, makes me laugh out loud. If you've ever seen the SNL skit, ""The Californians"" just imagine that taking place in early 19th century England. Everyone associated with this drivel should be ashamed of themselves however, if you look at it as a comedy, it is uproarious. Having done so, I feel slightly less cheated out of a couple hours of my life. Fabio should have been cast in the lead so that everyone would know this is an absolute joke. I would rather eat a toenail off a NYC subway floor than watch another episode.",1
A period drama with a twist,"This show has romance, drama and comedy and is definitely a nice twist to a period drama. It does not take itself too seriously and should be taken with a pinch of salt in places and enjoyed for the romp that it is.The casting is brilliant, there is great chemistry between all of the actors and the show does a good job with character development and arcs.It is set (loosely) in the Regency period, but really it is a world of its own. It centres on the Bridgerton family who are of British nobility, and follows other notable families and characters that come into contact with them. Each series is focused on a different Bridgerton and their quest to marry and ultimately find love. The first series follows Daphne, the eldest daughter. The second series follows Anthony, the eldest son and the head of the family.I have watched both series and enjoyed them both. My favourite was the second series. I really enjoyed the dynamics between Kate and Anthony and the Sharmas are a great addition to the show. That being said, both series are great.This is a show about family, love and friendship and how that is navigated in the world the characters live in. It looks at some serious themes, but it doesn't take itself too seriously and it is very well done. It has sex, drama, scandal and humour. It is a show to be watched and enjoyed!",10
"Double standards abound, but fun","The same self-appointed critics complaining about historical accuracy to the detail are probably the same people who believe today's news media is accurate at all. The same who champion it as being diverse, which is historically divisive in reality even if the current globalist push forces it down western cultures' throats and borders, would be the same screaming for ethnic authenticity in characters, time periods. But those are the ones that want to have cake and eat it too. Several reviews mention how the show whitewashes a tragic period in history, seeming not to realize that it's always done in entertainment, to all ethnicities. Follow the money if you want to know who's pushing certain agendas, but good luck getting the group that owns all the media to listen to you. Slavery is a touchy topic, surely, but this is not a story about slavery, and if you want accuracy, which the highly sensitive but historically-allergic mob seems to demand, better start with Africans who were the first, and remaining, owners of slaves. Is the truth too hard to show? Perhaps just unpalatable. But this is entertainment like the mass majority of the media. If you haven't realized that yet, turn off the TV altogether. Or at least do your mind and the world a favor and stop believing the divide-and-conquer ""news"" and consider yourself above the real plague of inaccuracies.Let's hope love conquers all.",8
🅱Season1: Need a 💓 fix? Problem sol☑ed 10🌟 °Sublime°,"If you feel you've been denied entry to places where couples can forge thru problems together, connecting by more than a (scorchin h🔥t) physical union, but also an intellectual, emotional, & spiritual level, then join me on a jauny to 🎶Shala-lala Shondaland!🎶Here's some 📰2 print: 🅱 S1 is as near perfect a 📺 💓 as one will ever 👀. Well adjusted girl meets mal-adjusted duke by chance. Gossip is vexing them, & he cannot tolerate the mam-'mahs after him to meet their dtrs. The 2 concoct a deal to act as if they're courting, so they'll be afforded peace. Yes, this plot has made prior appearances. That's only an issue for those who deem it so. Human behavior largely falls into templates, thus real life 💘stories are repetitive. It's copacetic for fiction, too, as the writing, characters, & the journey always make the story. If it's engaging, I'll have a ball w/ it. All else is a skyed backdrop.Daphne 🅱, senior 🅱sister, is the girl. Simon, the new Duke of Hastings, is said duke, & their 📖 is as sparkling as 💎s in 🍾. 🅱ridgerton is the family. M&D were a sufficiently strong 💘 match to ""prodigiously"" yield 8 children. It's been 10yrs since father has passed, @ 🅱's open. Oldest son, Anthony, is now Viscount 🅱ridgerton. As Daphne, in the spirit of most oldest sisters, is nearly perfect, the Queen bestows the title: 💎 of the Season, ❇The❇Incomparable❇, on Daph. This causes a 💣 of 👀 & gossip to 💥. While Daph&Duke negotiate the balls & promenades to which he'll escort her, the mysterious gossip queen, Lady Whistledown, is escorting them to distraction. LW is also distracting The Queen, who's developing a love-hate relationship w/ the scandal sheet. LW is daring, indeed. Having survived growing up w/ 4 bros (3 big/1 little) & 3 little sisters, Daph has a healthy sense of humor. Daph&Duke begin to laugh quite freely. She also impresses him, a boxer by hobby, w/ her right🎣hook. It's pure delight.A 💓📖 isn't worthy without conflict, no, Cherie? Well, here's one weensy road🚧: Simon's father, the 1st Duke, in caring only for his title, had been coldly cruel. Telling Simon as a child that he's a disappointment, the Duke sent him away to be raised by staff, promptly forgetting him. His mother had died in childbirth. Simon had no one. The Duchess of Danbury - grandest of 'em all & friend to his mother - found him & took over his care, becoming the only parent Simon had ever known. Hatred for his father had been the strongest🌊 emotion of his life. His dismal upbringing led him to decide to never marry or reproduce.You now know enough to be ""out"" in this society: Fill up your own 🕺 card from here;)🅱 takes place in London (w/ occasional gadding to the countryside) during the Regency Era, w/ George III as king: 1760-1820. He's the 👑 that lost Revolutionary War, which began 🇺🇸us. We'll now join the 🅱 fam in the 1st decades of the 19th century. Also around this time, Jane Austen, author of the greatest ♥📖 of all time, Pride & Prejudice, was alive & 〰🖋. Post Revolutionary War was not the wealthiest time in old England. After losing the colonies, they remained at war w/ 🇫🇷France, where the best silks, lace, etc, come from. War brought scarcity & the ladies of Regency high society, aka The Ton, wore 👗 w/ straighter lines requiring less fabric. The era of big💷 is during the reign of 👑 Victoria, Lottie & George's gr/dtr, when (2 flaunt💰)👗 were made of yards & bolts of fabric, bustles & petticoats (ala Scarlett O'Hara). Eloise doesn't know that she's got it easy!😅What makes 🅱 so special? For starters, crisp & snappy dialogue & crisp editing to create a pithy feel. It's fun lolling in the drawing room w/ the fam, listening to their jokes & jibes. The refreshing characters are fully formed. The actors. Oh my, the scrumptious 🎭 are Top-of-the Trees. This is a serious cast of thespians. Many are classically trained Shakespearean 🎭 of the highest capabilities, & some are breakout stars now (aka, the Duke, Regé-Jean Page. There's an 🎭 w/ a full dance card). The color 🎨 is revolutionary & glorious. 🅱 recounts history as it should've been, if mankind were of better stuff, rather than just imagining we are (thinking we've arrived is the true terminal, collective fantasy). 🅱 has the darkest skin tones, the palest ones, & every shade between. Finally, a show for everybody. Ms Rhimes & Co have actually created a new sub-genre in 🅱. Do you prefer ""authentic"", or fusion? There's a place for each. 🅱 is Era-fusion. They aren't making strict reproduction costumes. They start there & then have🎇fun w/ it. They just might 💃 to a string version of Wrecking Ball, or another pop song as 🎼🎶 by the orchestra. It's all magic. They get away w/ it, because their ♥ of the craft radiates warmth to the viewer. It's as much magic as 7M an Ep can buy. In fact, they ❇more❇ than got their 💵💲 worth: Given the obvious passion the production crew has for the series, the ❇parts became more than the whole. 🅱 is ⬆ranscenden⬆.Another departure from the much ♥'ed 📚 is the dazzling addition of THE Queen, Charlotte, or L😍ttie, as George calls her. All👑HAIL! The queen is magnificence in a wig. Golda Rosheuvel has 🎭 Lady MacBeth. Given her commanding presence, it makes sense. Every 🕚 she's on screen is⚡. The backstory is that the King fell in 💘 w/ her, which led to equal rights in society w/ regards to skin color.I daresay S1 has its viewer favs on top of Lottie & ❤throb, Mr. Page (Simon). Lady D, a role model of the highest order, commands every situation w/ class. Eloise, rightly, cannot tolerate the trivializing of women in early 19th century society. Mom may not see it this way, but Weezie loathes the idea of being traded off in marriage as if she's 🐄. (MOO! Says Benedict) Our smarty-pants Weezie would be labeled a scandalous bluestocking for having... thoughts. The levy for that is spinsterhood. The insult of the day was ""Ape-leader,"" from an old proverb that never-married women will lead 🐒 in hell. (🤔⁉❓➡😤) Egad, humans are cruel & manipulative in every era. Having an older sis like Daph only makes El more obstinate. Claudia Jessie is 🎊 as the very alive & intelligent Eloise. Penelope Featherington, 🎭 by Nicola Coughlan, is BFFS w/ El & youngest dtr of the Featheringtons. She also has a 📶⬆ IQ (she got it from MOM). That's why she & El get on so well. Pen has a lifelong 😍 on her friend & El's bro, 🅱#3, Colin. Ms Coughlan has quite a range & infuses the aptly named ""Pen"" w/ all of it. There's nary a weak spot among the 🎭. NOT forgotten is narrator Dame Julie🌼Poppin🌂 Andrews!🅱 is based on the 📚 by Julia Quinn & named for Viscount Bridgerton & wife, w/ their 8 bairns in tow. Ms Quinn was to write a trilogy, but ended up 〰🖋a novel for each of the 🅱offspring. It's a bejeweled example of how wonderful 💓 📽 can be. 📽 based on actual 💓📚hardly exists, being sneered at by those who fashion themselves intellectually superior to such frivolity. Can we call Shonda Rhimes a genius for recognizing this huge market? There is a genius in the ability to 👀 what everyone else won't. She clearly chose to go w/ her instincts, rather than play to our own high society of cheerless snobs in the entertainment 🌍. She🏆won. Like tea & scones, Ms Rhimes & Netflix make a wonderful pair. Netflix made 💰 💦, & Shonda assembled a worthy team who all ♥ the craft. 🅱 might be loaded w/ smiles, but don't doubt that the show's creative dept takes their 🎨🖌 seriously. It seems there's no end to the details one can discover upon each viewing. The art on the walls, the fit of the clothes, the colors & more, are not just eye 🍬, they're also messengers. It wouldn't be shocking if the Queen's wigs each have specific significance.Not every viewer is a 📽 geek, but even if one's waking cognition doesn't realize all the work that went into 🅱, even if one isn't aware of the caliber of the 🎭, the subconscious picks it up. The response to 🅱-S1 was 🌍 shaking b/c it earned that response. On top of it all, the show is FUN. It's mostly smiles w/ a couple 💉 of dopamine.Some directors have a multi-level vision of the visual medium. A 1.5 sec shot of Daphne, her back to the 🎥, casually standing & reading while her maid dresses her, reveals sores from her clothing that look like whip marks. The underbelly of the flippant adage: ""It hurts to be beautiful"" is portrayed w/ maximum economy. Anthony walks into the opera house where a singer is practicing: ""MiMi Mi MEEE!"" It fits.They haven't only affection for, but also honesty about this era. They utilize a light touch to highlight the heavy horrors of the day. Often that 🔨s the point better than hostile confrontation. An example is how young ladies are kept completely ignorant of how babies happen. When an unmarried woman shows up w/child, we see El & Pen decide they must find out how this occurred, so they can ensure it does NOT happen to them. No woman suffers more from this lack, than Daphne. While Mom 🅱 (divinely 🎭 by Ruth Gemmell) is darling, Daphne ""rings a fine peal over"" Mom (blasts her) one day for sending her out into the 🌍 completely ill equipped. They 🎯it by enhancing the flow instead of breaking it. The directing is so seamlessly smooth that it's easy to lose oneself in 🅱. Mission🎆Accomplished!Us 'h💘peless r💗mantics' know who we are. 🅱 is for us, but its appeal reaches a much wider circle of society, as it's just plain good 📺. As proof, I offer up my 29 y/o 🏉 player son. He 💘 Daph&Duke's 📖 so much he's watched it twice.

Interesting,Very interesting movie stuffed up in an serial. Good trailer. Interesting seconds actors. Disappointed continuing.,10
Why wasn't Outlander nominated!,"I am very disappointed, Outlander wasn't one of the nominees.",10
The 2nd worst thing to happen 2020,"Yes, it's beautifully shot. They incorporate contemporary music in a classical arrangement. But well-written? It is not. The plot is aimless, the character development is as thin as the dialogue. I don't care about any of the characters and even if we put aside that this is a poor knock-off of Gossip Girl in a Regency style, it's not done well and lacks all of the nuance, clever banter and explanation of manners of the era that make classics like Pride and Prejudice work even when redone as ""Clueless."" Bridgerton is to period drama/comedies what Grey Poupon is to fine dining.",1
Has potential for improvement,"To me it felt like they were trying to force a storyline but they themselves just didn't know how to execute it. Not just with Daphne but like even with Lady Whistledown. I cannot tell you how many times I forgot about Lady Whistledown until they mentioned her. With Daphne and the Duke everything happened SO quickly, there was hardly any tension, no jealousy or burning declarations of love, which is what you expect from these period pieces, because it's taboo to express your romantic feelings openly during that era, and when that happens it's like the most raw and intimate thing shared between two characters (the rain scene in Pride and Prejudice),but they just couldn't execute it well enough.I love the Duke (Regé Jean-Page), I think he's very hot and it's about time we had a man of colour portray the handsome royal in these shows, but even with his storyline they could've done so much. With his childhood trauma, his daddy issues- I feel like he should've had, in fact he deserved to go on that hero's journey and finding out that he's not this emotionally detached fu*kboy that he thinks he is. I feel like we were robbed of his emotional development and seeing his feelings for Daphne develop as he finally accepted himself as the man he is when he's with Daphne.I feel like he should've left the country, so that there was something he and Daphne both yearned for, some burning desire that was emotional and not just physical. And then when he came back (in the next season, preferably)they could reunite and have that burning love, that indistinguishable fiery passion, because they realised what they mean to each other.That being said, I did enjoy it, I think it's light entertainment- fun to watch. A bit slow at times and some storylines can easily be removed. But the clothes, Jewellery, the set design is remarkable. So just don't expect a lot from the first season and you'll be a happy viewer. Let's see what happens in the 2nd season...",8
The nice little soap opera,"This is definitely a nice little soap which someone can binge watch in one lazy weekend.I felt 1 at season was better than the next one basis of wit, sarcasm, feminism and last but not the least role of lady whistletown.Lady W was lost somewhere in the 2nd season. The love story suddenly became the only thing going on. A bit cliché but entertaining nonetheless.",8
Roaming Reckless sent me here,"I would never have given this show a glance had it not been so highly recommended by youtuber Roaming Reckless. Now I'm hooked and can't wait to see how the rest of the episodes unfold. Love all the characters and enjoy watching their individual story take shape.If I had to pick a favorite or two, it would be Penelope and The Duke of Hastings. Those two characters are deep and so very human in the damage done to them and how they hide their scars and do their best to put one foot forward and find balance in their lives. The scenery is rich and beautiful and the dialog is clever and witty. There are life lessons to be learned along the way if we are open to hear and see them.",8
ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!,"Bad writing, bad acting, bad costuming ... bad everything. And while it is currently politically correct to ignore ethnicity when casting for movies, doing so backfires entirely when it so egregiously contradicts historical fact and reality. Avoid this bit of Hollywood fantasy.",1
Another Woke disaster-piece.,A historical fiction relying HEAVILY on the fiction.,1
Not worth the time,"I've seen The Tudors and loved everything about it, I've seen Versailles and it was absolutely fantastic. Now, 'this' show here is utterly bad, disgusting and shows horrible actors, too! I can't believe how anyone in the world would want to continue watching this BS after Episode 1. Absolutely the biggest nightmare of TV shows in history ever!",1
SO. IT'S COME TO THIS?,"My wife has had to sit through some pretty dire TV series' of mine, with little complaint. But NEVER anything as truly, shockingly awful as this pile of steaming excrement, that I endured at her request.
Netflix have made fools of themselves, and their subscribers, by putting this innacurate, woke, embarrassing and unintentionally hilarious mess of an adaptation on.
I've never shook my head as much, watching TV. I'd have given it zero stars, but the 1 goes to my wife, for not losing her s**t with me for my persistent carping about this utter garbage.",1
Should be labeled as fantasy,"I can't wait for Netflix to make roots with a white and Asian family that experience the horrors of racism.Aristocrats all over the world mix races all the time.Not every series that is made needs to contain a group of friends that has every race, every gender as that doesn't match reality.This is the type of show guys get forced to watch to appease their other half, but have to cringe through all the crap that is clearly not the way the world was in that region during that time period.",1
Overrated,Disagree with positive reviews. Do not get taken in by report that many are watching. Nothing in this matches Masterpice period dramas. Except for the male lead Lorrd Hastings the cast is uninteresting overall and the story is poor. I made it through five episodes (now regret) and will not return for more. I admire Shonda Rhimes; I like the cast diversity. But the story does not hold. I cannot understand making the female lead an object of attraction; she just is not;poor casting. Very trite. I was not going to watch but did because of an enthusiastic critic. Wasted 5 hours-will not return. And who cares about trite brother Anthony whose story is the second season - he is a jerk.,1
Parody at best,"The sets are spectacular, the costumes wonderful, the acting very decent and there it ends. The story is contrived, the use of a United Nations cast is a huge distraction, and the script get annoying at timesWorth a watch, yes - but don't expect the grip of Downtown Abbey.",3
Trill and overacted,"In my book not everything needs to be Shonda-ized. I found the plot and acting forced and modernizing both the costumes and music felt out of place. At least the book allows you to imagine you're reading Jane Austen (even though it's just Gossip Girl fan fiction), whereas the series just makes you wish you were watching something else. Disappointing.",2
Inane? Insipid?,"I have tried 3 episodes... cannot do it...I have thoroughly enjoyed Period pieces in the past.. whether drama, romance or just plain fun... this is so silly ( and not in a good way) and flat. What is there to enjoy?",3
What happened?,"I adored season one. Season 2 was such a let down. The writing is bad, and the two lead females are horrible actresses. There is literally no chemistry between ""Kate"" and the Viscount. The scenes seem awkward and forced. They have about two hostile conversations with each other and miraculously the Viscount is madly in love, and she is all he can think about. Totally unbelievable and a complete let down after the beautifully written first season.",2
"Season 1: Hot, Steamy, Thrilling / Season 2: Lackluster, Boring","The first season of Bridgerton created quite a stir when it was released, leaving passionate viewers impatiently waiting for a season 2. I loved the passion between the Duke and Daphne and the whole storyline was charming, seductive, and no disappointment. The Duke of Hasting's absence in the second season is a huge void unable to be filled by the eldest son of the Bridgerton family. Although he was introduced in the first season having sex on a tree, the second season waits painstakingly long for Anthony and Kate to do the dirty deed. It was excruciatingly tiresome throughout the hour long eight episodes to ultimately be a lackluster and extremely modest storyline. Part of the craze of Bridgerton were the steamy sex scenes but in the second season, it felt inauthentic and a strange montage rather than passion, desire, and that authenticity for their first time.However, some shows do entice viewers by adding shock value with lots of steamy scenes for the first season and then tame the beast from season 2 on. Hopefully, the views and reviews of season 2 will let the show creators know the sweet spot to get back to the greatness of the first season when they start production on season 3 and 4. Unfortunately, they may have lost a lot of viewers... myself included with the tragedy of the second season.Season 1: 10 stars
Season 2: 2 stars.",2
If cringe acting is your thing,The acting style is painful to watch. Costume and set choices are tacky. I cringed through the first episode hoping it would get better. It didn't. If you are looking for an imaginative/funny period piece watch The Great instead.,1
"Overrated, Cliched and Pretentious!!","This series could have been a 2-hour long movie. All the episodes seem to be a repititive and same plot of people attending some fancy party organised by one of the rich society member.The over-the-top high society act of the bygone ages fails to keep the audience on the hook for more than 2-3 episodes.Why do they have to show such fairytale story kind of series which shows nothing more than cliched and pretentious society. Does not have any thrill, and so much predictive storyline with you already predicting who would pair with whom. Eventually!!Though it gets interesting somewhere inbetween but overall just a repititive match-making fairytale story with just the candidates changing.",4
more cliché and predictable than ever! Yay...,"""Dearest Readers"",Bridgerton, a ""mixture of Pride&Prejudice and Gossip Girl"" (not my words) is back! And let me tell you: Bridgerton and Pride&Prejudice have still as much in common as Gilmore Girls and Ginny&Georgia (another dreadful Netflix series I do NOT recommend to watch): Exactly, nothing.So predictable, one couldn't even classify it as ""guilty pleasure"" anymore, so tedious was it. The unnecessary (!) and excessive sex scenes were, thank God, missing this time, and instead we got numerous scenes of the love interests loudly and exaggeratedly breathing at each other.The majority of the characters feel very two dimensional and stereotypical, even more than last season, though they try to explain their actions by adding traumatic backstories; I have NEVER seen those sort of characters before! *sarcasm over*
Bridgerton has again chosen the enemies-to-lovers trope, like in last season. One could blame the novel for this ""idea"", however it feels lazily executed by our no 1 medical drama queen Shonda Rhimes.I could write a whole essay about all the things I got so fed up about while watching this series, but instead I'll save you some time and simply tell you to watch a real pride and prejudice adaption instead.Yours truly, Lady Wash-it-Down.",1
Season 2 is a disaster,It is a waste of time to watch season 2. The main characters this season made it look like a child play. No real acting. Lots of looking only.First season was good and it makes you wanna know what happens next. I fast forwarded a lot season 2 because it is boring and awkward.,1
"Bad, first one was ok but second season horrible.","Bypassing the historical inaccuracies of season one, season one had more of an enjoyable feel to watch. But this season seems to be glorifying narcissism and other abusive relationships.. Further more there seems to be a disconnect between the main friendship, she's more of a stalker then a friend. It's just horrible.",1
"I tried, and I can't...","I tried so hard to ""get into"" this series. Normally, if the first 2 episodes don't catch my attention, I turn it off! I gave this one wayyyy too many chance. After watching each agonizing episode, I thought, ""there HAS to be something really good in the next episode"" from all of this ""hype"" I'm hearing! Nope, nothing ever happened! It's horrible. Like teen Disney Channel acting horrible! Don't waist your time! If you're looking for a GREAT romance series, 'Masters of Sex' is phenomenal!",1
Ridiculous,"According to most, current and pressing issue with this show is diversity however the true fault in this show is it's acting and plot - the fundamentals of creating a good show. The plot is, to put it simply, incoherent and ridiculously produced. I could not work out whether or not the show was a parody! In addition, the acting is shocking and a true insult to modern theatre. I was terribly disappointed. Usually I like to be introduced to new actors and shows, but this offensive portrayal of aristocrats and the below-average representation of film actors left me with nothing but second-hand embarrassment and disgust.",1
"How long, Oh Lord, How Long.",...must we be asked to accept these period pieces with contemporary diversity? An insult to intelligence.,1
What a travesty show!,"0/10 you won't even get one star, woke comrades. This is a complete travesty. Did you even go to school or you just live in some weird pathetic dreamworld? Do not waste your time and money on this .... (not allowed to write it down).",1
Terrible,"Of course, another film where we apparently need to rewrite history because some people can't handle truth and facts. There are way too many sensitive people in this world these days.",1
Fake and boring,"Re-imagining history is a tricky endeavor even in expert hands, but this is awful. There's no rhyme or reason to it.",1
"""Woke"" casting",A Black Duke and a white Aristocratic lady in Regency era ? On top of the terrible D rated acting and totally PC woke casting? Give me a break! Totally ruined my beloved memories of reading these books. There is nothing that can suspend my imagination to see all these black actors playing period roles that are so unrealistic.,1
Awful,If you like telenovelas maybe this is for you. No depth at all.,1
"Woke Fantasy ""Period"" Drama - Embarrassing",This series is so slathered in PC woke-ness it entirely misses its mission to entertain. Insulting and pathetic - avoid at all cost - watching even one episode will lower your IQ by 50 points.,1

Should have ended after season 1,"Season 1 had its flaws but was light and enjoyable. A 7Season 2 was utter rubbish, non sense not one story line credible and most characters unlikable. A 1 as I can't rate a zero.",3
Lacking character depth and very jumpy,"Generally poorly acted and with superficial character development. Too fast paced between scenes, jumps around.",1
Incredibly Boring,Bizarre highschool dramedy period piece. Bad casting and acting.,2
Endlessly boring,"This show has literally nothing to offer, it was a huge disappointment",1
Horrible Writing and Casting,"As someone who loves period dramas (Downton Abbey is my favorite show ever) I was so excited about this show. Unfortunately, I do not understand the high praise it's getting. The costume design is great and some of the scenery is good, but a lot of it looks like CGI. I love all the diversity, but I actually think there should be more representation. I'm surprised that the two main families are made up of completely white actors. My biggest complaint is the writing and casting of Simon and Daphne. The show presents 0 stakes (poor girl she has to choose between two rich handsome men) and Daphne's character is so boring. The actors who play Simon and Daphne are fine on their own, but they have 0 chemistry together. I'm so happy for everyone who does think they have chemistry; I wish I could see it. Maybe there's something wrong with me, but I find their interactions so cringy and forced. I'm mainly watching the rest of the season for Penelope and Eloise, as I find them to be the most interesting. However, I don't think I'd watch a second season and that's sad.",3
Another rubbish Netflix series,"Good Netflix shows are very rare these days. Watched the first episode of Bridgerton and that was enough. Another stupid series that makes no sense with Netflix trying to show how woke they are. Skip it, and do what our family is doing now, watching Friends reruns and other 90's shows for some decent television.",1
Utter disappointment,"Period dramas are my favorite type of show-movie-film-book-etc. Bridgerton turned out to by only a display of luxurious costumes and house settings - one of those cheap stories with no spice. I tried 3 times to go past the 3rd episode and succeeded only the 4th time. It gets a bit better in the second half, when I thought there was finally something to happen.
I accepted the the shock of ""wokeness"" - black aristocracy and queen, contemporary music and in balls - rand hoped it could be fun and diverse. It wasnt. A good story, good dialogues, good acting could have made an interesting approach for the inclusiveness/diversity concept. They didnt exist.",3
Someone spent a lot of money to create an USofA 'Game of Thrones' fantasy - don't waste your time,"I have not read the book. It's a fantasy novel, OK. I have no problem with the cast diversity - it's the sole redeeming feature. I just can't understand why anyone would make such crap. Why engage such a talented crew to produce rubbish like this?",1
WOKE,"Not real, I will watch Downton Abbey for the fourth time instead of this mess.",2
Limberger,This program has so much cheese they should have called it Wisconsin.,1
Very poor,"First of all, if someone would make a movie or TV series about the ancient Ghana kingdom, it would be nonsense to cast white people as the main characters. Why does it not work in reverse? It is stupid and fake to do as Bridgerton does. The past is the past, acknowledge and accept it.Then, about the rest, in my honest opinion the plot is incredibly predictable, poorly written, and the acting is not convincing (especially Dafne's one, I found her quite obnoxious at times).",2
Ruined a great set of characters,The charm of Julia Quinn's Bridgerton novels is in the truly likeable and engaging characters. The tv shows has made them bland and obnoxious. Unlike some reviewers the diverse casting doesn't bother me. The terrible adaptation of some of my favourite novels does. God awful. I can't get past the first episode it's just a travesty.,1
Waist of time,It's the worst 19th century tv show. The show have nothing to do with how they talk and live in that century. I have read and watched a lot books and moves and tv show about that century and they have nothing do to with Bridgerton. It's a waist of time. I watch a the episodes only because I want to have a complete opinion and to find out what happen in the end.,1
Boring and dreadful,Like watching paint dry but even worse. My wife decided to given it a try and I spent most of the te staring at my phone waiting for it to be over........,1
"Watched the whole thing, because I'm sooo bored with COVID","I cannot believe that this has so many 10 star reviews! It's one of those shows you try because you've watched everything else on the top 10 list (except Cocomelon *shudders*). The girlfriend hits play, and we watched 3 episodes that night, hoping it would get better. Finished it off the next couple days and had to figure out why it got good reviews.I literally made this account in case it saves someone the ~8 hours of this show. Pick something else.",1
Belongs on the cutting floor,"Absolute garbage, I thought it was a American parody or was it ? The actors are one dimensional very predictable , if you want to throw 8 hours away, fill your boots. For the life of me I can not understand how it has a score of over 7. Generally I will give anything with a score of over 7 a shot but this was just bad bad bad. Don't even get me started over the diversity issue but if in fact it wasn't a parody then at least try to make it too have some semblance on being historically correct instead of making it politically correct. If I could give it zero I certainly would have done utter trash",1
A masquerade!,"I've just finished Borgia, The Showtime production and it was so satisfying to watch, yeah they took a lot of liberties, it wasn't accurate but still you could immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the time. I'm watching rn Shogun not historically correct but following a legend character which opened the eyes of the viewers to a special time in the Japan history, a window to a culture with such authentic soul.And then Bridgerton, oh God, it's a preposterous representation of an European culture viewed through the eyes of Americans. As all too americanized productions Bridgerton could be very well categorized as a total circus! Flashy but with no trace of authentic feeling, an impotent understanding of Europeans. Just sick of it!",1
Cheap Austen Ripoff,"Pedestrian. Predictable. Pandering. Plodding.Good costumes and good sets.Just film an actual Austen novel, again.For all the brouhaha...just a basic take with tropes.",2
Embarrassing,"Yes embarrassing what a way to ruin a book, ruin history. It upsets to think that Julia Quinn who wrote the source material that was so well researched in all areas sold her rights to made into this drivel. I hate to say Julia Quinn. Who was my go to re-read will never be re-read again. I am so sad the someone should sell her vision to be made into this embarrassing Tosh. I admired writers who hold on to their dreams, Rowling, Meyer and even EL James.
Just so so embarrassing!!!!!!!!",1
I do not like it,It's awful. I felt no emotional connection to the characters. Netflix adaptations are soo bad,1
Aweful,"Those telling you this is ok are the ones crying all day about cultural appropriation. Bunch of hypocrites.The series is empty and fake as much as the cult that made it.It is an insult to Jane Austen, an insult to British culture, history and cinema.Another example of ideological fanatics pretending to be artists while all they want is to push their propaganda via every medias they can get their hands on.These guys would make soap that doesn't wash just to push their propaganda on the box.Same thing here, this movie has no other purpose then to put diversity where it doesn't belong.Life is too short to be subjected to such bad material.",1
"Great costume, complete trash otherwise","This show is not only wildly inaccurate in its period depictions but also incredibly pretentious, distastefully raunchy and just all around trash entertainment.",2
Incredibly inaccurate,"I just decided to watch it for Julie Andrews being in it... but the historical inaccuracy (I'd rather that it didn't explain the existence of the colored characters and just made it a normal thing... though that wouldn't make much sense either...) but if you came for Julie Andrews, don't bother watching this, just go watch Mary Poppins or The Sound of Music again😆",1
Hate it!,"Didnt like the love story. Was so predictable from the moment they met it was known she was going to act like she didnt care for Anthony but forced him on Edwina. I saw Edwina more pure n noble to be w Anthony than Kate but lust won more than love, ""love"" came after hurting her sister. But again fairytale story that was not what I expected. Edwina was even prettier. The only thing worth watching the series was the secret story line of Penelope. Other than that thumbs down! 👎🏼 I get Anthony was feeling obligated to marry n choose Edwina, he needed to feel love. Its just courting one sister n marrying the other thats a messed up 💩. Only in that fake world of appearances. Also I get its a book. It happened. Still can say dont like it. Sorry not sorry my OWN OPINION N VENT! #Respect.",1
"I've never posted a review, but this deserves to be bashed.","1 is more than deserving. Couldn't go through the first episode. I don't care if it's fiction, it's too inaccurate. Acting is mediocre and bad. Costumes are overstated and just too much. The storyline is weak, cringey. I've read a review stating that the soundtrack includes Ariana Grande? Why? How? The whole thing felt like a school play with a bunch of kids dressed up running around without making any sense. I am judging those who rated it positively, an insult to cinema.",1
BOOOOOOOOORING,"This started out boring, then got more boring as it droned on. I continued to watch it for the benefit of my wife. She loved it. As probably all women do.My idea of Hell?: watching this for eternity.",1
"Good lord, Netflix can really put out some of the biggest tv trash in existence","Complete and utter trash. There's nothing good to be said about this, except that I'm glad there's a stop button.",1
Pretty bad show,"Both me and my wife think this is one of the worst costume drama ever. It's completely meaningless, stupid and overly dramatic. It feels like a cheap pocket novel from 1980 for girls.
I can't understand why it got so much publicity in the media.
If u want the opposite, watch a serie like Mr.Selfridges instead. That's the best costume drama ever!",3
Awful,"Awful Acting, shamefull cast and a cheesy Story. Besides the few plottwists there is nothing exciting about the Story",1
Where are the pumkins?,"No glass slipper, no Fairy Godmother, no besotted prince scouring the towns and villages in search of his one true love. No heroin, the black-sheep fated to be an indentured slave to her social climbing petty, petty bourgeoisie step family.....who ends up being Queen of Snowdovier...a mid-sized fiefdom in Prussia.In this period piece depicting the pageantry of Imperial Britain at its height of power, the story centers on the romantic travails betwixt two members of the Aristocracy. As well as having to contend with the social prejudices of the era, they also have to contend with the unspeakable horrors of obscene wealth, servants tending to their every whim, and being considered the quintessential example of ascetic western beauty. It's just tragic, some people just can't a break!At the conclusion of the I am repelled by you, now I think I might like you, now I really hate you bit, when they finally realise what we have known all along, that it's heightened sexual tension and they desperately want to shag one another. And so as the shagadelic heat meter is flashing red hot, Simon suddenly pulls out at the last second without explanation, that leaves Daphne confused, perplexed, and one would suspect having to resort to manual sexual relief on more than one occasion, as battery operated joysticks had yet to be invented.We had already been made privy as to the bulwark that was preventing the union of their hearts and bodily parts, as Simon had sworn an oath to spite a dying father whom he despised, informing him that he would not marry and have children, and so the family line would die with him. This continuation of the family line was of paramount importance to his Aristocratic father. In other words, Daphne had not yet realised that Simon was a bewilderingly infantile, spiteful, moron and that she should ran for the hillsSimon takes an oath to spite a dying father, who dies less than a minute later, and who is therefore unlikely to continue to stew over the end of the family line. For the negligible angst he may have caused his now deceased father, Simon, being a man of honour, irreproachable, a man of his word is going to spite himself and turn away the women of his dreams should she one day knock upon his door, in order to keep an oath made to spite a dead man he despised, witnesses by no one.In context of the series, there is no reason that Simon cannot just reveal his reasons, instead of leaving others at a loss to understand his contradictory behavior, other than to depict him as the stoic martyr bearing the cross he must carry in silence, without complaint. In the real world he would remain silent because he would justly fear being criticized as an infantile imbecile.It would not matter when this, whatever it is, was set. It's idiotic in any period. However to have coloured people portrayed as accepted equals, including the Queen no less, is just bewildering, at a moment in history, when Western Powers had just drawn up the borders of Africa that they were invading, slaughtering and enslaving millions and pilfering resources that has never ceased. The west drew up the borders, (at the Berlin conference 1910) in order to prevent hostilities breaking out between the imperialist despots..",3
Terrible,"Terrible. adaptation without respect to the book, to the historical facts and that tries to adapt to the politically correct of the current society.",1
Didn't make it that far but...,"This is like an attempt to have an old-fashioned setting but with a modern touch to it and it doesn't work at all. Feels like a theatre rehearsal and none of it rings true. No real emotion or depth, just misappropriated costume drama. Doesn't at all capture whatever these shows are supposed to capture (Downton Abbey did it far better).There are so many things wrong with this but if I go into details my review will probably get blocked. I only recently noticed most of my reviews have been rejected and so I suppose there are a lot of words you can't use (including words I would not consider at all offensive).",3
Season 2 is a Dismal Disappointment,"While I appreciate the fact that the sex scenes in Season 2 were fewer, and far less pornographic, the two main characters are completely unlikeable and have ZERO chemistry. After three episodes, the ""I hate you/I love you/I hate you/I love you"" sceneries became quite tedious. This season could have been wrapped up in a 1.5 hour movie. I ended up playing word puzzles on my phone during the last few episodes because I really didn't care what happened to these two insufferable characters. The only bright light in this disaster was the character, Edwina.",2

Season 2 review,"Season 1 was very good 8 out of 10. Season 2 I can't even bring myself to finish it - boring, boring, boring.... The writers have failed to come up with anything original for season 3 and are basically trying to repeat season 1 but without the excitement.",4
God save the queen? More like the queen saved season 2,"Season 1: deserves a 7/10 rating. Now season 2 more like 3/10. The horse racing was probably the best part of this show because no one was talking. A very predictable premise indeed. The two future lovers hate each other then eventually get together, blah...blah...blah. For this season I didn't even care if they got together. There was no chemistry between the viscount and Kate. Their dance and their intimate moments were robotic. Kate is stuck up and stiff and cannot act. Frankly she was just annoying. The fact that her sister forgave her so easily was annoying as well. The featheringtons were even more annoying in the second season and I didn't think that was possible. I can honestly say that my favorite characters were Lady Danbury and The Queen...they kept me entertained at least.",5
Why didn't the Hallmark Network present the Book?,At least we would have gotten more of the actual story as written. I can't believe Julia Quinn agreed to this unrecognizable adaptation to a truly enjoyable story. This trashy novella was not worth putting on film.,1
Dear God make it stop,"This show is so bland it should be in black and white. The characters have no...well character. They are dull and lifeless. I don't understand how the producers looked at the final cut of the first episode and thought ""yes this is a winner"".",1
Nothing like the characters in the book,"I would probably give this series a higher rating if I had not read the book. Daphne and family bears little resemblance to the characters that Quinn created and that I fell in love with.Daphne is not a ""diamond of the first water"" in fact she is quite on the shelf. Her brother while being defined as a rake has always put his family first. Violet Bridgerton would have never allowed her son to speak to her as Anthony did in the first episode. The only characters that roughly resemble the book are Eloise and Simon.I have no issue with color of any of the actors; however it does seem a bit forced. That said the only reason why I gave this 4 stars is because of Page's performance.I waited so long for this and feel like the wonderful Bridgertown family and the differences between them and the normal 1800s British families have been so violated.",4
A mirror of self-absorption,"""Bridgerton"" is not my cup 'o tea. Ordinarily I'd pass on even commenting on it. But the construct of ""color blindness"" was so breath-takingly insensitive, I felt it was important to raise an objection. Romance novels are mind fodder for those unwilling (or unable, in some cases) to risk their own pride and feelings in actual relationships. Romance differs from ""love stories"" by being trite, overly simplified with a cast of stock players in stock plots moved around by the author like plays on a chess board. The cleverness of the moves may be the only thing that could be interesting...at least for me.""Bridgerton"" holds itself up a something socially daring, and it's breath-takingly the opposite. While giving the female characters a platform to voice their persecution and control by the patriarchy (all in a very ""stock"" way), the racial inclusiveness and what that's meant to erase is just wiped clean without a word of acknowledgement of the suffering white male (and female) society perpetrated on people of color. Like the snap of a finger, ""There! It's gone."" If you're not going to address the implications of setting people of color on an equal basis in society, why even bring it up? Because it's too complicated? Too painful? Or is it just unimportant and not worth mentioning? Despite claims to the contrary it comes across as the latter. And it's very offensive to watch no matter all that did happen in the summer of 2020.And while development of the material and its production pre-dates the world-wide uproar of racial killings in 2020, the choice to release ""Bridgerton"" could have been delayed out of sensitivity for the inane concept of casting under the auspices of ""color blindness.""That aside, a costume ""bodice ripper"" no matter the excuse of showing it from the female's point of view, lacks the authority of what Sofia Coppolla, for instance, did with ""Marie Antoinette."" ""Bridgerton"" is really just a rip-off of Coppola's work.And the entire effort is sunk by our attitude towards coerced sexual acts whether by a man or woman, which was dealt a serious blow by the ""woke"" movement. Dressing it up here and tying it in silken bows and fancy dresses and not even weighing in on its damage was a seriously retrograde choice. Fie on it.",5
Where are the book characters we love?,"I don't care what color the actors are or even about the inclusion of modern music, but I do care how the characters are completely butchered compared to the books. I'm a huge Quinn fan and this series, although welcome in theory, fails to capture the subtleties of each character and the humor of the narration. I want more period pieces on Netflix, yes, but please don't call this one Bridgerton.
I wish I hadn't read the books, perhaps I'd have enjoyed it more.",4
Feels quite shallow. Generally the acting feels very forced and a little plastic.,"I'm sure all the fuss about this series is due to the fact that nearly everyone in the world is in lockdown or under some form of social restrictions. As a result we are all bored to death and will latch onto anything that pleases the senses. The show has arrived during an extremely weak year for new productions and thus has little competition. I do like the diversity, refreshing.",3
It's a Monet....,"Watching Bridgerton is ""like a painting, see? From far away, it's OK, but up close, it's a big ol' mess.""This sums up my experience with this series which I abandoned after a couple episodes of season 1 (blander than boiled chicken) BUT I returned to watch season 2.Sigh...this show needed a Brit writing it. Everything is surface appeal. The costumes and sets are sumptuous, the acting passable BUT the storyline is a snooze. There is no intrigue nor tantalizing machinations. Just boring people trapped in a never ending marriage market. Even the few feminist are uninteresting in their constant protestations of equality but become weak in knees in the face of their masculine crushes.I don't know what it is about Shondaland productions but I always end up not liking or rooting for anyone. And that blows because why watch a show if you can't get invested?Watch if you're between shows.",4
Don't bother,"Don't waste your time on this unentertaining derivative dross. The misappropriation aspect has been well covered in other reviews. I could tolerate that, if Bridgerton has a decent plot, decent writing, likeable characters etc, but it doesn'tThis show is just another political vehicle to appeal to millenials. Nothing in it for the rest of us.",2
An embarrassing attempt at target audience based product design,"Complaining in detail about the painfully in-your-face writing, the abscence of any character development, the jarringly wooden dialogue, the ridiculously stenciled acting, the embarassingly obvious low cost music or the fact that a piece of media which at least pretends to be history related is not only pure fiction but also decisively disregardful of its matter would be a waste of time: It's not really an attempt at storytelling or filmmaking but rather a product designed by the numbers to appease the lower instincts of a strictly defined target audience. This is mainly done by the good ol' cheap humiliation of the reverse aggregate of people, of course handing out payoff after payoff without putting in the pesky effort for buildups.One extra star for the costumes which naturally are ahistorical but also the only corner that wasn't cut .As a postscript I do recommend scrolling through the reviews here and form your own oppinion on how this kind of reception could have formed a 7.3 rating.",2
Poor historical realization,"I had no idea how many black members of the nobility there were in 19th century in London. Apparently it's an alternative London anyway, it seems permanently bright sunshine. It rains only 2 times, because it was conducive to eroticism.
I liked the chemistry between Simon and Dephne, but watching them have sex for a whole episode? Honestly? The show is for kids, but they're not allowed to watch it because of all the sex. Poor historical realization. If you don't understand history, you should leave it alone.",3
Hot Mess,"So much of what I wanted to say has already been said in audience reviews about this comically inept steaming pile of historical revisionism that just a few words will do. The only positive outcome of what amounts to a serial version of fetid phlegm is that it has inspired witty and deliciously sardonic reviews by discerning critics. As for the professional critics tripping over themselves to virtue-signal their approval of this woke dreck, we see right through you. And we laugh, oh, how we laugh!",1
Superficial Diversity Game,"Can it be that the series like Bridgerton and Emily in Paris tell so much more about America and the American culture than about the Europe they strive to represent?
If so, the picture is empty and ignorant yet packaged perfectly.(read full review on tanya - gervasi . com )",1
Dissapointed,"Why do you have to ruin everything with your so called 'wokeness'? There are adaptations and then there is this mess. Was looking forward to a second season, but gave up at the second episode.",1
Overrated,"It is too girly, the plot is so shallow and it is not historically accurate. Overall it is corny",1
SAD,"The book was written to be fun, humorous, and light hearted. It was a great story. And it was more correct for the period.This adaptation was a piece of trash. The show writer and director both (and I use these titles loosely) took a great book and created well.... I have no idea what that was. Certainly nothing like the books.It is like watching a train wreck. Nothing bad about the actors. They worked with what was given to them. No depth of character that was in the books. This could have been so much more, instead it was ridiculously sad.",1
atrocious,This is easily the worst tv show i have ever laid my eyes upon. it is nothing but another netflix people pleaser and just an incredibly inaccurate timepiece remake of gossip girl.,1
Don't watch if your a fan of good acting!!!,"I had to stop watching after just a few episodes. I personally see nothing wrong with the diversity of the cast, accept the fact that the acting is just a no. The accents and voices seem so unnatural that when the writers try to capture over hearts it honestly made me cringe. The leading actress has vertically no personality and might as well be a plank of wood (I haven't gotten too far but still), and because of this I was more interested in the supporting couples. The set and wardrobe are really quite beautiful tho so I guess that counts for something (the only reason for the 3 stars).
I just hope that for the sake of my mother, who has decided to continue, the series get better!!",3
Pc rubbish,"Watched an episode because it was getting forced on me. It was a load of drivel, so much political correctness it hurt, the story may have been good but there were so many things in this that just wouldn't have happened back then it bewilders so much that you can't focus on anything else 😅",1
Bizarro World,"So weird. It's as if Hollywood fell on its head and lost its mind.Does anyone remember what a jewel Hollywood used to be before it became woke? When the stories were engaging, even riveting. When funny was funny and sexy was sexy. When they reflected reality, or fantasy, and knew which was which.When going to the movies was awesome.Watch movies from the 70's, 80's, 90's, and before. So many were awesomely good, whatever your taste. You will love them.It has gotten so bad, I don't even look at recently made movies or tv shows to see if I might like them. I know I won't.Hype away, Hollywood. It won't help you. You are in a death spiral. You belong to the Chicoms now, and you won't last long there.",1
Increasingly turgid and tedious,"It's chick-lit tripe like this that makes you realise how astonishingly brilliant Jane Austen truly was. Quinn is just another Austen wannabe who radically fails to capture any of the nuance.Shonda Rhimes' fantasy that England would cast off racial prejudice at the very time it was starting to ramp up its slave trade to industrial levels is grossly insensitive. Quite the opposite of being 'woke'. (And no, Queen Charlotte wasn't black, that's a B.S. theory that's been thoroughly debunked.) But at least it did give work to some superb actors and provide one of the most magnificent Afros to grace the screen, so I suppose some good came of it.",3
We all have nothing else to do,Most people are only watching this because there is nothing else to watch. Very dull. Noting special at all. It will only be a success because in pandemic times there is nothing else to watch,2
If you like pompous fake tales,"Of what being in royal company would be like this may be your cup of tea. The Brits are still a nation ruled by royals so don't let their stuck up insidious accents fool you, they are dumb as ever.",1
Cosplay and Cultural Appropriation,"Look, it's another turgid soap opera that uses mines Jane Austen's tropes to upend traditional roles, but really just strengthens them with all the terrible, Cinemax-level sex. Plus, in a time where people are bombarded by fake news from Fox to and inaccurate history in Texas schools, do we really need any more twisting of the truth? Why romanticize the lifestyle of oppressors, which were based on fiefdoms and class systems -- all about money, money, money? Why not focus on and dramatize perfectly good African and African American history? Frankly, it's not unfair to say this disrespectful to England's past and ethnic identity, which again, there is really no need to romanticize that more than it has been. What a wasted opportunity to try something new.",1
"Avoid, avoid, avoid",What utter drivel. Dreadful waste of 15 minutes. Switch off and watch paint dry.,1
"Makes no sense, only hyped by the media so others feel obliged to like it","This entire show is a mess and makes zero sense, it's a fantasy and the demographics absolutely don't exist in reality. People need to stop calling it a period piece as if it's a reflection of real historyIt's a fantasy world, and a terrible one.",2
Too many wrongs...,"Doth not a good make. Another ""new-age"" travesty. If you are making a period piece, albeit a whimsical one, the period facts and feel should be accurate. The acting is stilted most of the time, some younger girl actors are a little gems, but allaround the acting is uneasy and fake. Just as are the dialogues. The choices of the music are a sort of a bribe for a younger audience, but why? Massacres of perfectly good books is obviously a thing now.",1
Just awful!,"I've given up after watching half way through the first episode. Frothy, mindnumbing and certainly not aimed at anyone with more than an iota of intelligence. Ridiculous representation of the Regency period unless we are to suspend all belief. I don't think black people were part of English high society and certainly mixed race relationships were not the norm! Inane one dimensional characters, pantomime sets and costumes and anachronistic in every way which even if intentional just does not work. Also naughty sex scenes randomly thrown in with a view of a naked backside does not a decent drama make! What a load of tripe!",1
Not for all audiences,"If you're pre-adolescent and have no access to the internet, this series can sub in for basics of birds and bees. Or, if you're 12 and want an ideal romance in a fantasy world where color doesn't matter (however social standing, money and titles still matter), do watch. For all others, pretty much waste of time.",5
wtf,Horrible pls don't waste your time watching this! extremely disappointed in this,1
Netflix sucks more and more,"Cheap story, lousy actors and some sex. Wow. What an embarrassing garbage for deluded teenage girls and women who live in a bubble of unicorns and princesses. Whats wrong with Netflix? Did they really think people want to watch such crap? Let me tell ya Netflix: We do not want!",1
Virtue signalling in period costume,"So very period---as in 2021. I could only get through a few episodes. The series drowns in social posturing, finger wagging, and virtue signaling, That it is a period piece is just a fig leaf. It's not subtle. I like my entertainment sans being smothered by social lecturing, thanks.",3
CRINGE - stopped @ ep. 5,"We are at that point in the pandemic where people are willing to watch ANYTHING. i had absolutely no interest in this show to begin with but could not go on social media without hearing people talk about it so decided that i should maybe give it a go (it had to be worth my time right???). WRONG. IT WAS TERRIBLE, just as i had expected. daphne and simon have ZERO chemistry and are the most bland people i have ever seen on screen. how are we supposed to route for characters that we have absolutely nothing in common with and simply do not care about at all. THE BEST part of the show were eloise and penelope, but obviously they got almost no screen time and had no significant scenes. i hated how barely any other of the characters storylines were explored throughout the show.now let's talk dialogue, i found myself CACKLING during many of the lines in the back end of the series. simon and daphne trying to be romantic to one another was SO UNCOMFY. they seemed to have kept the direct quotes from the cheesy book and it just did not work well at all on screen. i would give examples but i just feel too gross typing them out myself <3.also, they have so much sex. why do we need to see it.lastly, the historical setting of the show was not believable whatsoever. it's as if they simply wrote a crappy season of a teen show but decided to make the characters wear fancy clothes and be british.",1
Bad editing and music,"The editing and background music (or lack of it at times) makes this show feel like it was done by inexperienced people. It almost feels unfinished, like the final editing touches and music were not completed.",4
Go watch a Jane Austen based movie,"Watched it cause everyone was freaking out about how ""good"" it is. Most bland, boring show I've ever made myself sit through. Just go watch the classic books to novels and you'll get so much more than this snooze fest will give you.",1
Jane Austin Smut?,"A Jane Austin adaptation which employs the withdrawal method as a means to deceive? Why would anyone disrespect her legacy in such a way? A period piece should at least attempt to approximate the morals and virtues of the time.
Netflix please!!! How could you possibly cancel amazing shows like Travelers but give us this??? I almost closed my Netflix account after Travelers was canceled, I surely will now.",1
Awful,Really disappointing. No real story. Beautiful aesthetic but terribly superficial characters.,1
What show is this?,"Stopped after 11 minuted. Maybe they can release this show on Sundays after lunch.. it's boring, good to make you fall asleep.",1
Should be more than 1 star but....,"A one word review would suffice: overproduced! A few minutes in and I started playing solitaire on my iPad. Trite, predictable script lacks any imagination. Very little competent acting, just uncommitted role playing. Extravagant sets and costumes do not compensate for an utterly predictable, unimaginative production. I really wanted to like this, and had to watch due to not being the only viewer in the room: but it's predictability was overwhelming. Stock characters, badly portrayed, in unimaginative storylines. As well, so many inaccuracies regarding the time period - makes you wonder if anyone did any research.",1
I didn't like,What happened to this series ?? Tell me Julia why did you sell your story? Why did you allow Shonda to change it that way? I am very disappointed !!!,1
Random history mashup to get hitched,"Okay, I stuck with Bridgeton until the end of the season. It's a bit of a guilty pleasure -and I wondered - just how bad can it get?The storylines are pretty dreadful and dated. Attempting an abortion via a homemade tea, zero sex education, and a hot/cold love affair. Forging love letters is pretty low.It's hard to emphasize with any of the characters. I'm not really sure why? The dialogue is stilted. The scenes cut sharply from one to another - there's no finesse in the editing.Perhaps the most intriguing bit - who is Mrs Featherington? When you find out, it's rather unbelievable and a let down.But then there's the liberal addition of black characters - but no other races, like Asians? It's bizarre considering the realities of the Regency time period.The show feels historically inaccurate in many ways.The costumes are overdone - it looks like someone got drunk and glued on way too many haberdasheries and jewels.The sets are tacky and tizzy - let's ram as many chandeliers and flowers in as we can. Let's over decorate the houses with way too much stuff.Bridgerton is a ""fan film"" of the books created with minimal historical research. It's simply a 'Mills and Boom' romance based on a fantasy historical period.",3
Had to shut if off,1 out of 10. Try to be too politically correct. Wrong feel for period drama.,1
YA Novel (with sex),"I see a lot of complaints about the acting but I think they did the best they could with the material they were given. The story is predictable and the characters are shallow and saccharine. I'm halfway through and I'm really unable to care what happens to any of them.There's plenty besides the diversity to indicate this isn't trying to be a true period piece. You have people who've never met doing outrageous choreographed dancing, truly bizarre music for the period, and side characters who must dress and act ridiculous. Two guys beat the crap out of each other for five minutes without a scratch? OK...but whimsy can't make up for the insipid script.I give it a few stars because it isn't completely unwatchable, and probably fun for teenage girls.",3
Utter rubbish,I made it to the second episode and couldn't take anymore. This is garbage. The acting is terrible. The storyline is painful. How this gets a rating over 2 is bewildering. Avoid like the plague.,1
#ReadTheNovel,I was waiting years and hoping that someday somebody make a film/series from the novels. And then we got this. So disappointing.#ReadTheNovel,1
"Forget diversity, the story is rubbish.",A whole episode of them getting it on and him pulling out. Is this what you really want to watch? Is this what people think up? Pretty messed up. I can only assume people have run out of things to watch. No man will enjoy this show unless his Mrs gets fruity after. Lucky him.,1
Lazy writing under the guise of fantasy,"First, I am a person of colour, whose people and country were subjugated by the British Empire.Now while we got that out the way, this show is an extreme embarrassment to all period dramas out there. I understand this is all interpretive fantasy, but it really is not all that much fantasy.
You see, The Witcher is fantasy, as you got magic, witchcraft, wizardry, mythical beasts, and also a heck lot of diversity. but that is great, it makes sense as it was an actual fantasy.This is not all that fantasy, it still depicts some reality in the regency era but for some reason, the buck stops at a racial utopia of relatively light-skinned black and white people mixing freely. What about all the many Asians, the Latinos, the Middle-Easterns, they did not get the same freedom in here?Furthermore, I would be furious if I see a show set in say West Africa that would show the same 'racial utopia', or any other scene for that matter.I like diversity, and would anticipate such if you show New York even in the 1890s, but a little accuracy goes a long way.Forced diversity is a problem, you gotta write a creative story with a pretext where you can include diversity, this is just lazy story-telling.",1
Insulting,"This is honestly the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. It is historically innacurate to be point of absurdity. At one point there was even a man with dreadlocks, in Victorian times! Are they kidding?It's all well and good saying ""it's not meant to be historically accurate"" but it's clearly meant to be set in Victorian England.The acting and accents are awful. Everything about this is a joke.",1
Boring.,I gave up after the third episode. Nothing happened. Far from Sense & Sensibility or Downton Abbey. I give them some credit for the costumes and I guess the acting is ok.,3
You have to suspend belief on this one,"If you expect a drama period piece, this isn't it. So many historical inaccuracies it boggles the mind. They also took modern songs and retooled them to that period's music style. They insert many races into the higher ranks of society, which leads one to think the ""woke"" generation could care less about society.",3
Started out ok but down hill sharply.,"While the ""queen married a dark skinned person and then created equality"" was a bit jarring at first, I got used to it and was enjoying the show at the beginning. Even with the Ariana Grande music played by orchestra. But then, there was a bizarre twist where the show turned into what was essentially porn. Every episode had minutes soon minutes of sex. The main character raped her husband... he was saying ""no, no, stop"" but she wanted to be pregnant so she forced him to continue. And this was portrayed as a good thing. This was one of several ""women, take your power, trick men"".Honestly, I never read the books. But this was not a good period drama. I love period dramas and this one was just bad. There premise had promise. But the execution was abysmal.",1
Flat and Boring Plus Stupid Woke,Black Aristocrat tells other Black aristocrat that they were integrated with White aristocracy because White king married a Black chick.😀😃😄😁Because Regency England had such a huge Black population including Aristocracy.😃😄😁😀Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!! How weak and absurd!!!!!,2
Waste of time & money,"Down to earth a bad series!! , waste of time and money!",1
Such potential - what a disappointment,"Despite the gloss, few characters are likable and the adult content was gratuitous and added nothing. Pity this story was left in the hands of an American.",3
Absolutely Disgusting,"Don't waste your time watching this stupid show. I regret doing that, do not repeat my mistake. Watch a boring documentary instead",1
"Politically correct, but historically incorrect","I really don't want to feel that when I watch a period drama it is cast with an eye to the BLM movement. That apart it is poorly scripted and the acting is wooden. The sets are good, but there's not really much else going for it.",2
Remarkably bad,Why are the characters all 30+ years old and just now coming out? And does Daphne have ANY other face than 'innocently surprised?',3
Avid Book Series Fan,It breaks my heart to see this beloved book series turned topsy-turvy. Casting was almost a 100% epic fail. It's a bit like casting Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher.,1
Ehhhh...Not Feeling It,"I was soooo looking forward to Season 2 of Bridgerton but was extremely disappointed. Season 1 was excellent and, surely, Season 2 would follow suit, yes? Nope, did not happen. It was so boring I almost fell asleep twice. This is not a good thing. I am not at all interested in watching the second episode of Season 2. Why is it so different from Season 1? Definitely a disconnect and not a seamless transition into Season 2.",3
daphne was so annoying,"It was the main reason why I didn't finish the first season - her annoying face. Sorry but she isn't that beautiful so it was funny for me from the beginning when queen called her perfect...come on
I always watch historical series to learn something, but here - everything is wrong and telenovela like....no thank you",3
"Beautiful to look at, yet mind numbing","Gorgeous lead actor...check.
Lovely costumes....check.
Beautiful set design....check.

Want soft core porn set to a period soap opera? This is your show!
I watched as many episodes as I could stomach but I just can't get into it no matter how many friends tell me it's great.
It's fluff.
Good luck to everyone watching and I hope you get what you came for. I'm out.",4
Painful,"Surely if you are going to place a series in a time and place, as the very least read a history book before hand. The diversity is laughable but it's not aimed at historical buffs but the acting is embarrassing. The whole show is definitely a show aimed at women who are too busy to notice how bad the show really is.",1
Don't Bother,Waste of time trying to get stuck into this series. I didn't connect with any of the characters and the plot made me yawn. Turned off before first episode ended.,1
Never touch this genre if it's not your cuppa!,"A night wasted.
I only save costumes, Claudia Jessie's brilliant attitude and Rege-Jean Page beauty (you can turn sound off if that's what interests you).
Downton abbey?? Austen?? Are you kidding?",4
Utter dross,Why bother with going up the effort for set and costume design if the actors are completely unrealistic? May as well have them wearing tracksuits and trainers and fiddling with Facebook on their iPhones.,1
It truly is horrible,"Me while watching: Why was this even made?
(proceeds to question the sanity of some friends who said it was nice. makes a mental note not to trust them ever again)Even just as background noise, I cringed.",2
Period Drama? More like Made-up History,You can't call something a period drama & then make it so historically inaccurate. Really disappointing show.,1
Too slick,"As a fan of historical drama I find this very annoying to watch, whether or not you can accept the concept of this being a re-imagining of the Georgian age for me the forced diversity still just feels... for lack of a better word.. forced! But apart from that it's the rich colours that every one wears, the perfectly manicured beards, tresses, make up. The modern dialog, the anachronistic music, I could go on.As a show itself it's pretty standard fare for modern young audiences But the object here seems to be style over substance. So while not dreadful, for me it's only watchable if you can ignore the slick pc correct production.",4
"So looked forward to it, but found it utterly boring","On the surface, it has it all and so much potential.
Great period in History, High Society, Class, fantastic costumes and then it falls flat on its A**.
The story has been told over and over and over again.
Family with many daughters, Important of status, Jealousy, Macho, Honor and poor choices.
And poor choices are something that is so utterly repeated again and again that (I) find it unbelievable and boring.
Too bad .... and what a waste.",4
looks like a parody!,"If this is meant to be a parody or a joke, then you've hit the mark! ""British royalty"" is far from being like that, it's just another unreal show, based on something historical... the acting is horrible, the plot and writing are as shallow as a saucer of tea, this show has nothing to do with the JA books just another netflix nonsense.",1
Ridiculous,Indians actresses playing British aristocrats in a regency period romance.What next? Tom Hiddleston playing Django? Netflix is going to ridiculous lengths to pander to the woke snowflakes for the sake of token inclusivity.,1
It is BAD,".Waste of time.
BAD, Bad acting.
The story is bland and the setup is unrealistic.
Gossip Girl low cost.",1
"oh gawd, spare us...","Look, if you want a costume romp and to forget the setting, this is your lot. Everything is so obviously an American writing on British historical society that the facts and manners are not so much ignored as put on a ship, sailed out of Portsmouth and roundly cannoned to the depths. All the British actors on set must have been falling about between takes with laughter at the whole shebang! Enjoy for the story. I'd say The Crown was more historical than this flight of fancy....",5
History re-written,This is historicly not correct. But instead of enjoying a movie or serie to escape everyday life and crazuness they come with this forced diversity thing. It just don't make any sense. It is unwatchable. It is cancel culture. Let's cancel our history and rewrite it. It makes me sick.,1
Cringe,"It's not a period drama, it's a teenage drama with costumes. Terrible music too. Just unbearable. Can't finish the first episode.",3
Urm no,"Terrible dialog, cliches galore and a lack of even a hint of detail make for a very poor period drama.
Saccharine sweet chick flick, low rate gossip girl scripts should leave off a genre that warrants a little more pedigree and care required to handle it.
Alas the dumbing down of the televisual arts continues.
Avoid.",1
I fart in it's general direction,"There I said it. It's vulgar, sure, but the show gets away with cheap vulgarity.",1
Oh dear,"Normally I enjoy Netflix productions but this is sadly very poor. Nothing wrong in trying to update the normal period drama but this is like a poor period soap opera. The characters lack any depth and the story lines are child like and over simplified to entertain the masses. The Netflix brief appears to be frocks, cleavages but forget a coherent story line. Dumbing down history has been done before but not as badly as this.",4
Not for me...,I was looking forward to this. Shame I can't watch Beyond the first half an hour. It's a load of over the top acting (May be intentional) even the voiceover was hurting my ears and put my teeth on edge.,5
Dreadful,I was hopeful but couldn't make it through the second episode. It was like an amped up Cinderella thing but just really bad and using talked English history. Horrible.,1
This is the start of something terrible,"Wow. Errgh... Wow.
I can hear the fake laughter on set, oh aren't we all so modern and cool, so progressive. As a m1xed r@ce person I find this type of show so insulting. Let's put a few of my kind in to any show now any period of history ( even made up), to keep us happy. One side of my culture can really see why people are starting to resent this type of PC drivel. Its everywhere, just fling one of us in to prove what? To keep bleeding heart woke liberals happy or people who like to wallow in self pity. Whilst the rest of the world laughs and shakes their heads.",1
I just wanted a nice regency romance and instead got trash,"Both the script and the acting are terrible. I could even forgive these if at least there would have been a minimum of chemistry between the two main characters, instead I kept waiting for the true love of Daphne to appear.
There is no attention to detail and manners, to the way characters speak and behave, these were essential aspects in society at the time.
Instead of a good romance we receive bad acting, tick-the-box diversity casting, terrible lines and not a minimum of care for details or creating the atmosphere.
I can't understand why it is rated so high, I guess it's just paid promotion.",1
Season two ruined what I thought was a show with a lot of potential,"I liked season one. Some people might say it was because of all the sex scenes or whatever, I saw those as a distraction to a fairly nicely entangled piece of writing that included a diverse cast of characters with different backgrounds converging to create the perfect storm of social commentary, character growth, and some lighthearted fun thrown in the mix, all wrapped up in a shiny fantastical Edwardian or Victorian veneer.One of the threads I thoroughly enjoyed in the first season was the one having to do with Simon and his upbringing, and his consequent decision not to have any children, in the thread that resulted in his entrapment and decision to leave high society.Season two replaces the intrigue with a very vanilla, wooden plot to out of Victorian literature. Not even worth watching even if you're just doing it because you're bored. The only things I liked about season two were the things that I liked about season one, the costuming and setting and the soundtrack.",3
Ruined,They have ruined such a great story. Season 2 is ridiculous and they ruined a wonderful story.The book and season two are completely different. I can't believe the author would agree to have her wonderful love stories torn apart and made completely different.,3
Pointlessly dull.,"Having watched 1 & 1/2 episode I can honestly say that this program is absolute garbage.It would seem that the writer has read half a Wikipedia page about the British Monarchy, smoked a load of weed and then made up some sort of rubbish story for a 5 year old book report.Awful.",1
Historically inaccurate,"Looks more like the English went to Uganda, wasted time, find some thing else.",1
Comedy / Drama?,I think I'm correct that it is more parody than anything else. Or maybe it's some parallel universe? There is nothing believable about it so cannot carry on watching it. My wife probably will though.,3
Soapy dribble,"Like Gossip Girl meets Downton Abbey. Is that a good thing? Maybe for a few escapist trashy hours, but like gossip girl, the fun probably wears thin and it becomes a boring rehashed soapy plot that no sets and costumes can save after three or four episodes.",3
My eyes hurt,"I would understand if this series would take place in some parallel reality, completely imaginary society like in Hunger Games or The Carnival Row which is copied though from something tangible, almost close as UK of 19th century... but in the very first scene the Author tells us: Grosvenor Square 1813. So we are in the heart of good old England of the 19th century indeed. Nevertheless we see a black man with !!! dreadlocks on a promenade and a black queen ""Charlotte"" half sitting half laying on her throne - scream of pain...You might think the production tried to show that no matter the color of skin, the beautiful actors and actresses may play the high British society and would be convincing, which is in my option just impossible, improbable ugh...Moving forward I was right, they didn't try to do this. From one conversation we learn that king George the 3td actually chose a black woman as his wife and improved the situation of black people in the society... no words.Have anyone from the production team thought about the educational part of the Television, what younger generation would learn about the history and manners of this series context. Shame. This must not be tolerated in the modern world.To sum it all up, this series is a Gossip girl of a distorted high society of an imaginary England of two centuries ago.",1
Simply unacceptable,"Any presentation of the past must be done with great care. While romance, as a genre, has always presented life through a rose tinted lens, it shouldn't skew realities beyond the sphere of its main protagonists. A romance set in Nazi Germany, for example, would be in very poor taste if it were to present a history in which the Holocaust didn't happen. Yet, in a sense, this is the path the makers of Bridgerton choose to take.Wish as hard as you might, but the past is the past; you can't rewrite history. But that doesn't stop some people trying, which is what makes this appalling show so insulting.Today, society is far from perfect. But, at least it is trying to address the mistakes of our predecessors. Race remains a huge issue, even now, in the 21st century, but things were far worse in the times during which Bridgerton is supposedly set. Those were dark times of slavery and oppression by the mighty British Empire over anyone who wasn't Anglo Saxon white.Bridgerton, on the other hand, doesn't quite see things that way. It portrays a past in which society's upper classes were multi cultured echelons in which the colour of one's skin was inconsequential. In fact, it idealises the past to such an extent that it reaches levels we are still striving to achieve now, centuries later.Presented in the modern day, the story would no doubt be quite engaging. It gains nothing, so far as I can tell, from its ""historical"" setting, yet in choosing that setting the story takes second place to the raft of blatant historical faux pas. The childish dialogue replete with ""Shall"" and ""Shall not""s, ""My Lord"" and ""My Lady""s is a future effort to make the setting more believable.",1
Poor,Predictable gossip girl alike series. I was hoping for something sophisticated but nope. Waste of time unless you are stuck at home with covid then maybe it will be a little distraction.,1
Eyesore,"The British high society where half the people you see are people of colour. It completely ruins the immersion. It screams ""forced"" from the get-go. If it was completely fantasy then fine. But you can't show such historical inaccuracies just to please the masses...",1
What a travesty!,"I have read the novels and enjoyed them so when I have seen the title, I was looking forward to watching the series. What a disappointment! Besides the fact that the characters lack any chemistry, the choice of actors for a historical movie based in the 18th century England makes the movie looking like a caricature. I could not immerse into the action, the story or the atmosphere because all was so over the top and fake looking. This is even beyond wokeness, this is incredible stupidity.",1
Meh...,"I loved the original book series so much! I really couldn't get enough! When I heard Netflix was taking this on as a tv adaptation I was so excited! but after watching their version of the series it left me feeling disappointed and a little broken hearted. The MCs that the Duke and I are are based on had no chemistry which had be bored!, they made pretty much all of the characters unlikeable that you were supposed to love!, and as this is a historical romance genre, it just did not have that feel to it at all!! There's a certain charm it needs and this show just did not have it.... I don't think I'll be wasting my time on season 2. Now I have to reread the book series to rid my mind of that awful show!!",2
Jane Austen if dramatised by David Olusoga,"The production values of the series were excellent, but that's its one saving grace. No doubt the diversity of the cast was designed to make viewers sit up and take notice, but it was more than a little ridiculous, if currently fashionable. I suffer from the delusion that if a programme is to feature a historical period, then it should reflect that period, and not some alternate reality.",3
What a yawn,It's really hard to get into this show. And this is someone who likes English period dramas. Considering all the good word of mouth I'd heard I think this is just really boring. Couldn't care less about the characters.,5
No idea why people are raving about this,I watched every episode in 2 days so it wasn't bad but no where near my top 20 tv shows. I watched it because everyone hyped it up but I still have no idea why! Very predictable.,4
hear me out,"This show is very wrong and i am not talkin about the diversity the show honestly that is the only part that is respectable!! i am talking about the language, the dresses( shape and colour). on top of that it has mediocare writing at best. this could have been done more gracefully ofcourse. the idea was fine while making it reality something went horribly wrong. And please do not just say a show is good because it is diverse it is very important being diverse yes try to look past the big corprations maniplations and see and hear everything not just like a show because it is a bit different when it is empty an 2 dimensional.",1
Nothing like the book,"When I learned there will be a Netflix series based on Quinn's Bridgerton books I was very excited for it. Now after watching all episodes (and it was very painful watching it I must admit) I'm very dissapointed. Like some others I wasn't thrilled about very benevolent casting, but let's put that sideways and focus on the transmission of the story about Daphne and Simon from the book to the screen.
There was only very few moments which I recognized from the book. I'm really trying to understand that netflix had to have a show and stuff but it's really hard to do so because they basically ruined one of my favourire book. Many of the sidestories(NOT in the book originally) were very unnatural to Quinn's vibes and very unnecessary. I don't know if J. Quinn had any word with how this is gonna turn up, but to me it feels like there is 1% of the book and rest is... well rubbish. Let's face it....
It's hard to explain to people who have not read the books how devastated I was when I saw what they've done to Anthony and I'm not talking about the plot with his mistress. I'm talking how they created this monster brother who forces his sister to marry a man she does not desire when in the book is exactly opposite.
How Simon and Daphne told everyone their courting was just a game (eventually) except Anthony who was the only one to know it in the books (from the very beggining). The situation about Simon lying Daphne that he cannot have children and everyting following that situation. Except the duel scene and the bedroom scene(which was only partly like in the book) there was everythintg wrong. The complete queen storyline was absolutely unnecessary.
And then few unimportant details like Daphne isn't in her first season, Daphne's hair colour, that their first, second or third child is not a boy and so on and on.. That are some details which can be quite easily transmited to the series but for some reason they haven't done that...
And not to mention they told everyone who is Lady Whistledown right now... In the books you don't know (unless you figure it out on your own) until the middle of the book 4...
I have to give some stars for beautiful locations and some acting.. sometimes..
If you are not a fan of the books I guess you could be able to like this. If you are a fan of the books there are two possibilities. One is not to watch it at all and stick with the books which are so beautifully written or you can watch this and appreciate the books even more.
If there is next season of this I beg creators... stick to the original story. It will be much better.",3
Disappointed,"While I was under the impression that I was watching something somewhat related to 1800s, I was distracted a lot by the adapted versions of popular songs playing in the background. Plus the characters are just too superficially portrayed.",3
The lead actress is the only good thing here.,"Yeah, don't bother. The whole thing gets wokidie worse as you watch it. If you fancy having your viewing spoilt with lecturing on wokisim then this is for you.",1
Not god enough!,"Everyone has some money, they come and invest money in the movie industry for someone and earn money. Art and message are missing.A good essay on the conditions and rights of men and women at that time. that is all. Good selection of beautiful actors and good coloring and telling Jane Eyre stories and feminism of the game. What has this got to do with people's current lives?",2
Does not compare to the books!,"I suspect anyone who enjoys this show has never read any of the books. I don't understand why they needed to be so different from the brilliant books. Awful show, political correctness gone mad, rubbish. I'll stick to the books.",3
POPPYCOCK!!!,"Awful, Dribble.. for the viewers who found this tripe appealing and sexy must be the one or two who also was easily pleased with Fifty Shades Of Grey... Dreadful!
A Pantomime Mockery..it was like going to watch a school play!!",2
Cringey,"I'm totally fine with the diversity of the cast. But the storyline is boring and unoriginal. The worst shows are the predictable ones- And this has every cliche in the book. Just throw them all in the soup and it makes a good meal? No.
Its pride and prejudice meets gossip girl. Each of which are great on their own. But we've all been there done that. Even during a pandemic, this does not challenge or entertain.",2
Horrible acting!,"I agree with the other reviewer, ""the story choppy, the characters cardboard cutouts and some of the acting very bad."" The actors are not acting, it's a flat recitation, they do not belong to this time period. The ... plot? Forget it.",1
Period Drama vs Spoof,"For the first few minutes, I was wondering if it were a SPOOF but I found I was wrong .",4
Fantasy gone wrong,"Put me to sleep in first 15minsSeriously what where the thinking , the cast to writing to acting everythings seems misplaced",3
Not great if you actually love period dramas of good writing,"The show is very beautifully filmed and the costumes look amazing. It starts out in line and tone with most period dramas, however, the dialogue is not a smooth and well written. Then it just goes on to get annoying and even laughable.I watched it over Christmas with my sister and we agreed that rarely had we ever rooted so little for a film couple both of whom are also quite unlikeable characters. Literally all the girl ever talks about is marriage and the guy as it turns out has the worst excuse in the world for not wanting to be a father. Moreover, they are terribly ill suited for each other.It feels like 50 shades of grey dressed up in regency style - mind you I'm also not a fan of that movie - with the same terrible dialogue to follow.I doubt I will be coming back for a season two, I think I will rewatch the new version of Vanity Fair which hardly got any mention but was ten times better than this show.",4
netflix standard fantasy novel,"Please do not watch this as a historical event. This is just another boring soap opera that is based on real people but complete made up stories.And the performances are so awful, the costumes loks like plastic, omg!",1
Waste of time,"Its a waste of time. There's literally no subject in it. I watched all of it hoping to see an action or a serious subject in it. The main idea is that she doesn't know what happens between a husband and a wife no one told her when she got married how this process happens and the whole season is about her figuring out what it is. Like seriously. Waste of time, each episode is 75 mins and literally nothing in it but stupidity.",1
Awful series,"There were so many assaults on my historical intelligence. I watched the whole series due to Covid isolation...think the Turkish telenovelas are much more worth watching.
I knew the series was bad after the first episode but kept watching hoping it would get better. Don't bother to watch even if you're bored!",1
Fantastic mediocrity,Disney and merchant/ivory have had a love child. Guaranteed to fill you with self loathing as you binge it to the end.,4
Implausible in the extreme,"Seriously? Poor script, poor acting, implausible characters, clumsy plots. This shambles could be used as an example of ""What not to do"" for aspiring screen writers, actors and casting directors. This is ""dumbing down"" in the extreme. Avoid.",1
There's Only One Reason to Watch This Tripe,"And that's for the gorgeous costumes. The series' writing is so bad it could be entered into a ""Write an awful parody in the style of Jane Austen.""",4
British version of gossip girl,"This show is like a British version of Gossip Girl. At first it's fun to watch then it just became eh! I do not think this is worth the fuss really. It is just me though, some really enjoyed this series.",3
"Loved Season One... Season Two Ruined The Show, Will Not Watch Again.","Initially, I loved the show. Loved season one. I was a huge fan of the books first, Benedict's book and Francesca's book being my favorites. But season two absolutely killed the show for me. And now they're going out of book order - Colin's story next?! The only thing season two had in common with Anthony's book were the character's first names. The entire plot was completely different. Not to mention the fact that we're still hanging onto Marina, a character who is briefly mentioned in the books in passing. Another story ruined by Netflix and Shondaland... I hope and pray that Netflix never picks up Sarah J. Maas's ACOTAR series.",1
Don't know what the fuss is all about,Not for me. I managed 10 mins. Just way too corny. If I get really bored I might give it another go - maybe.,1
gossip girl goes Jane Austen pastiche,"Bridgerton has all the ingredients of a relaxing and comfortably predictable soap opera.As a teenager I often watched Sunset Beach after school, and a practical thing was that the storyline went in circles in such a way that it didn't matter if you missed one or three episodes; you could allways catch up on the story anyway. Bridgerton works exactly like this. Another likeness is that it is engaging enough but the acting is forced and you never truly forget that you are looking at actors in a studio. The dialogue is heavy with old fashioned expressions but is neither very clever or funny.The biggest disappointment is the costume and scenography.The actors have heavy modern make up and wear costume jewellery from the 1960s and forward, combined with an endless display of boooring dresses: most of exactly the same cut. Such a waste of tailoring work!Some environments are clearly proper historical venues and it is very obvious when the story moves into studio environments. Outdoor scenes are just ridiculously fake.All in all. If you have some hours to kill, Bridgerton is a fairly enjoyable alternative. But I wish all this money had been spent on a script, a director, and a costume designer with skill and originality.",4
too long and basically boring,"This show was a little entertaining and the directors obviously wanted to show us that they got rid of racism by choosing black actors. but first of all, why not include more poc races?? and if you're going to get rid of racism, why not get rid of misogyny, bigotism and classism?",5
I enjoyed this show to a point.,"I have read many of Julia Quinn's books and loved them. I also love romance regency / historical fiction. This show was in no way accurate to the time era it was written for. If you're gonna have a show set in this era, you better make sure it's accurately portrayed!",3
Soulless Extravaganza,"Bridgerton is a mediocre rendition of the domestic novels that established the likes of Jane Austen to the helm of fictional writing in the late 18th and 19th century. Women's obsession with marriage - marrying into a financially sound family - marks the primary theme of Bridgerton. Obviously the agencies available to women in the period were rare and a good marriage (sadly!) was what they considered as a secure retreat from the brutalities if the world. Bridgerton picks up this theme but fails to establish a connection with the viewers as the characters are largely mechanical and hammy too in parts. Their emotions are hardly palpable and some parts are so uncharacteristic of the era it's set in. The protagonist, Daphne Bridgerton, is no Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood or Emma Woodhouse. She is one note and without actually caring for her the smooth/breezy screenplay just permits us to flow with her. You do not feel her awe or her joy or her troubles as you feel deeply how Elizabeth is in a dilemma - joy and shock - during her visit to Mr. Darcy's family estate, Pemberley.What salvages the show is that the narrative never bores. There's enough colour and celebrations and light hearted romance to keep you engaged through the running time. The show looks beautiful but we have seen better in ""Downtown Abbey"". The costumes though are at times just too eye popping instead of being eye pleasing. And who gave them the idea of playing ""Girls like you"" in the background for a show set in 1813 - it's such a put off.You may give it a try and flow with the tide but don't expect anything concrete. It's entertaining but fragile with emotions.",5
IT is not Bridgertons,"For me it wasn't about skin, but about beloved heroines from the book. I was expecting some familiar vibes, but no. We have foolish Anthony, Simon and od course Daphne. We have younger but plain mrs. Danbury. And oh, no, mean, stupid Penelope, my favorites.",1
What is this mess?!,"This show was so annoying. The costumes were horrible, it looked so low budget. Daphne was the worst- her dresses and jewelry looked like what a kid would wear, her bangs were horrendous, and I can't figure out the point of whatever they were doing with her eyebrows?! Everyone else had sculpted brows so it's not like they were trying to be historically accurate and it was plain distracting looking at her face. And although all the costumes weren't great, everyone else's dresses were much better than hers. Were they intentionally trying to make her the most unattractive person on the show? Eloise might tie for distractingly hideous dresses. But apart from it the costumes looking cheap, the acting and the dialogue was so boring. I mean it was a real struggle to keep watching it. I don't even want to blame the acting, maybe it was the script? I was so excited as I love period pieces and it looked like it was going to be campy and fun. I will be shocked if they actually make a second season. I won't be watching.",3
Too many historic inaccuracies,"I managed to watch 30 minutes of the first season and as much as I was attracted by the gorgeous decorations, and dresses, the historical inaccuracies were annoying.",1
Trash,"I will start by saying that the diversity of the show is great, I appreciate it. As far as the show itself it's trash. Another generic soap opera that lacks a true plot or actual story. The costumes are even horrible and cheap looking. Avoid at all costs.",1
Trash,Bad. So very very bad. The plot is corny and derivative.,1
This show is caca.,In only watched 30 minutes and I could not watch more. It caught my attention since I like history and I like time-period dramas but just 30 mins Into this show and I was just annoyed at the bad acting and inaccuracies. I know it's fictional but even then it's just not good. I don't understand how this show has a 7.4 when I've read other reviews saying the same thing that I'm saying. It sucks and you will be disappointed.,1
Cheap imitation,"If you're expecting to see something on a par with Masterpiece Theatre, or even Downton Abbey, you will be sadly disappointed. Don't waste your time. This is a big step down for the genre. A dumbing down actually. Quite silly altogether. 4 stars is very generous. I give that much for the actors' and crew's good intentions and efforts.",4
Terrible and a waste of time,"Poor acting , empty story, meaningless plot. Daphnie is so annoying to look at, and Simon is just unrealistic !",1
Only slightly resembles the book,"The plot is so different from the original it is almost
unrecognizable. The names of the characters are the same but that's about all. Why adapt a book for the screen and change it almost completely?This production is an insult to Julia Quinn's writing.",3
Typical,"A typical American production of an American book, supposedly, about Regency England.",5
Not as good as the book...,"The first season was amazing and although there were changes from the books, I felt that those were good changes for an on-screen adaptation. However, with this season the changes made little to no sense. There were many things that were added that convoluted the overall story. I believe that they wanted to create more ""conflict"" in this season but unfortunately it added nothing to the story. The things that were removed would have pulled the story together. I would say this season doesn't hold a candle to season 1 and I hope that they do not make the same mistakes with the next.",3
Not historically accurate,Why do we continue to recreate history and take away the relevance of the time. Equality is not sustainable.,1
It is discreceful,"How can you made a TV show in and exact historical time by being so inaccurate? In the 18th century in England black people were queens and nobles? Chinese were in the queen's court? How could they ever have printed and sparkling fabric costumes? If a white actor interprets Martin Luther King, or a Chinese Emperor, wouldn't you be disgusted by it? Seriously! How???",1
Cultural appropriation at it's finest,"It is kind of like Gossip girl, but more cliché with a lot of cultural appropriation added.",1
Good background tv,A good one to have on in the background while you're doing something else!Really predictable and cheesySeason 1: Two main leads initially hate each other but then realise they're madly in love.Season 2: Two main leads initially hate each other but then realise they're madly in love.,5
childish fantasy,"No historical accuracy in clothes, to begin with. The women in the show wear really tight corsets but none of them (except Lady Featherington) wear dresses to highlight their waists. In season 1, Daphne raped Simon but they just normalised it and moved on so I wasn't planning on watching s2 but I've been told that it was better than the first one. I surprised with the amount of chemistry the leads had, I'm gonna be honest. The first 4-5 episodes I was a fan of the chemistry, but after Anthony and Edwina's wedding, I couldn't ship Kate and Anthony anymore. I was just bored of them and started to root for Edwina instead. And the last episodes didn't change my mind about them. I didn't feel any kind of happiness when they got together or kissed or had sex. I just felt bad for Edwina. And when Anthony rescued Kate when she fell off the horse, it felt really cliché and like a fairytale. This whole show feels like that anyways... You can't be excited at any moment because you're so certain that the leads will end up together no matter what. That's why it's so boring and makes you feel all empty. The ending was anything but satisfactory.",5
Average,"Based on a series of victorian romance novels, Bridgerton follows a classic love at first site and troubles to follow tale in the fashionable high society of London. Big houses, fancy dress, and many a balls and dances, this show definitely deserves its emmy win for period and/or character hairstyling. The sets and costuming were fantastic, and they definitely took liberties with historical accuracy in a way that I think worked out for them, but only due to the ""soap""-like nature of the show. It ended up feeling like a well produced period hallmark series. With a major subplot surrounding a 21 year old who doesn't yet know where babies come from, if you like romance series, this definitely was one. Just not the type of show for me.",5
"Good,,,only if you want trash.","If you like sex on screen...this is for you. If you don't care about historical accuracy...this is for you. But if you want intelligent programs...this isn't for you. How about we make more dramas about African cultures and periods of history instead of something that never happened. It is insulting. ""People will watch a Jane Austinish show with black characters...but not a show about true black culture."" Come on Hollywood...if you want diversity...show it in the subject matter. Not in garbage like this.",2
Boring,"There are couple of wealthy families constantly having costume parties and trying to impress each other with their posh accents. To be fair i have no interest in 19th century British society life. Maybe that's why i found this so boring and pointless to watch. There are some jokes involved but i don't get it. Only good thing about this show is inclusivity of people from different backgrounds although it's historically not accurate for that day and age. I cannot say anything about acting of the actors and actresses as not sure if they were supposed to act bad. Anyways, it's over for me after 3 episodes...",3
"The more you progress in it, the worst it gets","I guess they tried to compensate the hollowness of it all with sex scenes, poor writers tend to do that when they cannot come up with anything else more enticing.
But even if we excuse the amount of sex scenes that add nothing to the plot and honestly even cheapen the show, the rest of the story is horrid.
They make a god awful attempt at portraying the struggles of being a woman back at that time, only to present a bunch of girls and women that actually have pretty good lives with no worries. Even Eloise, who tries to represent the need of women to take a different course, doesn't actually do a single thing for herself.
As to Daphne and Simon's relationship, i only have one thing to say: EWWW!Honestly, just a show about a bunch of rich people going to each other's houses and having no real concerns in life. Just the thought that this show is set during the Napoleonic Wars era, which gave way to Tolstoy's War and Peace, is an insult.",4
Let's just calm down and talk about it as civilized people.,"The choice of black actors was at least interesting. Is that a problem? Not really. In a perfect world, people would be bothered by the lack of black actors in period adaptations and would try to understand why. Perhaps that would solve some issues in today's society (yes, we live in a world that is still racist, don't be so shocked).
What was not that interesting was the breaking of customs, it denies the history more than the presence of black actors. I am confused by the need to integrate the society of the 21st century into the 19th century. But was it enough to make the show a disaster? Again, no.
Now let's talk about what really makes it a disaster: the books.
When Bridgerton's rights were acquired, it wasn't the big hype or the large amount of books sold around the world that were bought, it was the story, and that's where the production failed miserably.
Bridgerton is about family, it's about mutual support and love, a lot of love.
Each character is an important part in the construction of this family, somewhat eccentric for the time, but still functional and highly respected in society.
The production gave us none of this. It turned the books into a reality show.
It delivered a foolish Anthony, nothing like the responsible man that are always concerned about his family that we see in the books. His story with the opera singer was shameful to watch. It completely destroyed his character in exchange for nothing. Anthony is a libertine, yes, but leaving the family aside to be with his mistress? Wanting to introduce her to the society? Act like a passionate and jealous man, when everyone who has read the books knows that romantic love doesn't interest him for personal reasons? Completely hateful.
Violet did not show herself as the loving and respected mother, Colin was not the charming gentleman, Lady Danbury was not the sarcastic and rude woman that everyone loves to hate. A complete change of personalities.
That was the real problem of the show, the lack of fidelity to the book and its characters..
I don't care if the show is going to be portrayed on Mars, in the year 3000 full of romantic alien couples. But when you say you're going to adapt the story of a book, do it. Do not create a new story, this is not your role, the author already done that.
That's what I expected from Netflix and Shondaland.
If you haven't read the books, or even if you have read it and liked the adaptation, very good for you, really. You don't have to agree with me.
But if you read the books and didn't like it, like me, let's just hope that the second season will be more faithful and brings out the best of the characters.",1
Days of our Downton Abbey at ye olde Spearmint Rhino,"Hey ladies, looking for the next gossip girl or 50 shades of gray? Tell everyone you love Jane ""Austin"" but really you hardly ever read because books are so boring?

It's absolute nonsense but it has a dreamy man and is very ""romantic"" in a totally-unbelievable-yet-entirely-predictable sort of way.For everyone else it's best avoided because it's so hammed and cringeworthy you'll gnaw your own fist off before episode 1 has finished. Utter dross.",1
Cringy AF,I don't know who thought its a good idea to make this series. It was so strange to watch this fake history..and there's no real story behind this..,2
"Cheesy, predictable and graphic with bad acting","The acting is so weak and the characters are so shallow. Good looking people with zero talent every main character has an overused lines with most predictable romance ending. I preferred the supporting characters such as Penelope, Anthony and of-course Eloise.
I wasted hrs in this cliche series!",3
Couldn't care less...,..about any of the characters?! This might be the first show where by the finale I don't like or care about any character in the show. Someone go help these writers.,2
Utter Crap,"If you wanted to colorize my history, I guess you did an amazing job. Africans, ME, Indians leading high society is a bigger joke than white people in China or taking over the entirety of Africa during the same time period. This show is more offensive than anything that's come out in the last 100 years, and that includes the cartoon of Dumbo. Shonda Rhymes is a disgusting joke and should be shunned.",1
Exactly why.......,"I got rid of Netflix. I was willing to give them a 2nd chance after the Obama fiasco, but this sent me over the cancellation edge.",1
Cringe cringe and more cringe,"Pathetic ! While it is great to have a racially inclusive cast and show a world where people of colour are equal as a white person, but that doesn't mean you falter everywhere else be it the writing , acting or the sheer idea of the series! Only good thing about the series is Duke Hastings! Dhapne is unbearable and so are the other giggling females.",1
Colour-blind casting spoil sit all,Colour-blind casting puts the whole project down the drain. it's just disgusting.,1
The biggest hack of historical drama ever,"Why can't historical accuracy be enough? People who are writing this crap know that it will be taken at face value and the majority of people will never go beyond movie watching and will take this for historical fact, which it is not anywhere close to being accurate. For heavens sake, half the actors do not even try to use an English accent and most walk like they came off a subway. The jokes are stupid and the dialogue is horrendous. You have taken the one genre that was at least truthful for the most part and completely ruined it. For amateur history buffs like myself, small differences to make a story enjoyable are great but do not take actual human beings and events and pass them off as accurate history when the majority of what you are showing is inaccurate. There is fiction for that. Complete trash. Even the costumes are horrendous.",1
Garbage,This show is hard to watch. I've tried 3 times to watch the first episode and couldn't tolerate it.,1
Not pleased with the adaptation!,"I genuinely loved reading the book series and was very excited when I heard about the adaptation. I just finished watching the 1st episode and while it is obviously a lavish production, I am not pleased with the changes in the way the characters act and behave. I'm not talking about the unique casting - all of the actors are talented and beautiful to look at. What displeases me is the apparent changes to the actual characters. They do not speak, act, or behave like the characters in the books. The names are the same. The setting is the same. The plot premise is pretty much the same but I am very put off by the changes in the actions and speech of the screen characters opposed to the print characters upon which they were based. Beautiful costumes. Beautiful set. Beautiful people. Lousy adaptation.",1
HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I'm a big fan of Julia Quinn. I read all the books in the Bridgerton series and liked most of them. So clearly that's why I hated this. At one point, I wanted a screen adaptation of these books. I still do ... From someone else who won't destroy the storyline. I'm SO sick of modern issues being forced into historical settings. And when it's done so poorly, it's doubly offensive.",1
A snooze fest,"I was never a fan of Shonda Rhimes, How to get away with murder was probably the only show I could tolerate, mainly because of Viola Davis. I should have taken that as a sign that I wouldn't enjoy this show. I did watch it though, and it sucked. I'm a history buff and movies such as The Favorite are what I would enjoy watching, but this show is just boring and irritating. The characters are all shallow, they are unlikable, the acting is meh. Storyline is ridiculously predictable. They are better shows out there.",2
Coming Soon To Netflix....,"With the so-called ""success"" of Bridgerton, Netflix will soon be re-writing history with films based on: ""If JFK had lived""...""If Abe Lincoln hadn't gone to Ford's Theater.."" ""If The Titanic hadn't sunk..."" and ""If slavery hadn't happened...:""
Complete garbage.",2
Why?,"The novels were horrific to begin with, and terrible examples of historical fiction to boot. Why anyone would want to make them into a television show, fantasy or not - and lets be real, Bridgerton is pure fantasy without a drop of history - is beyond me.Let me be clear: my issue is not with the lack of historical accuracy. It's pure fantasy and acknowledges itself as such. No, it's just poor storytelling, which is much worse. I watched half of one episode out of a combination of boredom and masochistic curiosity. I regret to say, that's time I will never get back.",1
costume drama for kiddies,"I honestly don't see why people get excited about this show. Terrible writing, terrible acting, and the sets?... Well, consider that displays of candle lights are obviously displays of electrical (Christmas) lights, and you'd have the gist of the vibe.I reckon a show like this digests well for someone coming home from high-school and thirsty for pulp... but if you want some quality television for your evening, I recommend to steer clear of this.",3
Disappointing 2nd season,"First season was ok. Main male character very much based on Austen's most famous male character. The diversity, dressing and most of the actors were nice. Second season was terrible. Nothing of any sense turned out to happen. Very disappointing. The Sharma eldest sister could have been performed by a much better actress, her performance was too weak. The plot left much to be desired, very disappointing indeed.",1
None achingly boring.,"The British Georgian/Regency Queen with an afro. Oh and the writing, directing and acting is of the very worst. Shame.",4
Total tripe,"I'd heard so much about Bridgerton that, despite my lack of enthusiasm for period drama, I decided to give it a go. Diversity, current music, *whispers* sex: I was expecting something groundbreaking and exciting! Alas, it was a complete snooze fest. Same old rubbish; women desperately seeking men to feel validated, some swooning and fainting for good measure, falling for the 'bad boy' and... not much else. I understand that marriage would have been important at that time but when they've clearly tried hard to add a modern twist to the period genre, why not use it to actually say something? All attention-seeking, surface-level rubbish with no substance - abandoned after a couple of eps.",3
Did the producer and director miss history class,"This was embarrassing to the black community, to history, and to TV. Acting is almost adequate. Class situation was absurd. History was rewritten poorly.",1
Very plain story with diversity,"The storyline was very plain and not surprising. I could see they try to incorporate diversity but it ended up with disrespecting history and making the setting contradictory. For one thing, they decided to stick to the historical background but for the other they decided not to. It is ok to change them, but if they do, they should have made sure that it was well constructed.
I also wanted to know about the characters and culture at this era in depth. The struggles women had at this era didn't really speak to me.",4
Don't do it,Historical inaccuracies is big with me. I once turned off a historical movie because he didn't look like the main character. I get it it's a fantasy but common now can't we try to get it a little historically accurate. Even Guy Richie gets it a little and he has Queen playing in the back ground of a knights tale lol,1
I'm heartbroken,"I saw the trailer and costume review and I was curious. Not terribly interested, but I knew I had to read the books first. I think the majority of book readers transforming into TV series watchers had the benefit of having time to forget the plot. I had no time. And I was devastated by this.I stopped after 2 minutes to point out that I hate the costumes, the set design and the hair.I loved the diverse casting and I was uncaring for the modern songs. I was quite open to viewing this not critiquing the race (historical accuracy or not), the embellished colours of costumes and the set designs. I just decided to put them all into a basket named 'it was an artistic choice' and as such I viewed this series as being set in a fantasy realm.So my review will not touch on those 3 points at all.
But I will focus on the hair. That could have been helped. It was a delightful and charming scene with which the book opened and it was this elaborate joke Whistledown shared that it was funny how all Bridgerton siblings resembled each other and in no way their blond mother. Even in those 2 first minutes I mourned the clever writing of Quinn they just decided to abolish.And onto the characters themselves:Violet: every single encounter with Violet in the book, or even if she was just talked about by her children, you just knew she was loved. In the first ballroom scene we already know how funny she is. But in this series she's just a wallpaper, the only semblance of a great matriarch she is, was shown in this one scene showing her love for her dead husband.Anthony: in the first book he shone, you just had an itching to get to the second book to have him get a happy ending, to see what he does. He was charming, supportive, a beautiful soul through and through. In this series I just hate him more with every single episode. It felt like there was no connection to the family. And I just don't think that he deserves a story in this TV series universe at all. And by making the glue of the family being the opposite, the whole family has lost any appeal.Benedict: I think that we can't get him any kind of magical story if any good points are already released in this first season. He fell in love on first sight. And Sophie was marked as being special when the Bridgertons remarked that Benedict was noone of consequence, and Sophie let it slip that he draws. She was a servant who knew him better than his family. At this point there's no need for his story at all. It will just be cheap.Colin: I have not a lot to say except for that it just twists the dagger in my heart whenever he's on screen, he's uninteresting, bland and simple, when in fact he was supposed to be a charming traveller who did not know his place in the world of accomplishd siblings until he got together with Penelope.Daphne: she was supposed to be on her third season, firmly heading to spinsterhood, beautiful, but nothing special, and the best of the best friends (firmly in the friend zone) of all the marriageable men. And her first encounter with Simon was supposed to show how down to earth she was by dealing with a dimwitted but kind suitor (I really dislike how they dealt with Nigel here). Everything in this series makes her uninteresting and whiney.Eloise: frankly nothing bad to say, kind of even enjoyed her smoking habits (I guess she's the reason I didn't rate this lower) - and maybe proof that I don't need and an adaptation - she's very unlike the character in the book, but at least she's faithful to the spirit of her.Penelope: her story is completely ruined here, and I don't a see a way back to her wonderfully sweet personality. Even the father's presence (who was most definitely dead in the book) ruins the Whistledown storyline. I just hope that this gets cancelled and we don't see how the story writers will butcher her up.Marina: her presence quite ruins Eloise's future story as she was supposed to be Bridgerton cousin. I just don't understand why story writers had felt the need to squeeze as many book contents into this one season.
Lady Danbury: she was witty, shrewd, and in no way connected to Simon's childhood developments. Her presence here was a breath of fresh air in terms of everything else being bland, but nothing actually interesting.Simon: his whole story arc was relatable because you could hear his thoughts and why he actually broke through the stammer. Lady Danbury's involvement made it boring and cheap. Simon was supposed to get over his stammer because he was smarter than everyone and stubborn.Feels like the writers decided to get rid of any comedic and worthwhile things to portray and just decided to take and fill it up with new characters that don't change the outcome and make you mad instead:Prince and Queen: If they had been wonderfully written and would add to the story instead of detract I'd be all for them. But WHY?So, if you've bared with me till this end:
I hate this, I can accept differences in characters and storylines, but don't make them all worse than the original. And in spite of all that, I wanted to drop this so many times, starting at the 2nd minute of the series, that must be a record or something!
And I'd say, don't trust the 1/10 and 10/10 reviews, this TV series doesn't require any sort of extreme rating, it is horrible in it's blandness alone.",3
Beyond LAME,Why rewrite history to placate the ego of a special interest group? The casting choices are so far from reality it actually turns my stomach. Why not use puppets or talking animals instead - at least then it would have interesting charm and originality?,1
Poor excuse to see beautiful people making out using regency like gowns.,"I wish I could give this a 0 star rating, but unfortunately the plataform does not allow it.
Quite honest I didn't expect much from the beginning but it blew my mind how bad something with such high budget can be.
From mediocre acting to a poorly developed romance, this serie is a complete waste of time (unless you enjoy fantasy romance without any true passion).
There is absolutely nothing regency there, except de similar silliuete in the clothing, and I say similar because they are not regency gowns, and some of them looked cheap.
The OST was pop music on violin, didn't go well with the ambiant or dances or nothing for a matter of fact, the CGI façades made me laugh a little, it kinda felt like Age of Empires.
The characters were the classic f boy that falls for the delicate and pure lady, the femist that does not represents feminism at all, the clueless chubby ginger that lives romance throught someone else, the gossip old lady, a queen that looks more like the tree in children's play (she does absolutely nothing) and a whole lot of other characters that you can easily forget the names or that they even exist.
I tried my best to finish this and not drop it, but I felt a total waste of time. I could forgive a lot if they played it like a true fantasy, not giving exact location and date, but they did and it was just bad.
If you want to watch good historical romances, there is a LOT of good options, going from The Crown, Harlots, The Tudors, Downtown Abbey and The Great.
If you crave fantasy go watch Disney live actions like Cinderella or Maleficent, but if you want something more spicy, even Outlander might be a better option.
For me the best thing about this series is that it have an end, and I still can't believe they are going to squeeze a second season out of it. If you really liked it, you do you, this is just my most sincere opinion.",1
Soap Opera,"It would be good to actually see a colour blind casted movie or tv series that was not based on complete drivel. The source material for this was bad enough then made worse by removing all semblance of writing! I'm disappointed because if the script is well written and inspired then colour blind casting will work. Until someone in a position to commission has the guts to do this though, this kind of show will only continue to reinforce the stupid idea that it cannot be done.
If you are looking for complete fantasy, light fluff, with half naked people then this might be for you, if not it is best avoided.",1
It's a shame people to see the true colors!,"So after debating whether to watch the edgy Bridgerton on Netflix, I did.
Some may see the full color cast and I applaud their modernization of an old classic but please don't miss the subtext.
The Black Girl gets pregnant out of wedlock and yes of course, the Black Duke is absent his father. Bravo Netflix and thank you for perpetuating another stereotype of old society. Let's not forget that these factual disparities plagued upon the Black race was forced and families broken up purposely to perpetuate a cycle of poverty and strife.I refuse to watch anymore after episode 2 32.15 minutes in.
As a man with a daughter living under my roof and fully supported by her mother and I, this makes me ashamed of those who still write scripts this way and act as if they're preaching solidarity or equality.",1
Absolutely appalling drivel.,"I can't.....I don't know where to start. The stupid premise, the idiotic plots, the characters speaking in Jamiacan-mun accents of the English upper class, the effusive costumes................what's the point. If you liked this twaddle, there's no hope for you.",1
"This is about a TV show that failed its author, and an author who failed her book.","Although I love period dramas (English, Chinese, literally any), I could not like the main leads of this series. The plot is also underwhelming. That is not to say I did not enjoy the show. I enjoyed the supporting cast very much, adored the costumes, the lovely voice acting (<3 Julie Andrews), the cast did an excellent job and the music is wonderful. Having said that, I simply could not bring myself to like Daphne and Simon. This was prior to the part where Daphne sexploits her husband by guilt-tripping him into having a child (I was absolutely mortified, not by the act alone, but by the rubbish that she spewed after that). There is far too much sex in this show without much substance. Daphne's character did not grow, she is simple-minded and selfish, wanting only to marry an affluent husband (""love"" she claims, HAH!) and to bear children. Simon is no better; being a vengeful manchild, who makes a vow that he ultimately does not keep. Yet, they are both praised by all and sold by the TV producers and writers as the most esteemed bachelor/bachelorette. Though the setting carried an Austenesque feel, it left me wanting and huge gaps that I feel will never be fulfilled in subsequent seasons. Eloise's personality seemed more to my liking and in the beginning, seemed like she would redeem the show, but the actress came across as rather annoying and that really put me off. My favourite is Lady Danbury, she was an absolute thrill to watch and honestly, the only reason anyone should watch this show.In contrast to another reviewer's comment, I may be Asian and one would think I would support the diverse cast, I do not. Though I can see past colour (some of the actors are no doubt great at their roles and I would certainly not have it any other way), it is a little irritating that this has become such a big deal in casting and producers feel a need to hire people from all backgrounds. Personally, I would have liked retaining a white cast for no other reason than the fact that it would be more historically accurate. Just think about how ridiculous it would look to have a historical Chinese drama with 10 white guys in the background. Inclusivity is one thing, inclusivity and compromising authenticity is another.P/S: I have not read the book and if the book is anything like the show, I will probably never touch it. All I know is Julia Quinn wrote it, and played a huge role in the casting and production of this series.",4
Really?,I get this is not an accurate historical drama I can get over that fine. My biggest problem is the two main characters Daphne is so dumb like she really didn't know how babies are made? And Simons vow was stupid how about just be a better dad than yours was? The fact that Daphne didn't know what the pullout method was and had to ask her made weeks into the marriage really had my eyes rolling I guess she was sheltered but this is just ridiculous. A simple conversation between these two would've saved us eight long episodes.,4
Complete Trash with a few fun moments,"BridgertonSeason 1Bridgerton, based on a series of books, by Julia Quinn, details the life of British high society during the summer of 1813. While the characters of King George and Queen Charlotte are based on historical fact, the rest are inventions by the author.The audience gets to watch the Bridgerton family's oldest daughter, Daphne, work to land herself a husband. In the meantime, her younger sister Eloise chastises the system for turning women into horses or cattle made only to produce children. It is appalling to be sure, but the series brings forth nothing but trashy romance tropes made to excite the audience. I found it enjoyable, as most people did, but it still must be pointed out how bad the writing truly is.In order to move the plot along, especially in a time period where secrets were closely maintained to avoid scandal, Lady Whistledown is invented as deus ex machina. This is a pseudonym to conceal her true identity so the gossip can continue to be spread amongst the city. This literary method can be effective when used properly, but it is the sole impetus to continue the series. It was not difficult to guess her true identity, but this proves problematic for the audience because then her presence is no longer as exciting.I also have a problem with the use of today's popular music being used at the balls, performed by stringed instruments. It is very distracting, regardless as humorous as it is.I'm being very harsh on this series, especially since I said I like it, but there are hundreds of period pieces out there that handle the subject matter better. The war of 1812 isn't even mentioned. The King regent isn't even mentioned. I felt like I was watching a middle school play where modern themes were explored with a random backdrop used. And worst of all, there is zero character development with but one message that I did enjoy.While men could do as they pleased, and women could not, rare appearances of love did occur. Daphne and Simon, whose plot line is as ridiculous as the rest, did get a moment worth mentioning. Love is not an emotion. Love is complex and is the sum of many different emotions. But the notion that love suddenly begins with no end has been romanticized for far too long. Daphne's mother reminds her that love is a choice. A person has imperfections, qualities that are not ideal, traits that could be infuriating, but to choose to love is to accept all facets. I was quite pleased to see that idea put forth, when trashy romance tends to ignore it.",3
Why?,"I haven't read the books that this series is supposedly based on, but why should we really care how faithful the adaptation is? Shouldn't the production sink or swim on its own merits? And all this discussion about whether it's appropriate to have people of different races playing historical figures. In the case of this production, I think discussions of race, feminism and historical accuracy deflect from the fact that it is... boring. If you enjoy watching the same over and over again ad nauseum, tune in. It's a photocopy of almost every PBS period piece I've ever seen. And photocopy in the sense that it's not quite as good as the ""originals."" And there is certainly nothing original about this story. The acting is okay - I doubt Netflix will garner any Emmy or Golden Globe acting nominations from Bridgerton. Costume or cinematography nominations? Sure, why not. Really all I can say about Bridgerton is... m'eh.",4
Who knew?,"That Regency London was so ethnically diverse? Apart from that (which was laughable), it was an entertaining way to spend Christmas Day afternoon after a hectic lead up to the day and a tummy full of food. I've certainly watched far worse and frequently, sadly.",5
"It's nothing but ""Gossip Girl"" set in the Regency Period.","Costumes are great. The sets are perfectly lush but I really don't care for the writing, the acting or the pacing. People screaming for historical accuracy need to get over themselves.",3
"Outstanding Production, Awful execution","Brilliant staging and production value but with 'story' that take 4 episodes to establish more than one plot-line and a complete season where the costume department was told to give every character away, there was no intrigue or mystery. That's right - the lead characters are eye-candy while everyone is gaudily portrait as mean-spirited with gross overstated costumes. The only thing we learn from this alternative period shlock is that unlikeable characters have no dress sense. A complete yawnfest. Clearly executed in the wrong hands. In the hands of the someone like the ITV or BBC this would have been talked about for years.",1
Just plain boring,"I tried to watch Bridgerton twice. The first time I only got through half an episode. After a friend told me she really liked it, I tried again and pushed through to the third episode, but I couldn't go on. This show is just so boring. Nothing happens in the episodes, the characters aren't interesting, and the ""drama"" (if you can call it that) is so cliché. Not good.",3
Season 2,"Having read all the books the Viscount was my favourite so my expectations were high. How disappointed I was. I appreciate that sometimes there is a need to change aspects for the TV element which I understand. But this version has totally killled the writing of the book and spoilt the frame/angst that was felt in the writing of the story. I was so looking forward to this being portrayed into tv/screen and sat aimlessly for hours waiting and hoping it had been delivered to be sadly disappointed...Why do producers/directors feel the need to change such amazing writing/stories just to get their versions out there. I am most annoyed at the writers for letting their stories be manipulated for, I don't know greed/money or public exposure!!!!!",4
Boring Season 2,"So much talk, my head hurts, and nothing happens in the first three episodes. One would think the viscount is more fun. The little wannabe wifey is beyond annoying with her sing-song voice and facial expressions. Music is nothing like in the first season, I might have watched it only for that.",3
Regency romance is rarely riveting,"Let's be honest, I'm not the intended target. I find regency romances' tendency to ignore history for the sake of sexy intrigue to be tiring. Bridgerton, while nothing new or unique (gossip girl meets Georgian era), is fine, actually. The episodes carry you along all right, even if you know exactly what's going to happen. The cast is skilled, and I appreciate that the casting - while not colorblind - is at least diverse. It's not in anyway special, and to anyone with a critical mind it isn't much more than suitable background noise-entertainment while you do something else.But I cannot abide Eloise. You cannot cast a 30-year-old woman as a child and make it believable. Every time she does something young I can't help but laugh. It's so unbelievable. The actress, I'm sure, is talented, but she cannot be seen as anything other than a grown woman. She has a deep voice, a mature face, and has done a fantastic job in other mature roles.What we're they thinking??
It's. So. Bad.
It ruins even what little the show had to offer.",2
Very familiar...,"Pride and Prejudice meets Gossip Girl and Fifty Shades of Grey, the scenery, costumes and decor are excellent though.",5

Not that I have even watched that either but I can get the gist and similarities. I couldn't even force myself past 2 episodes of this drivel. Bore fest and absurd and unnecessary. But the tiktok generation is eating it up apparently. To hell with history and good writing or scripts. Just write smut and stick a regency dress on it and call it a day. Add a black queen and now you're woke so even more bonus points. Yeah!It's definitely not for me and really a disservice to the era and the genre.",2
A bad comedy,"It is time for BLM and I do pay respect for this slogan.

"A ""politically correct"" fantasy made for leftist dreamers","First of all, the show is said to ""set against the backdrop of Regency-era England"". Considering the fact the Regency era lasted until 1820 and slavery in England was only abolished in 1833, there is no way there is a black person in the top-class noble society. The fact that the show makes the main character a black person is obviously a way for the director to showcase their political opinion while throwing away all the historical facts. This show is just another typical example of ignoring the slavery past and inventing own fantasies, for the sake of making profits.",1

Insufferable,"Review is for Season 2. Historically inaccurate to the last detail🙄 I love history so couldn't bear it... while watching this show, one must suspend reality.... This series is supposed to be 200 years back when there were hardly any inter racial marriages, let alone even inter mixing in society & white wedding dresses was not the norm. This became popular only after Queen Victoria wore it at her wedding because white was her favorite color & then it was a marketing strategy to label it as ""virginal white"" in later decades.It would have been better if they could actually show inter-racial marriages while actually talking about how it was perceived in society then. Would have made more sense to understand how things have evolved since then.",3

Overall, they could've cut at least 3 episodes out and several sub plots that went nowhere. Really the only truly good thing I can say about this show is that Golda Rosheuval's turn as Queen Charlotte was absolutely excellent.If you like looking at attractive people acting out tired trashy romance tropes for 8 hours, this is for you.

"It's Not Bridgerton, It's Featherington","If the show hadn't deviated so far from the book, it would've been more enjoyable. It started out promising, adding layers and color and a bit more substance to the first half of the book it was based on, then started throwing in random characters and plots that had nothing to do with it. Marina, Colin falling in love (when he actively avoided marriage until his own book, which was the fourth in the series), the absurd scenes with the Queen when she was never even mentioned in seven books (and multiple second epilogues) of the series. Turning Mrs. Featherington into a villain who locks women in their rooms and threatens them? Horrendous.Anthony being the most unlikable character and nothing like his literary counterpart, trying to arrange his sister's life without her opinions, making you hate him from the first few episodes all in an excuse to show that Daphne is a strong, modern woman. A better story would've shown that she is that with a supportive and loving brother at her side, the way we know her to be. But the further destroyed his character by creating an obsession with his mistress that would've had book-Anthony rolling his eyes in absurdity. Why should we be excited about season 2 when they've done everything to ruin the leading man's character? Anthony Bridgerton was the head of the family, but let his mother make most of the important decisions for his sisters, while he focused on making sure they were provided for and making sure the family's reputation was impeccable because anything less than that would harm his younger siblings. He liked women, but felt strongly about none - even when he decided to marry, it was for the good of the family and not because he wanted a significant attachment to any person. Netflix-Anthony shares nothing with him, except the same hair color. The idea that he would invite his mistress to his sister's ball? So ridiculous I nearly fell out of my seat. He NEVER would've embarrassed his mother that way or ruined his other sisters' chances at good marriages.And the second reason the series is so disappointing: We didn't spend anytime with the Bridgertons! Most of the storylines, aside from Daphne and Simon, revolves around the Featheringtons/Marina and their household. We barely got a glimpse at Bridgerton House or the dynamics of the family. Violet seemed to be pulled along by the wave of her family, instead of setting the tone and being the strong and capable widow she is in the books. They cut out the best storylines they had in front of them with the family interacting with each other and taking the humor out of the story in favor of gambling plots, boxing matches, the Queen's appearances, an unwanted pregnancy, and unmasking Lady Whistledown (which should've stayed in its place, with book 4, where it belongs). It's like they ripped the book in half, used what they wanted and then created an entirely new ending.And now for Daphne and Simon. These two are wonderful together. Their chemistry is great, they look fabulous when sharing the screen, and when they were given good material to work with, they sell it. It's clear the casting choices were impeccable, knowing that these two would need to lead season 1. It's a shame they didn't put that focus on the rest of the cast. It's like they didn't expect there to be a season 2, since they obviously didn't want anyone interested beyond Daphne and Simon. The Bridgerton brothers are supposed to carry the next three stories - how can these particular brothers do that when viewers hate them? How can they not see that they brought Simon to life and left the others to be caricatures? The brothers all look tiny, when they're supposed to be large men. They could've cast three actors who had as much charisma and looks as Simon, instead they look like short little boys, looking up to see his face, when they should be imposing and staring eye to eye with Simon, not a head shorter and scrawny.The sisters were all annoying and didn't fit the looks - Francesca is supposed to be the most beautiful, yet the one tiny glimpse of her and she looks like she would be better cast as Penelope.And the ending. What glimpse we had of Daphne and Simon at the end, again barely stayed close to their story. Simon telling her they would live separately? Where was Daphne going back to London? Simon showing up at her mother's house only to be hilariously put down by her butler? The pregnancy he thought was truth? His agony when he realizes how much he loves her and is scared for her safety and realizes how much he wants a child? The Bridgerton brothers showing up at Hastings House, only to be forcibly removed by their mother (in one of the funniest scenes in the series)? But it's okay, the sex scenes are frequent, so don't worry about keeping the tone and humor. *Insert eye roll here.* And making their first child a boy when they first had three girls - there's nothing like hitting that strong feminist statement home like wiping out the existence of three girls to give Simon his heir! At least they mentioned that the name should start with A (even though their first son was David in the book).They did three things perfectly: the costumes were fantastic, the casting of Simon and Daphne couldn't have been better, and getting Julie Andrews to narrate - she was impeccable!They should've bought the use of Julia Quinn's characters, called the show Featherington and considered it a spin-off of the books.",3
Not to criticise,"A genre that I don't like.And I hate those who can't stand what they call a woke agendaIsn't it a tad weird though that all of a sudden half the nobles in England are people of colour ? Nicely inclusive (with Ann Boylenn in Black recently, who knows). Last time I checked, the Black American princess coudn't cut it. When was it it ? Two years ago ?It's a past tense soap-opera. But still, wrong on so many levels; cindarella is more realistic in the age of The Windsors, or the Crown.",3
Weak and dumb,More leftist woke nonsense from Netflix? Well who would have guessed. This has nothing to do with the history except wthat characters wear some old fashion clothes.,4
Doenst Unserstand the hype,Honestly... I do Not Unserstand the hype about this show... Its damn lame,5
Disappointed,"The second season doesn't even remotely have the magic of the first. The only good thing is Kathony. Jonny and Simone have great chemistry and saved the season from total failure. I don't know what to talk about the supposed love triangle.The attempt to make Edwina be a victim...and by the way, Edwina, Violet and Lady D are not at all reminiscent of the characters in the books. The plot of the Featheringtons took up too much screen time, and the Bridgertons (who the series should really be about) were sidelined. I can't stand seeing the Queen wanting to know who Lady Whistledown is anymore. Disappointing. Frustrating. Annoying.",1
Diversity is not the problem - loaded with misogyny,"I do not have a problem with diversity or that this series does not align perfectly with history... but my problem is that it is a period piece. And while they did not hold to truth on the race of aristocrats - you should expect this when it is a Shondaland production, think Hamilton - the issue is they held true on the language used and the seriously deep misogyny. It is almost every line and well, the very theme of the series of events that take place to show the eligible women off to marry a wealthy man.I cannot watch much more of this... so far I'm at 18.5 minutes... and I'm very disappointed.Rule of thumb for me, with all that is out there to watch or even re-watch and might I add READ as well... there is no shortage of entertainment. At 18 minutes my attention should have been grabbed. Rather I picked up my iPad to bang out a note of warning over my complete disappointment with this series.Unless you are a HUGE fan of period pieces, flat acting, misogynistic themes (a woman better get married or suffer the life of a spinster; ""after she went and ruined herself"" UGH!) and as I've seen from the other reviews if you are able to overcome the racial diversity that was not even remotely true (again think Hamilton) - then be my guest.But for me, there is enough oppression out there for women without having to slog through eight 50-minute episodes reminding us how poorly women were and are still treated.For me this is a solid PASS!",1
I'm quite disappointed,"I am sorry, but this is just not right. Don't get me wrong - I like the story, the twists and the actors' performances, BUT! Although we are living in a demanding society, expecting from everyone to respect the ""norms"" and cover all of the requirements, can you imagine Brad Pitt as Nelson Mandela? Well, I can't. History is history and I don't think we should mock or interpret differently the facts.",1
So bad it makes you wanna delete your Netflix account,"I just can't believe that it dares to have over 7/10 rating since it's stuffed with mediocre actors, cheap costumes and plot full with nothing but cliches. I don't know why a serie that would best suit for 12-year-olds would have this much nudity on them. One of the worst series I have yet to seen. Sad and pathetic.",1

"Pure racism. White hate, black worship.","So Daphne, who the queen chose to be the diamond of the first water based on her beauty and composure, who is white, Is then established as by the queen as the most eligible bachelorette. Then a black lady appears and suddenly everyone wants her and nobody wants the white girl. On the opposite spectrum a mysterious black man appears, And because he is black he is the most eligible bachelor automatically and everyone wants him. It is not until they come to an agreement with each other to appear as an item that this black man adds value to this white woman who was otherwise without value without him. Shame on you Netflix! Pure wokism. White hate white guilt white privilege all of facade all fake news. Meanwhile black worship. Pure wokism at
it's worst.",1
Disappointed,"The serie 1 was enjoyable to watch even with history being messed up. The seris two is so disappointed I can't even watch it. One tries so hard to adapt at the characters and this illusion but no . It's is so poorly written ,directed,performed. When you think the main character is gay and the other one does belong to illusion it doesn't seem to stick in my brain. I guess they should send it to space to show it to aliens cause maybe they don't know history sexual orientation etc. Sometimes when someone tries hard to shove their opinions in you it will be a fiasco. Honesty and truth will always rein in history which by the way left the chat in these series.",1
TRASH,"Absolute garbage in every sense of the word! I am forced to write a review of at least 150 characters but have nothing else to say, so: TRASH TRASH TRASH!",1
Season Two Disaster,"Season 1 was a bit of fun. The plot is more or less true to Julia Quinn's book. The leads are extremely attractive and Eloise and Penelope are wonderful. Overall - Quirky and lacking subtlety, but entertaining.Season 2 is not much fun at all. More like painful. The plot drags on and on and on as we see the same scenes repeated ad nauseam. Lots of almost embracing with lots more heavy breathing. Over and over. Pained expressions and anguished conversations - about the same exact things. Over and over. Amateurish direction, and cringeworthy camera work. Every dance, every clinch or near-clinch gives us yet another 360 degree shot. Over and over. Even the costumes lack imagination...they look like they were designed by a twenty year old fashion school dropout.The plot of season 2 was stretched paper thin over 8 episodes, when all of the story would have been so much better told in 3. Why did they not combine two novels into one season?? Why did they not hire decent writers, directors, and designers??Let's hope improvements are made before tackling the next season...",4
Teenage b***s*** romances,I wonder how long will they make such useless drama. Even new age generation kids know that such romance set wrong examples. The relationship between main characters is out right wrong. They fake it and then fall for each other. Are we living in 21st century???? Acting is aweful and stupid. This got 7.4 and all the hype. Grow up Netflix. People !!! stop watching this s***,1
Historical drama???,"Would be great to not to have in our past what we have but simply rewriting history won't change it.
If they would say that's sf show about alternative history that's okay.
But what they showing in this so called historical drama or period drama is simply pure lie.",1
"Embarrasing, bad script, bad acting","What rubbish! Not worth spending time on this kitsch. Its not funny, not charming, not interesting.",1
Wokerton,"Wait a minute what am I seeing here,African women in regency period aristocracy? That cant be right,in fact its not right as the only black people in England at that time were sailors coming and going or some freed slaves. It would be a decent show if it was more historically accurate.",1
Nonsense,Utter and absolute nonsense. There is no black royalty in the UK during the 18/19/20 century. STOP distorting history. Animals. Terrible show. Awful writing. Shocking allowance from the studio.,1
Worst series ever.,Historically incorrect. Unpleasant. Cringe. Oh and I can't use the vomiting emoji thanks to imdb.,1
"It is like Reign, but set a couple of hundred years later","It's the type of thing that you want to hope is a tongue in cheek parody, or a comedy, but it doesn't wink enough to let you know that it is, so the worry is it's a teen melodrama trying to take itself seriously.Not enough good bits from the book are in the show, nd some of the divergences fail to improve either.Don't mind a diverse cast in an unrealistic setting personally, but once that's done, by still keeping the pomp and circumstance, as well as the classism and sexism aspects all still in place makes it obviously jarring.The opportunity would have been to subvert all of that surely, once one of those fabrics was removed. Tell a new and different story more obviously tongue in cheek and more loosely based on the story.Is more similar to Reign (a dreadful, loosely historical teen drama but one that at least is self-knowing about that fact, and plays up to it), than other things that once they did one twist it could have been.Pride & Prejudice and Zombies, would have been a better inspiration, in how to set up the world building of non-accurate or loosely accurate history.",4
Fake history,Pc casting of African Americans in roles not historically accurate for the time. But everybody wants to re write history. How about making a movie about African tribes and cast some white and Mexican dudes in tribal roles. Ok show but that is lame on the pc casting.,1
Save yourself and your time,Horrible and wish I never wasted my time. Saw the whole season; hoping it would get better. Nope. Will not be returning to this one.,1
Zzzzzzzzzzz,"God this is boring, if there was anything decent on normal TV that wasn't a repeat then I definitely would not be sat watching this cringey tripe. Wife seems to be enjoying though.",1
Horrific,The voice over is annoying and the worst 20 minutes ever seen of a show,1
Borderline Excruciating,"Decided to watch this with my wife to see what all the fuss was about. It's weirdly inconsistent in tone. On the one hand, a Regency drama that suggests comparisons to Austen, but on the other a cheesy modern/historical romance story in the bodice ripping tradition.The story line is ludicrously predictable & unrealistic much of the time. The writing is sloppy & the acting very uneven. It's hard to take any of the characters seriously enough to care about them. Of the two leads, Daphne Dynevor is mesmerizingly pretty & does a good job of investing the often stilted script with some life. Regé-Jean Page is also mesmerizingly pretty, but his acting is painfully wooden - perhaps partly a consequence of the scant attention paid to the development of his, or any of the male characters. I suppose this reversal of the usual situation is one of the things that makes Bridgerton ""interesting"" ... but it's not enough to make it worth watching.",5
"Season 1, (5 stars) Season 2, (0 stars)","The whole cleverness and intensity of the show was lost to me. I felt like the characters didn't keep there personality as last season and there was an off feeling and disconnect for entire 8 episodes. I think most of us didn't understand or feel the love between Antony and kate ethier considering he was going after her little sister for so long. Sense we are completely done with Simon and Daphne now, are we just going to go sibling by sibling with love affairs? I'd also say its confusing how daphne and simons moment where the kissed in the garden was the turing point for the entire show but in season 2 there affair is considerably less of a problem for the society. There was multiple things that just didnt fit or make sense to me. I was so excited for this season because of how good last season was and im very sad to say it was a very big let down.",5
They could cast even from Star Trek so realistic,"This is enourmously insane and unrealistic casting and story line that this is like Star Track but in costumes. Has 0 relation with any historical happening but sadly these series alter how people think about histrory. At least in science fiction you know what it is. This is like trying to say very ""realistically"" that they sky is green.",1
Infantile and plotless,"I give it 4 stars for the costumes and color, the utter banal plot and pointlessness of it all is bewildering.",4
Your experience will vary.,"I read the first Bridgerton novel some years ago and loved it, filing in the fun-but-shallow bodice ripper category. I was kind of surprised to see it was being made into a series - I think there are others more worthy of being made into a production- but I was excited to see it nonetheless. I really wish I could have enjoyed this series as a unique experience, but instead I couldn't help but compare it constantly to the book. IMO it falls short in capturing the essence of the original story, the fun and light hearted banter between Daphne and Simon... the passion the develops with them is much greater and while it's never feasible to get an entire book into a series, the show's producer adds unnecessary and distracting elements with the historically inaccurate casting, using current pop music and I don't understand the motivation to change some of the important plot lines and scenes from the story. So, if you're not a historical fiction purist and/or haven't read the book - you'll probably love it. Also, people please don't insult Jane Austen by suggesting this is anything like her exceptional works. Even the book is nowhere in her league.",4
"Lazy concept, relies on gimmicks","I have no problem with actors being from different ethnicities that do not match the traditional set up. If the show had good writing it would pull you in more. The regency England setting in the show is kind of a joke. So much so that it is a distraction. The lead actress has zero appeal. I thought some of the supporting cast where great actors overall. As some people have mentioned, this rewriting of history is very fashionable at the moment. It would have been cool if they came up with a entirely made up world that the same characters inhabited. It would have added more intrigue. I am confused how this show is getting so much praise. It is really is a stinker.",3
the fantasy couldnt save it from the bad everything,"I went in blind, and very quickly figured out its a fantasy. ok
if the writers and producers went to all this trouble to make something never seen before, then they must commit to their ideas.so, put some black people in royalty positions, ok, you have my attention. but what are you going to DO with this unique situation? these creators chose to do nothing. everything in the writing has been done a million times. no chemistry between anyone on camera. no compelling drama.this series, with its inclusive casting and colorful costumes, missed its chance to do something fun by taking itself too seriously. hard pass.",1
Stupid serie.........,"It's hard for me to imagine that there are actually people who really like this. Season 1 was mediocre and predictable, which you often see in romantic stories, but surely there can be some tension and unpredictability in it?! So not in this show. And I understand that this is based on a book series, which I do not intend to read, given the genre, the stories will be just as boring as this series. Because season 2 is even worse than season 1. It's terribly boring and cringy but most of all very awkward, it's so unbelievably awkward that I just fast-forwarded parts to get through it. This season's theme was again predictable opposites drama only this time at the expense of Edwina, main character Kate's own sister. Which she just cheated without respect into going with her own sisters fiance because she's so selfish. And of course everyone in the series already saw that Kate and Anthony could not stay away from each other, but the worthless writers found it necessary to spread this over 8 episodes. With the standard cliche that selfish Kate gets away with her horrific behavior without any consequence, and her sister immediately forgives her as if nothing happened. Only Lord Jack Featherington came off badly because he's a white man, welcome to Hollywood.",1
Absolutely terrible,"I so wanted to like this. I love all things Jane Austen and thought this would be up my alley. It has all the scenery, accents, and costumes of a period piece, but it has no soul whatsoever. I don't know if the acting is terrible, or the writing, maybe both, but I couldn't make it through one episode. It's like watching high-brow robots. Don't waste your time.",1
"Didn't read the books, thrilled to see people of color, just horribly written and directed.","I agree that it's totally ok to rewrite history with diversity. I also have no preset notion of whether it was true to the books, but the writing and directing make this feel like a C level Hallmark movie. I don't blame the actors but, the director has purposely gone for what is a very ""presentational"" style of acting. Like on a sitcom. Each piece of dialogue is performed almost ""to camera"" as if each actor is doing a monologue. Their movements are really big, like theatrical plays and this removes any emotional resonance OR historical accuracy for me. Having been addicted to British period dramas for years, it's the tightness, the emotional understatement of people in society at that time and the characters desperate to break out of it. That's what's compelling to me. This has none of that which, to me, is the ONLY thing that makes it fall short of its status as a historical drama.I'm super sad this didn't work out. Super, super sad. I think Shonda Rimes is a genius and I absolutely crave seeing talented black actors. Just a shame. Glad it's a hit for Shonda and company, because it flips the finger at all the white male executives who have throttled ideas like this for decades.",4
Blatant rubbish,There were no afro nor Asian in that time in England. It's a fact. Get your things straight.,1

Utter bilge,"Amazed this shallow rubbish seems to be at all popular. Appears to be poor Jane Austen fan fiction and cosplay, by people who have only seen bad film versions, latched on to the most superficial aspects and missed all the interesting bits. The narrative device of a printed scandalsheet to explain what is going on seems the final unsubtle insult to an audience, assumed to be too thick to pick up any subtlety whatsoever.",2
Rubbish,"If it wasn't for the fact that we've got a Refuse Workers strike I'd happily put this in the bin. Don't watch I hear you cry. I wasn't, but the wife was binge-watching while I listen to an audiobook of The Day of the Triffids. This mixed race period drama stuff just doesn't work.",1
TERRIBLE,"Absolutely terrible, negative stars. Watched a few episodes thinking it would get better and I want my time back. I get the fictitious aspect of this, I get that its not supposed to be historically accurate. However, it wasn't entertaining, the whole reason I even gave this a go was to be entertained. The weird sex scenes that came out of nowhere did it for me.. I was like nah!! I love REAL historical dramas, fiction or non fiction, but this is a cheap joke. The costumes and hair were so ill made. It felt rushed and lacked attention to detail that I love about the Regency period. All I could do was stare at the horrible wig applications throughout, especially Daphne's. I'm sorry to Jane Austen for witnessing this from her grave. And what is up with Daphne's lack of facial expressions, she is a beautiful young woman but like move your face. Nope this aint it Netflix. Try harder. This better not be the reason you got rid of The Office!!!?!!!",1
Charming but not lovable,"While ""Bridgerton"" has captivated a vast audience with its vibrant portrayal of Regency-era England, it's not without its faults:Historical Inaccuracies: ""Bridgerton,"" in its quest to provide a modern twist on the Regency period, has taken significant liberties with historical facts. The show's depiction of certain events and societal norms often strays from accuracy, opting for drama over authenticity. For instance, the portrayal of Queen Charlotte's role in governance is exaggerated for narrative effect, despite the fact that she did not rule in King George's stead. Moreover, the series includes anachronistic elements such as modern language and music, which, while entertaining, further detach the show from its historical roots.Overemphasis on Costumes: The series' costume design, though visually stunning, has been a point of contention for its historical inaccuracy. The use of bright colors and lavish embellishments, while appealing to the eye, does not align with the more subdued fashion of the actual Regency era. This choice, while contributing to the show's unique aesthetic, can be seen as a distraction from the narrative and a misrepresentation of the period's true style.Script Deviation from the Books: Adaptations often require changes from their source material; however, ""Bridgerton"" has made alterations that one may argue detract from the original story's charm. The series has introduced new characters and subplots that were not present in Julia Quinn's novels. In addition, there was the decision to rearrange the order of the siblings' stories and the significant changes to character arcs. In my opinion, these script deviations have resulted in a less cohesive and engaging narrative compared to the beloved books.In conclusion, while ""Bridgerton"" offers a feast for the senses with its lush settings and costumes, it does so at the expense of historical precision and narrative depth. The show's departure from the source material's storyline has not resonated well.",2
Oh Dear,"In the times before video, when we read books, there was a genre called bodice rippers. This is the visual equivalent. It bears no resemblance to what conditions might have been in that era, features a variety of situations that would have been improbable to say the least and panders to the current trend of multicultural inclusion in denial of history. Watch it for heaving bosoms and sexual titillation. Otherwise, ignore it.",3
I wanted to like it...,"2 star for the costumes, I loved them, some pretty dresses indeed, Simon is handsome, and I liked Penelope's character.
I have to edit my previous 4 star to 2.
I didn't like Daphne from the beginning, she seemed like a spoiled child , but when she accuses Simon to lie to her about not being able to give children, I had enough.
Simon clearly says he cannot give her children so he cannot marry her. She insisted on the marriage anyway.
The story itself...nothing is happening, I keep waiting for something worthwile but now.
Even Pretty Little Liars were better than this. Gossip Girl had some good conversation, some exciting plots.
This? I'll finish it as I don't like unfinished stuff but I definitely wasted my day.",2
"Crude, vulgar and error strewn mock regency","This is a modern social drama in thin disguise as a regency drama. The dialogue is vulgar and unsubtle. The behaviour is quite careless of propriety, protocol and credibility. It has high production values and its lush opulence and modern narrative pacing has some attraction. So of all the stars it loses if one hoped for Austen like depths, or even Disney charm, it regains a couple as modern entertainment. Social dramas need an intelligent script and engaging characters. I am sorry the production invested so much but not in the writers.",3
What a waste of generally good material - unbalanced execution,"I read the books. I liked the books (I have some gripes, but this isn't a book review). I didn't like the series. Good source material was turned into a flimsy cliché. In my view a cheap American view of Regency England.
The actors were well cast, I have no issue with them. I liked the diversity (the myth about Queen Charlotte's ancestry was a good ploy to introduce them. Although, why were the Asian characters. Odd, given the large British colonial presence in Asia.). But the scenario, ugh! I get it, reading is not the same as viewing. But seriously, there were so many redundant scenes. And some were to short, leaving the viewer wondering about why certain things (had) happened. Where a good story teller would show more than tell, important points were made in a few almost off-hand sentences. For example why Simon and Daphne decided to team up; or the reason behind Simon not wanting children. Not well-executed at all. And what was the plot around Baron Featherington about? It was not in the book and completely unnecessary. And it was hastily and vaguely ended. That time could have been better spent in filling in issues like the ones I pointed out before. All in all, most of the main characters came off far less likeable and far more shallow and fickle than in the book. And that's not down to the acting, but completely down to the scenario and probably the directing.So many anachronisms. Unnecessary and completely going against main plot points. Ladies at boxing matches? They'd immediately lost their reputations and be ruined. An idiotic choice from the scenarist, because it completely goes against the character of Daphne (protected, naive, sheltered).
The costumes... soooo over the top. And not in a good way. It was distracting. The costumes of the Bridgertons came of drab and cheap against those of the Featheringtons. Quite a contrast to the book. Lady Feathington's waistline, tightlacing, maids in uniform and silly little caps and capes (all Victorian). And there were so many more (Victorian) anachronisms. Cigarettes, safety matches, glass milk bottles, dance cards, zipper on boots, earstuds, whistling kettles, mutton chops, gymnast in stilettos, etc. Fascinators instead of bonnets, during everyday life moments, no less. Something that doesn't even happen nowadays.
And the music... is it too much to ask for the musicians and the music to be in accordance (string music, but we see flutists)? The dancing to be in synch with the rhythm of the song? And Strauss, really (much later)?
So much of this could be easily avoided. It's an insult to the viewer and in my view to the original author (hardly any anachronisms there).
Also, these anachronisms are even more strange when it's evident that they try to be to be accurate to the period in other aspects, like some old-fashioned idioms and language. Make up your mind already!Yes, maybe I'm too critical. But having read the books, I know it all could have been so much better and so much more sympathetically done. Yes, the books are escapist fluff. But not that fluffy!",2
Shallow and boring,"I suppose people think that watching something in costume somehow qualifies as high art. This depressing mess of cliche certainly proves that it does not.The writing is utterly banal. Dialogue is drab with the only concession to period language being an absence of contractions: 'I cannot agree.', 'He does not love you'. The acting is wooden and the actors and all seem just a little too pleased with themselves. But they're beautiful, so I suppose that's enough.It's depressing that, once again, Britain is portrayed simply through the guise of crinoline and wigs.",3
It's a Harlequin Novel,"It's a Harlequin Novel. It's a Harlequin Novel. It has a big budget and some trendy/edgy choices that try to hide it, but in it's soul, IT'S A HARLEQUIN NOVEL.K, now you know EXACTLY what to expect, plot, writing, romance, and character-wise.They stuck some modern day glittery gunk on it to make it more appealing to a younger audience, who might be in denial about liking the same historical-romance-novel guilty pleasure as the 40+ crowd, and to make it seem like more than it is.Expect things like garish, modern fabrics in the costumes, explicit and plentiful sex scenes, and harp versions of Ariana Grande songs playing at the balls. And the diversity cast everyone is gushing over is tailor-made to distract the 15-25 crowd who would otherwise quibble about the traditional, patriarchal romances (I'm not buying it. If they were doing true Hamilton casting rules, WTH are the Asians? Where are the Hispanics? Either have an actually diverse cast, like in ""the Personal History of David Copperfield"", or stick with a historically accurate one)You'll either find the modern touches fun, or deeply grating on your soul (if ""A Knight's Tale"" bothered the bejeesus out of you, avoid this. If you thought ""Reign"" level costuming and historical accuracy wonderful, you'll be fine) I somewhat feel a more accurate setting would let one appreciate the full junk-food romance of this better, since it would remove the posturing and trying to be edgy and relevant, and let it be what it is, a Harlequin Novel.As for book series accuracy, I'd say it's about as close to the books as the ""Ella Enchanted"" film is to its source material (which is to say, not really, and set in a different world. Book fans, you have been warned.)I wouldn't watch this with other people. It's the screen version of that-time-of-the-month chocolate: intended to be consumed solo, shamefacedly, and voraciously once others are out of the room.",5
Black nobility?,"Every time I see historically inaccurate portrayal of anything before 20th century, it just totally ruins it for me. The moment I saw black nobility, I turned it off.

A tragedy - A modern beach side soap opera done in old english setting,"Nothing can be more appaling than a storyline depicting the drug incuded california beach side vulgarity, like the sex in the city or so, moulded into a tale of old british societies, in the name of gossip and poor taste.

Unwatchable,Switched it off half way through the first episode.,1
Dull and poorly written ''historical drama'',"I watched only the first episode and it was enough for me. I love history and historic movies or documentaries, but this ''historic drama'' is a joke, a very bad taste one...Even Outlander was more historically accurate and it didn't claim to be an historical drama, but a fantasy movie. If Bridgeton would have been set in our time, reinterpreting history, like William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet (1996) it would have been so much better. But set in XIX century and showing a diversity that never existed at that time (see queen Charlotte) it's not just ridiculous and historical inaccurate but even dangerous...Young people not knowing the real history might think that racism never existed, because, look, in XIX century England, coloured people were in the nobility, royalty even...What slavery, what discrimination, this never existed, because history is recreated...Unfortunately is not just one movie, I think that is a new direction that cinematography takes. They did it with Les Misérables, with Javert (the police officer in XIX century France) as a coloured man. If we want to rise awareness about racism and discrimination, I am afraid that this is not the right way to do it. This will just give the false idea that in XIX century, everything was right and fair, while in reality England and France were trading slaves...It's like wiping off a painful (but necessary to know) part of the coloured people history.",1
don't expect anything true to the books.,"It is good more weak performances and could be better and if you have a 2 season that fix the mistakes.
Personality changes I didn't need because in the books they were very good and even better than presented in the series.Maybe if I had never read the books and saw how Just inspired by the books I wouldn't have expected anything much better and in the essence of the books.",4
Sheer lack of chemistry between the leads in season 2,I am a fan of this series for season 1 but season 2 definitely failed to keep up the same expectation. We did not get the love story that we were promised as there was definitely no chemistry between the two main leads this time. Certainly some of the side characters grabbed our attention but not adding anything more to the main story. Could have been made much better!!,5
Basic Shondaland FanFic,"Pretty much what you'd expect from a Shonda Rhimes appropriation of BBC period pieces, Jane Austin, or Vanity Fair. Don't come looking for developed characters or plot. It's focused on setting up meaningless drama. Bad characters are bad, good characters are good, troubled characters are mostly wallowing for brooding's sake. The writing is a hair above fan fiction.
Not my thing. But, if you find her other shows comfort TV, then you'll probably find a lot of the same elements here with more elaborate costumes. Not everything has to please the critics.",2
So bad it's not even fun...,"Script, dialogues, cast, costumes are so wrong it's beyond ridiculous.",1
Inaccurate translation of history make it inauthentic,"I love diversity, black people are gorgeous.....but this piece did not represent true accurate history and history cannot be rewritten to represent what you wish it to represent without taking away from the history that we all experienced and that brought us to the present........was hard to watch because of this....I wish they had stated truthfully.....fiction when representing this piece to be honest....then I could have watched it knowing that it was honest.",1
Unaccurate and shallow,"This is a review only for season 1.I am trying to stick it through the first season, 'cause I hope the second will be better.The lack of historical accuracy is... appalling.From what I see, it's probably maintained in the books as well, probably neither the author nor the director nor the script writer gave a flying * for historical accuracy.I really don't mind the mixed cast as much, but everything else - the costumes are made of syntetic fabrics that I am pretty sure didn't exist in this era; some of the dialogues are, honestly, unbelievable; some of the characters act in a way that is even more unbelievable (say, Eloise smoking alone outside at night, and wearing her hair down and disorderly at all times); the queen being openly interested in matches and intrigue; the dances are implausible for high-society balls; aristocratic ladies attending boxing with wagers??? I could go on and on...
Also, the male lead definitely doesn't give off the vibe of a wanted bachelor, and the chemistry is seriously lacking.The plot is weak, shallow and predictable. I really hope season 02 is better, which is why I'm giving the show a chance.",2
Boring,"Stilted monologues and typical historical romance book genre. Girl meets bad boy, girl convinces said bad boy into marriage, slight problems then they live happily ever after. If I'd known it was from a book and read the book blurb I would never have watched it.",1
All the wrong emphases,"I finished it, just to satisfy my curiosity as to whether anything would feel satisfying by the end, but nothing did. Only side characters got what they really wanted or needed, and the main ones were just romance tropes that idiotically misunderstood one another (when they weren't screwing one another. Is soft-core just expected in all series now? yawn). Something about the pacing and style felt wrong - like random cards from different decks had been shuffled together to play poker. It felt like Baz Luhrmann was ordered to write and direct a Jane Austen novel that he really hated. I think it would have worked better had the world been entirely fictionalized. It was very jarring that the precarious position of people of color in Society was brought up in once instance, but then never entered into any other detail of the story. The story felt untrue to itself, and so I was disappointed overall.",5
Season 3,"The worst season so far. Unconvincing acting, chemistry is gone in this season. Everything looks so forced. It seams lime. From friends to some fatal attraction in 45 minutes. The boy who plays Colin seems to be reading a text off the wall, his face has a frozen expression in every series. The series is carried by Francesca and her energy. The books are different, they are not so shallow, except for Eloise, everyone else has the same mission from season to season. How to get married.it's completely clear to me that these are romance novels, but that doesn't mean they can't be a little more innovative. I hope that they will save the world and that they will finish with screen adaptations of books for this decade.",1
Extremly boring and repetitive,"I gave it a 4 for production values. There is nothing else good about this show.Acting is whatever, there isn't much material to act anyways.The series has 8 episodes per season and the episodes are all alike, the same dialogues and story stretched over considerable screen time.As the title of the review says it is extemely boring to follow through with any attention throughout the entire seasons.The diversity however unlikely for the period of time, I guess it is a creative choice, it is fiction after all. But there is morality attached to it with consequences for which today's woke culture is blind. I will not take it as a minus, as it is irrelevant to the quality of the show...",4
Netflix needs to hire an historical consultant..instead of a woke advisor...,Oh dear..... here we go again...miscast characters divorced from any historical authenticity...to cater for the Woke movement. They should have cast Chris Rock as king of England ...at least he's funny....,3
Victorian wokeness,This show is part of the Netflix Obama $500 million retainer and it shows. Lots of fictional history and historical rewrites to suite the woke and diversity driven mob. It's an epic fail.,1
Utter Garbage,"What utter garbage, terrible stories, nonsense. People probably believe this was based on reality. This show sums up the low standard of shows these days, Netflix are setting a low after a low, they are no better than Starz, who are the lowest, but this comes close.What utter garbage, terrible stories, nonsense.

Regency gossip-girl!?,"Ok it definitely pushes socio-historic boundaries, which could have been interesting but come on - awful script and awful acting. Felt like a mix of twilight and gossip-girl with the unnecessary and weird gossiping, just cheapened the whole thing. It could have worked as a comedy with all the pomposity instead of trying to pull it off as something dramatic. I had a good laugh!",3
Give me my time back,Give me my time back. don't Watch this series because it is waste time Awful awful awful,1
Poor,"As another reviewer said "" teen drama in period costume""This is so full of historical wholes it may as well be part of the curriculum!The language, the class inaccuracies, the dialogue and social graces all seem to be inaccurate.Anyone that expectes this to be anything like a BBC period frame will be greatly disappointed.If your looking for a little distraction and fun then watch it as it is amusing.",5
Absurd,"Absurd miss-representation all for the sake of a drooling, ignorant, mass media fed wokesphere audience.",1
Ok but awfully PC and full atrocious dialogye,"First sat down to this and was amazed just how OTT the PC brigade had been in this. Some worked like the Duke and the Queen but the others were certainly not cast for their acting skills. The main characters were distinctly unlikeable, however the duke Simon was quite tasty to the eye. As was the rather attractive Anthony. The only characters I actually liked were the aforementioned Anthony, Eloise, who was actually a revelation and I rejoiced every time she was on screen and Simons guardian. What annoyed me most however was the obvious lack of screen chemistry between the 2 central characters.",5
generic AF,"Seriously I'd expect this type of show from Americans not the British, everything about the series is nothing new to me. I have seen countless stories like this show and honestly am bored, no mystery, intrigue nothing at all to keep me interested... only character worth watching is the girl who prefers to live her life rather than obsess about marriage, I don't think they handled race well in the show, I think we all know what black went through then, why sugarcoat it and make it seem like white people and black people then saw themselves as equal in England, am black but I'd prefer they made it how it really was in that era, it was weird seeing how black people was represented in the show.
another thing I like about the show is the cinematography, whoever did all those background scenes and finding such beautiful locations deserve a Grammy, I was more interested on how beautiful the town is than the story itself",5
So disappointed it didn't follow the book series.,"The books were sooooo much better! I don't understand the need to change from the stories written in the book series. While I would not have minded stories added, it was just such a disappointment to not see the series played out as written. My ratings was a 4 as I didn't shut it off, but I found myself finding distractions as it just wasn't nearly as magical.",4
Worse Show I have Watched,"I sat back looking forward to a new series on TV.
The first seen was great and from there it went down hill.
A totally mixed up show that I'm was so relieved to find wasn't made by any Brit.
As a review from earlier...Crap.",1
Not much there,"This show is basically one of those romance drivel novels in 8 episodes form. If you are the type who like those dollar romance novels or movies like 50 Shades, then this is the show for you!
I'm sure the show would be popular among girls who seeks romance and empowerment that's not rooted in reality. I.E. 100 lb girl who never threw a punch before knocking out a man with one blow.
Besides the ""forbidden romance"" archetype that's been over done, the show really doesn't have anything of value to offer. No, the sexual and racial politics aren't anything radically insightful. They are just there to fit the palate of the current SJW trends and extremely predictable. Beyond the SJW politics, the acting was blasé and the chemistry was tepid. I've seen B rated softcores more exciting than what this show has to offer. A positive is that the costumes, sets, and production values are pretty high.",4
Boy meets girl,Same old boy meets girl and they marry not enough secrets intrigue wondering what was gonna happen next just not a edge seater anyone can figure this boy meets girl out movie never a real struggle for them to be together to easy.Most British movies have u trying figure what happens intriquing shocking gull of family secrets not told thru story but discovered little by little and truly are secrets just didnt meet my expectations sorry Thanks,2
Jane Austen Lite,"Or, Jane Austen for the masses.I love Shonda. I do not begrudge that woman one iota of her success. She has earned it, and rightfully so. But her work seems to focus on lowest-common-denominator projects, to appeal to the masses. Bridgerton, is no different.Deeply one-dimensional, stereotypical characters: the chubby girl, the mean girls, the rake, the sycophantic and useless father, the overbearing mother, and the dewy-eyed ingenue, the black pregnant teen. Profoundly unlikeable characters. Ostentatious and far too smug for it's own good. ""Look at us,"" they chirped from the sidelines. ""We can modernize a bonnet drama!""Even the absolute worst adaptations of any Austen or Bronte novel is far, far superior than this humourless, charmless, soulless drivel. I've seen telenovelas that were far more entertaining. When the first episode ended with the synchronized dancing and fireworks, I was done. While I was happy to see the ethnically diverse cast, it felt forced and awkward. I nearly went into a diabetic coma just watching the first episode. Insulting and pretentious. Ugh.",2
Boring,I don't get the hype around this.i felt uncomfortable and bored watching this. The whole thing was bizarre and the whole romance around simon was meh.,2
I loved the young men's hair,"I loved the accessories worn by women who needed a different dress for each event, the pushed up squeezed into dresses - I loved the fabrics, I loved the three son's hair, I loved how tortured souls is touched upon by ignorant people who feel they are worldly when they've never gone farther than 20 miles from their fishbowls.What as writer's choice is to create characters with one dimension - annoying was the constant dehumanizing of each other, the control in the story that flows as obsession for the naive, arrogant characters. The main character Daphne, while young, is character who controls through the guise of love. I was astounded when she rapes her husband thinking this is quite fine because 'she in her mind' thinks she is justified. Well well, why was this glossed over by the writers?I love Nicola Coughlan, 'two stones over weight' as one sister declares and as a result will not find a husband, my goodness she was lovely in the story. Great actress. I think the actors did a great job in the roles, characters they are given. You can only stretch as a craft in a one dimensional role.Watch for the fashion, watch for the great acting, and societal lessons of nativity perhaps (from the writer's perspective), but don't watch to see an in-depth, moving series of quality writing.",5
Good actors gone bad,"Why is it that when faced with a bad production so many will attack with the accusation of 'bad acting'? The acting in Bridgerton is more than adequate and far from the worst this production has to offer. The cinematography, lighting and general set design also all hold up reasonably well. But the direction is clearly suspect and the script........ If only this script had been directed as a blazingly farcical parody Bridgerton might have something to offer beyond an embarrassment of the period genre. I look forward to the MST3K treatment, only then will Bridgerton have found its proper venue.",3
Mediocre and boring,"Predictable and boring love story, did not enjoy watching it, at one point I got so bored that staying on the phone resulted more interesting. I must recognise that the acting and the costumes where excellent, but the story itself wasn't that great. Overall it was kind of acceptable.",5
Season 2 is so terrible,This whole season is ridiculous.The acting it terrible from too many of the cast. Overexaggerated and generally uncomfortable the whole time.Avoid avoid avoid.,2
Ridiculous,"I started watching and started laughing.
I started laughing ans stopped watching",2
Awful Series,I absolutely do not understand at all what the crew were thinking or trying to do when they were creating this awful series. This series should never have been created. This series was really confusing and disappointing and did not make any sense at all. The storyline throughout this entire series was very poor and weak and had absolutely no direction at all. The cast selection throughout this entire series was absolutely poor and weak and could have been a lot better and stronger. They did not at all commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. There was not any sign at all of real chemistry throughout this entire series between the cast members.,1
Beautiful but,Gorgeous production but weak acting and dull scripting. Also prurient and salacious unnecessarily.,4
Just another cliche,"If you like cliché shows with no depth, this is the perfect show.",1
"Trash, don't bother","The male lead is given an elaborate back story (poor little rich boy narrative, mother dies at childbirth, cold distant father, lonely upbringing, etc). The actor playing the lead is witless and bland, an untalented, cheesy 'Fabio' wanna-be. Yet the leading lady, who has a very thin backstory shines through in every scene. She is the real star here. I cannot fathom why the creators decided to promote the series using the cheesy leading man as the supposed star. The leading lady must be so miserable! She does manage to put on a brave face in the interviews, a testament to her great acting.",1
No substance,"Very Netflix, very slick and flashy, very inconsequential.",5
Should come with a warning; 'Historically inaccurate'.,"Producers of 'Historical' fiction should have a morale responsibility to portray historical periods as accurately as possible otherwise our children and young people, who may never have studied the dramatised time period, will be taught wild inaccuracies about our past.They will believe this American 'Woke' version of Regency England is as portrayed. So wrong on all levels.What could have been another racier 'Downton Abbey' is now so cringeworthy it's embarrassing. And that's not mentioning the dreadful writing and acting.",1
A prettily coloured drivel,"Love it how this thing bursts onto the scene all guns a-blazing, capturing the audience in the whirl of the latest event of the season not one of the actors seems to give a crap about, before dragging it off, kicking and screaming, into the shallow yet deeply terrifying abyss that is beyond the scene scoop the poop.Strictly for actual children and politically correct fanatics, aka snowflakes.",1
What period is this mess supposed to represent?,"I get it. The director and writer had an idea. GREAT! But let's present this as a fantasy, not some reimagining of a period piece. Stardust, for example, was a terrific fantasy set as a of period piece. This however is just ignorant and indulgent of the some fantasy that exists only in the the writers ignorant addled head. Make the setting Outer Sloblovia and the time out of time. and stop with the cultural appropriation of the 19th century English aristocracy.",3
Awful. Terrible. Boring.,"I have nothing against anachronisms or historical inaccuracy, and am not bothered by the prospect of nudity; and was even quite excited about the ""diverse"" casting. None of those things are particularly problematic in this series (at least for me).The biggest problem is the writing: it is as if it has been written by a teenager, and one with no sense of style or humour. Clunky, cringey and just plain dull.The acting is also pretty iffy...",1
"Melodrama heavy, confused costume design and odd casting choices","Bridgerton is a solid 4 out of 10.The acting is often way over the top and constantly had me in fits of laughter when I was supposed to feel sympathy or anger, the costume and set design is wildly inaccurate as is the casting. On the casting, I'm not saying that a person needs to be a dead ringer for the historical figure they're portraying but they should at least in some way reassemble that person, none of the actors look in anyway like the real people, Queen Anne is the worst offender. Basically this is pride and prejudice with far less effort made to look the period it's set in, more incredibly over the top acting and a far less interesting plot (something I never thought I would be able to say)",4
Ridiculous,Visually stunning. Over acting and ridiculously racially inclusive.Try and make a show original. This seems like another regurgitated period piece with an award teeny racial spin.It seems as though creativity is dead.,3
Take it for what it is...,"If you can get past the fact that Bridgerton is not a historically accurate authentic period drama, but indeed a work of fiction depicting regency London you may find it pleasing...The plot is a bit underwhelming and wholly predictable, but I did enjoy the whole Lady Whistledown element, which did add something original. The Arianda Grande, Taylor Swift quartet was not appreciated to to begin with, but then I actually warmed to it and in the end thought it was rather clever. My favourite character is Eloise; witty, sarcastic, opinionated, bright and curious. There is plenty of scope for her character to grow and be developed. I also enjoyed the backdrop of Georgian Bath!The 'diversity' felt all wrong- is it to be considered diverse with only a black and white cast? If you are going to go down that road of diverse casting, which clearly was the aim, then it needs to be done with some actual, erm...diversity.",5
A struggle to get through,"I watched the first episode last winter (cuz of all the hype) and was like, 'Mm. No thanks."" Then my cousin said I needed to watch the rest. So I did, yesterday. It was not fun. The main characters are irritating and the sex scenes NOT hot (as popularly claimed). Writing and plot weird, confounding, and not satisfying. A few of the more sideline characters--boxing guy and his wife, and Eloise--were much more compelling. There was a gay side plot that was interesting and pretty well done but barely touched upon. Besides that, I strongly disliked the whole viewing experience.",1
season two was rubbish,"What's the chemistry in season 2?? Joking in a mud wow. Literally idk why they removed the romance between the duke and daphne like in episode 1 and 2 of season 1, I hated season 2 i hate it really too boring. Season 1 was a lot better than 2.Watching every second is like a punishment i swear. Another thing imagine if your sister told you not to worry about someone and forget them later you found out they love each other lmao. Don't worry there are other suitors this one is mine.Letting down your own sister who trusted you is mistaken for romance??? Okay.Season two rubbish rubbish rubbish rubbish rubbish.",2
Pretentious,"I'll admit: I didn't make it through the 1st episode of the 1st season. The narration reminded me of Gossip Girl, though the series caters to the same, teen-age audience. I would probably be fascinated watching this as a 6th-grader.Besides being an eye-candy (I enjoyed the scenery, costumes, and architecture) the content is pretentious/very a-lá, the dialogues seem staged, and the overall plot (as of the 1st episode) is frankly boring and very obvious.",5
Just weird...,"I started watching this after all the popularity it was given on the internet. First episode: I seriously wanted to abandon after 10 minutes but then I decided to give it a chance.
The characters are overacting, the fake english accent of some actors is unbearable. The ""gossip girl"" of the 1800s is just weird, I would have preferred if there was no narrator.
The show simply portrais shallow, empty and superficial values...I think it would have been more interesting if Eloise was the main character and so the show would have portaited an ambitious girl in the 1800s who just wanted more in life than ""a husband to marry, a family and children"". Just ugh!!",5
Historically incorrect representation,You can't do a book based movie for a specific time in the history and interpret the history so wrongly.. How can you make the queen of England black?! Just disappointed with all the confusions in this movie and it could of become a really good movie..,5
Ridiculous,This serie is an absolute ridiculous . It is a poorly produced and futile comedy.,3
Love hate relationship,"I started off the show thinking 'whaaaat?' and then realized it was half in spoof or fantasy. Got over my dislike of episode one with that scene in the first 15 mins - and tried it again. I do love the clothes, hair styles, balls, stately homes. Some interesting characters and plot developments -but it started to be downright silly after awhile. Totally unbelievable and nothing like real period dramas I normally love. Too much thrown in there of the ""love"" scenes, after several of those scenes and each more detailed than the last, more and more nudity and the lovers getting it on everywhere, and anywhere, was seriously was thinking how embarrassing for the lead actors, but they signed up and obviously were ok to do it, and many viewers seem to like this show. I gave up finally, not sure I will go back to it. The whole story is starting to seem too stupid and trashy to finish out season 1.",5
"Beautiful scenery, horrible dialogue","It can't decide what it wants to be. There is no consistency in the rules of the world that they've created. It's SO LOOSELY nowhere near to being historically accurate that it's actually confusing. I very much enjoyed the diversity in the cast which I think is a great way to be historically inaccurate, but ""loose the bonds of misogyny"" god so old. The only tune it seemed! Too many tropes and cliches. Also, WAY more sex than I expected.",3
Entertaining at best,"Although it is indeed entertaining, as a fan of historical portrayals of fiction, it is painful to see the misrepresentation in terms of clothing, customs and overall society. I agree on the inclusion of people of color as a license but the rest is just infuriating.",4
"It's a ""0""","It's no wonder television and feature films are losing audiences. They're producing junk like this show. I watched one episode, which was very difficult, and couldn't bare to watch another episode. I'd like that hour of my life returned but it won't happen so I'll use this experience as a life lesson in poor decision making by me.",1
Nothin makes sense,"The ingredients of this series do not merge at all and the end product is neither tasty nor nutritious.Don't expect to watch something relatable. It is more of a fantasy series and in my opinion a really weak one. If there is something deserving that one star, it is only the handsomeness of the actors and actresses, not even their performance. I am not exaggerating saying that I wouldn't be surprised if one of them would bring their smart phone or tablet out to search for sex-related questions or digging into the roots of certain behavioural issues.I do expect pop movies and series to be on the dreamy side, but they must make sense. This story could have happened in a contemporary time. Dresses and the decor depict the old times but the story tries to touch every modern issue, from racism and sexism, to mental health issues and their roots, to the controversial issue of sex education, and so on. Meanwhile, in such an advanced and modern society, it is okay for 16 year old girls to need Queen's approval to be presented to the society and get married at that age.Pure waste of time, power, and your internet bandwidth!",1
Sadly it's not historically near correct,"I'm sure if this had been made in England by English then it would have historically been correct for this period in time.
I enjoyed the story and most of the acting but having watched wonderful series such as Downton abbey and the crown I felt a little let down.",3
Boring and cringe,Really boring after 30 minites. But sorry it is very disappointing and cringing.,2
Disappointed and Insulted,"Netflix could have at least kept this soap opera true to the historical period in which it takes place. I fully expected to see BLM posters hanging at the palace. I realize minority actors need to work and I fully support that effort, but as I don't want to see Porgy and Bess with white actors, neither do I want to see minorities cast as royalty in 1813 England. To top it off, the Gossip Girl narration was just too much.",1
Another plate full of cr p from the Leftist cult,"(Oh, look, the Leftist cult sh tsmears mass flagged my review to have it removed because they are so weak that they cannot tolerate an opinion that is against their own. How sad for them. So I'm happy to repost it.)Rewriting history will NEVER change the reality of history, no matter how hard you try.You want people to take your insanity seriously? Then try casting a white women to play the role of Martin Luther King and show the world that yours isn't a doctrine of rage, but rather a code of equality.But we all know that you won't because your sh t train only goes one way.Your Leftist cult insanity will forever be ridiculed because flying in the face of reality cannot and will not change reality and only demonstrates that you are, deep down inside, simply mentally ill and this is not an actual effort to change society for the better, but in all actuality the ravings of lunatics.",1
If I wanted smut I'd watch every other piece of crud on TV,"I had such high hopes. I love period films. The costumes and production pieces are stunning. The modern input of material choices is seamless and beautiful. But the strong sex scenes have ruined it for me. The acting for me is overworked. I watch period film for their authenticity, for their reminder of simpler times & where morals actually meant something.",2
Ehh.. Not even close to historical,"Im these times with metoo/BLM, Netflix yet again jumps on the wagon. Promoting ethnic minorities, and giving those that watch the series, a false idea of hoe things were om the 18th century.It literally makes me puke, that they are brownwashing history.",3
Shallow,Bridgerton has nothing on Downton Abbey or The Tudors. I even like Reign better than this. Historical accuracy ALWAYS matters hence why Hamilton is garbage and Bridgerton is a joke.,3
Jane Austen it ain't,"Watching Bridgerton is a pleasant enough way to spend a few hours but it falls way short of the quality of Pride and Predjudice, Sense and Sensibility, Northanger Abbey etc. The casting is innovative and interesting but the quality of the acting is very patchy. The less convincing performances are probably down to the actors not being suitable for this genre.",5
Too much for a role model,How is this for a role model?! When will we move women to the 21st century and stop presenting them as hapless creatures waiting to be governed by men?,1
Rather dull,I found it to be rather dull than it originally in the books emotions were far from the reality seems a bit forced season 1 seemed quite alright but season 2 doesn't offer tht much quality in comparison.,1
Why not throw in some dragons and make it an actual fantasy,"Apparently, we should look passed the historical inaccuracies (of which there are a lot) because it is 'a fantasy'. But if it is, why put up a totally fake Regency setting with an English queen and everything? Why not create a real fantasy world (worked for George RR Martin) and go wild, with boxing woman and men being the ones scared for their reputation for a change?",3
Very disappointed,I was excited to watch it. Unfortunately I'm totally disappointed. The relationship between The duke and Daphne is beyond annoying. The rest is just a lot of bs.,3
People miss romance,"I think the only reason this show became so popular is that people miss romance. I watched the first 2 episodes and I liked the story at the beginning, but the idea of not wanting to have a family and be happy because of a stupid vow is just so stupid and it kinda ruined the show for me.",3
Don't get what all the hype is about,"So many people told me to watch it, said it's really good. Just watched season 1 and 2, honestly don't know why it's been so raved about. Pretty uninteresting, season 1 definitely better than season 2 however.",5
So boring!,Super slow and boring. Only good thing about it was the Duke,4
BRIDGERTON TV SERIES 1& 2. REVIEW,"I found it interesting to read the various reviews of the two season series of this TV production.Like one should expect the reviews varied greatly in critical appraisal, proving just how diverse mankind truly is. Critiques should not be judged as absolute truth but as invitations for conversations.An English Comedian Arthur Roberts (1852-1933) coined the word SPOOF.For me this TV Series was a pastiche of 19th century style. The production produces a humorously exaggerated imitation, a parody of a style & life long past.The lavish, elegant mansions, country houses & the privileged lifestyle of the Regency Era is well documented & embellished here in Bridgerton. I for one enjoyed the amusing presentation of the opulent, often pretentious lifestyles of the affluent who lived in this era.Bridgerton is bursting with Regency inspired attire. One of the greatest joys of period dramas are the costumes for which Bridgerton does not disappoint, they are historically accurate. The Queens Wigs are sensational, given their size & weight, one may assume that they induced head & neck pain. There are examples of archaic society rules throughout the series. The social season & marriage market where real. However, personally I do not believe that this series was produced to be a serious historical drama, nor a insightful look into the lives of actual families. Did Shondaland ever pose this series as a real representation of the period even though there are some parts that are actually accurate, I think not.To sum up my view of Bridgerton: This Regency Era production pivots on the saucy shenanigans , sexual scenes, & superficial explorations of the 1813 London time period. Overall, I found the series lighthearted, visually pleasing, & entertaining. The entire cast & crew gave applause worthy performances in what I assume was a challenging production. However, the story episodes I fond to be quite repetitive and somewhat shallow. If you decide to watch this series, I would suggest you take it lightly & enjoy the splendour of the many outstanding, beautiful & distinctive, elements in this Bridgerton Series.",5
Lock your brain before watching,"Initially when I watched it, the main onscreen couple's chemistry will carry it through. But, a large part of it is intolerable. It is a dumbed down, rom-com, unrealistic representation of society. But then, if you want to show a utopian lie instead of being true to the period, why not extend that beyond race to also show independent women or less class difference?And what's with the toxic relationship at the heart of this story, full of lies and deception?If you watch period shows, don't expect this to join the ranks of those. It is a soap opera that cheapens the genre, sells sex and doesn't show any depth in characters. Watch it in place of a rom-com and you may enjoy it.",4
Skip this and go for Sanditon,"While the show was an enjoyable enough watch, it missed the mark on so many levels. Bridgerton attempted to cast a rosy shadow on history by cutting out racism for essentially the sake of being diverse and trendy. If you wanna tackle race in an English period piece do it well or don't do it all. BBC's Sanditon explores race and diversity so much better. The shows are pretty similar but Sanditon is far more nuanced than this soapy fanfiction of British history. If you expected more from this show, watch Sanditon.",3
Entertaining self righteousness,"Beautiful costumes, sets and actors but story is lacking and quite boring at times. The chemistry between the two leading actors is good and their light conversations are fun and entertaining. Only downsides are the preachy social sermons, unrealistic boxing sessions and the constant adult lecturing to a kindergarten boy...",4
Why was this so popular?,I don't understand the popularity of this show! I have tried to watch it three times and cannot get past the second episode. The acting is horrible and the storyline is so simplistic. I don't care about any of these characters. I really wanted to like it but I am done!,2
It's as good as its steamy scenes,"The show is honestly just boring. I don't even care if it's close to reality, but boring is a big deal. I enjoyed the end of 5th episode through the end of 6th, and if you watched it - you know why. So if you are like me and enjoy well shot intimate scenes - watch those two episodes and be done with it.",5
A 6 for the costumes and scenery.,Loved the costumes and the places. Apart from that it seemed like a mediocre version of Jane Austen's books (which I love). It tried to grasp the sentiments of that period of time but it felt kinda forced had no spirit. It's pleasant if you have nothing else to watch but I really don't understand what all the fuss is about.,4
Haha. Well...,"This is not good, in fact it's kind of a hot mess. It's visually stunning and that's about it. Mildly entertaining if you want to shut your brain off for a while, but be warned you may forfeit a few IQ points.",5
Not Downtown Abbey,"This was made for teens, do not watch it thinking you are getting Downtown Abbey you aren't. Definitely over rated.",5
I love it and hate it,"Back in 2020 when Bridgerton came on the scene and was all the hype, I started watching. I couldn't initially get past the first episode when all the characters were introduced. I thought to myself ""are they kidding?"". I instantly took a dislike to Lady Danbury and the queen. Their strong personalities completely turned me off (as I'm sure that wasn't the writers intent, but a theme I noticed throughout: unlikeable males and strong, brave females). So I stopped watching. I don't know why but I started watching again, almost 2 years later. Here are my thoughts.Season 1: I loved the character of Daphne. She's a likable character and the actress playing her. The character of Simon on the other hand, another unlikable character. I didn't understand Daphne's attraction for him. The rest of the storyline bored me to pieces so it was hard to follow because I think I daydreamed through most of it.Season 2: I loved the character of Kate. Anthony on the other hand, very unlikable character. See a theme? It boggles the mind, if the author wants the main characters to fall in love, why make the men so course and off putting? It made me wonder what Kate even saw in him. Because he had an intense look he gave her from time to time? Absolutely no redeeming qualities of Anthony or Simon. The strong and brave women are supposed to fall for these men? I don't think so.Eloise and Penelope: I loved these characters. Eloise is supposed to be a free thinking feminist and while normally that would be annoying, she pulled it off and was likable. Maybe it was the actress that played her. Penelope, while she annoyed me at first, her character grew on me. The actress is adorable.I think the show was a hit and miss. I think character development was lacking. When you're rooting for the two main leads to not get together because you can't stand the man, I think that's a big miss. Some of the story lines were entertaining and some were boring such as Lady Featherington daughters storylines. That being said, I will be watching Season 3.",5
A send up of period drama,"If you take this as a spoof/sendup of a period drama, it might be OK. Otherwise, it's a Hot Mess. Don't expect much of it to actually relate to some kind of real, recorded history. For instance, the costumes are ludicrously bright, the sets all seem to be painted and wallpapered this morning, the wigs are absolutely laughable, and suddenly there has been a color change in the general population of Britain.There is pretty heavy emphasis on sex and nudity because the overall plot and writing is so boring and lacking. God forbid we should experience any ""depth"" to a story ! Even as an erotic film, it doesn't make the grade. If this is somebody's grand idea to infuse diversity into history, then it is even more laughable. People of color deserve a much better platform than this one.",4
a bit silly,I think this was made by extreme idiots who are pretending to be not extreme idiots...theres something deeply dishonest about it?? If Elizabeth Holmes the well known con woman of Theranos made movies...this would be it!,3
"Extremely niche, but not without its upside","I will start with the obvious - I did not read any of the books. I have, however, went through more than a couple of reviews after finishing the first (and thankfully only) season. The overwhelming majority come from people who are big fans of the books - as one would expect. This review, however, would be aimed at those of you who would unbiasedly expect quality cinema.The world of television is not without its fair share of great period dramas. The BBC alone has made sure of that over the years.""Bridgerton"" is not one of them.The cast is the show's lone bright spot - regardless of how you feel about racially accurate dramas (this is hardly an issue worth discussing in 2021 - the best man/woman for the job gets it, regardless of skin tone), the actors each manage to make the characters their own by the end of the season. It shouldn't have been too hard, seeing as most of them are very one-dimensional and favour a specific trait or personality.The writing, the costumes and the visual feel of it all is a circus of borderline cringe, I'm almost sorry to say. If you were to treat ""Bridgerton"" as what it is, you would not be displeased. But those of you seeking a period drama with solid plot points, accurate depictions and strong characters would do well to keep looking.However, if you're in search of something light to leave on while going about the house or have always wondered what a watered down Gossip Girl would look like ages ago, this is definitely worth a shot.",4
Historical fanfiction at best,"If you want historical accuracy, authenticity, and sophistication, look elsewhere. If you want high-budget, cliché escapism, you're in the right place!I threw realism out the window and just watched the whole series. It's cute, absurd, and shallow. Watch it for the silly drama if you want, but don't come crying to me if you start drowning in the gnarly reimagining of history.",4
implausible,"Absolutno not corresponding to history. It is a pity, because young people who watch such the TV show do not get a real display of history.",2
Consent? Never heard of it.,That was so toxic and problematic that I'm still baffled after ending season 1. That was rape and we all know it. Let's not sugar coat what Daphne did.,5
Wokness,Historical dramas should be historically accurate.,2
Ho-hum,"Never read the books, so I can't critique the differences, but I'm a sucker for period pieces brought to the screen. This is one I won't be rewatching; the storyline was confusing, the sex scenes gratuitious and overlong, and the premise for the Duke's aversion to fatherhood not credible.",5
SEASON 2 is a TOTAL LET DOWN! (SPOILER ALERT!!!),"Season 1 was so good and after waiting and waiting, season 2 was a total let down. There is NO explaination of where the Duke is, no one even asks Daphne how he is or where he is, there literally is no mention of him the ENTIRE season, other than her saying she left him at home.The show got so far off the storyline of the book that you cannot even say it is loosely based off the book, other than the characters. The book says Kate wins the game of pall mall by knocking Anthony's ball into a lake. I waited for that scene and it never happened. I waited for the scene where Kate is wandering around Aubrey hall looking for a book in the library and it rains and you find out she has panic attacks when there are thunderstorms, it never happens....It talks about Benedict being accepted to art school.... that will be interesting because in his own story according to the book, no one seems to know that he can draw until he meets Sophie Beckett and she sees his drawings... so... that was a weird thing to bring up now.This season was a snooze fest compared to season 1. There was no suspense from one episode to the next like last season, where you couldn't wait to see what happened next..... I feel so let down.The story line with Eloise and the Queen thinking she is Lady Whistledown wasn't in the book and if this series keeps going, that will be interesting trying to tie that into Collin and Penelope's story in season 4. (A season where hopefully they will do better than the book did since there is so much build up in book 1, 2 and and 3 leading up to their story, although it is suppose to take place when they are 28, so THAT will be interesting as well since it the book says Penelope loses a lot of ""baby"" fat and is thinner at 28, gets revealed to everyone as Lady Whistledown when Colin finds out and doesn't even get mad about, but instead brags to everyone about later when they are married... after she has spent 11 years destroying people, especially his family.I wish they would have followed the book more this season... I wish they would have used the scene with the bee, the way the book intended it to be , where Anthony and Kate are seen and they must then wed to avoid scandal, but both act as if they are not pleased about it, even though they secretly both are.For season 1 to have had so many side stories and sex scenes to this very, very tamed down version that was so derailed from the ACTUAL story written by Julia, was just SUCH a disappointment after waiting for so long.The best part of the series is the costumes and the sets. Please, hire a new writer and work with Julia Quinn more to stick closer to her stories, with the exception of Colin and Penelope's story in Season 4, should you get there. THAT story needs a TOTAL rewrite to make it much steamier after the years of build up and waiting for these two to get together! Especially if Penelope holds out and remains a virgin all those years. PLEASE for the love of GOD, make it GOOD!",2
8 episodes that were extremely hard to get through.,"I've never read the books nor heard about them before, so I suspect that whatever first intrigued me to pick up or carry on with this show might have been the things that more or less sticked closer to the original story. This as a production was extremely poorly executed, everyone else here already stated why. Clickbait at its best. Well played, Netflix, well played.",1
It's OK,"There were many changes from the book. I didn't really care for the changes. There were added characters that didn't do anything for the actual plot except stretch everything out. Generally, the costuming was strange for some instances and while the Duke is perfect for the role, why was his costuming some much more avant-garde than the other male characters who wore proper ton style clothing? I understand what others are saying in regards to the diversity, but on that point, this is a fictional world that can look however the writer wants, however, I understand the reservations around that and if this wasn't an actual book first, I could suspend reality, but it's a regency romance first, which lends itself to certain expectations. All in all it's just OK for me. I'll watch this first season, but maybe not another. I'm actually kind of sad because a lot of the lighthearted fun wasn't included in the Netflix version. I just disappointed.",4
"Can't watch, but you want a review??",There's no place on this app to play this video. How can I rate something that I cannot watch?,1
"3 stars the cast's efforts, -7 for the story","I get it, we live in a politically correct world...we have no choice but to accept that if we want to watch shows or movies anymore. I have not read the books this is based on so have no frame of reference other than that Netflix series. Having said that, Bridgeton is very empty. The acting is really well done for what the actors have been given. They each are acting as though they believe their characters...but that is pretty much where it all ends for me. Honestly, the biggest killer for me is the queen. No, it has nothing to do with her race, but everything to do with her character. The only two things her character has been given to care about is that her favorite people are choosing the correct mates and asking for constant updates whether the king has died yet...although I do not know why those are her only two concerns...as the queen of England. Oh wait, a third...parties. As with most other characters, that is the depth of the humanness they have been granted by the writers. This is also known as lazy writing. It is almost as though an American writer took all the stereotypes they had ever heard about early England and wrote it into a storyline; even though nearly every single one has long been documented as fairytale and fabrication. Again, lazy writing and severe lack of research (yes, I know it is fiction but at least get the time period and mentalities correct as the basis).What could have been something of a Downton Abbey part II series ends up being a vapid footnote of a small series of people's lives. It is quite reminiscent of the last couple seasons of Grey's Anatomy where it was clear they had run out of good ideas and all creativity had become frustrated and took the early train out of the writing room. So, again, 3 stars for the cast's attempts to make it interesting but -7 stars for the empty and quite lazy writing. Heck, it is stuff like this that makes me want to try my hand at script writing...may as well make a couple million myself if this kind of stuff allows the writers and cast to get rich!",3
Bad Acting,"Great cinematography, good storyline, the soundtrack was just WOW. This was supposed to be a great series but poor acting from the supporting cast ruined it.",1
Overrated,Couldn't get past the 2nd episode. It is soo cliche and is made for young teens with high expectations on cheesy romance.,3
It could've been good,"It could've been great, the story is very good, the cast is great , Phybees performance is excellent, but the sex scenes ruin everything to me, there is no need for them to be so graphic. Is photography disguised as romance.
Its a shame, it could've been a very good show.",3
Essentially Cinderella erotica.,"If you're looking for an easy watch, romping romance in an Austenian setting, this is it. It unashamedly makes no attempt at historical accuracy offering instead a spoof and caricature of the era. The plot is weak and unbelievable yet unexplainably fun. The leads are unconvincing, but the older generation, Polly Walker, Ruth Gemmel, Ben Miller and of course Julie Andrews do a good job within the confines of the scrip. Adjoa Andoh steals the show along with Claudia Jessie. If you take it for what it is then it's entertaining and enjoyable, once you get passed the first two episodes when the characters are mostly unlikeable and annoying, they do grow on you.",5
Mediocre,"I'm going to start with the positive part, the acting is really good. But the movie reminds me a lot of fifty shades of Gray and gossip girl in a Jane Austen era. The main story is a ""damaged"" wealthy, handsome, young man who meets an innocent and romantic young girl. The girl is trying to ""fix"" him.",4
Season two... so disappointing,"They could have done so much with the second season. Yet it was boring and dragged out for way too long. Edwinas relationship with the viscount was stretched far too long, in the book it barely lasts past one dance. All that drama ruined the lovey dovey/ sexy aspect of the show. So boring!! Obviously there were parts that were engaging but it doesn't even compare to season one. What a let down!",2
Woke rubbish,"Awful show, terrible music, horrible costume designs and not based on any reality.",1
Wanted to love it,"I really wanted to love this show, and for the first half of the season, I did. It was only after watching episode four that I began to completely lose interest in the main characters emotionally abusive relationship with one another. Yes, there are some steamy moments and all is well in the end but the level of disrespect these two have for each other (despite claiming to be so very much in love) is maddening. I won't argue that it is most likely telling of what relationships in those days were really like but it still left me yelling at the TV over their sheer lack of communication. Maybe the books are better...
Regardless, the supporting characters are fabulous! They are the saving grace of the show. Had it not been for their side plots and the mystery to find out ""who is whistledown!?"", I believe I would have stopped watching.",5
Entertaining,This is just an English telenovela with no originality at all... it is a mix of Jane Austen plus Gossip Girl plus Marie Antoinette... and then you have this. Nothing remarkable I terms of originality honestly. Fun to watch and then we will forget.,5
Average show with a terrible hideous soundtrack,"The show itself is average; the plot is foreseeable and nothing new, the actors are okay, even though most of the time I can't really feel for them (except for Benedict and Eloise, even though there characters haven't really been developed to have more than one dimension up to now). But what really angers me is the soundtrack (at least the intradiegetic part of it), and I'm shocked that nearly no one else talks about that. Trying to cover modern pieces in a ""classical"" style (even though to the producers this just means letting a string quartet play them) can work out well if you pick the right pieces (e.g. pieces that have at least a slight chance to fit into the period rhythmically and melodically); in this case it didn't. The only song that at least didn't totally disrupt the immersion was Wildest Dreams (because it actually has a little bit of melody). You can clearly see the producers wanted to lure more young people in and didn't think they could endure the series if they would use fitting music. ""Bob, who do young people like?"" ""Well, my granddaughter listens to Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish!"". The last straw for me to write this review was the disturbing dismemberment of the third movement of the ""Four Seasons"". I don't want to go into detail, let's just say it was sacrilegious. Let's hope TwoSetViolin never finds this series, or else they would suffer of bleeding ears (and eyes, watching the musicians play stuff that never actually happens in the music).",4
Non sense,"This show has so much potential but fails in every arena. It could be a love story, but it's a story about sex. It could be funny, and there are opportunities for humor, but it never happens. It could be an adventure, but there's none of that either. It's about a girl falling in love with a ""bad boy"" and getting her first orgasm. Wow, thanks a lot Netflix and so glad that every young girl in the world is watching this and thinks this is what love is.",4
Interesting but not historically accurate,"If you want to make a film about the era you need to show the hardships that people faced.The story is interesting but very factually flawed, it paints a more happy go lucky anyone is welcomed in high society that was not the case back in the day. There was a lot of woe if your skin colour was not ""right"" and people that came into wealth were not just given titles....total load of crock.",5
Hyped to wuthering heights,"I usually love this kind og costume drama, but this one misses the mark. It has been hyped up by the press, but fails. I read that there war a ""sex coordinator"" on site during filming, but for what ? There is not a single scene in this series (first 3 episodes"" that even hints at sex.",2
No chemistry,"It is an agony to watch since there is no chemistry between the leading male/female for both seasons.. to the point that its too unnatural. The few characters that were more real are Penelope, Eloise, lady Danbury and Mrs Hearrington. The rest are just sadly too fake or has nothing noticeable.",5
"Not for everyone, and that's okay!","Honestly this show wasn't my cuppa. However the music is fresh and entertaining, the sets and costumes are exquisite and the leads are likeable enough.",5
Season 1 was awesome. Season 2 was a waste of time.,Season 1 was great. I kind of liked that it wasn't in modern times. It was a little like trying to reboot Gossip Girl only a hundred years earlier.I LOVED all the sex! Omg 😱 !!Season 2 was pretty boring compared to Season 1. I didn't like that the two main characters were not part of Season 2. Also Season 2 has no sex scenes. I think that's why the show was so popular. Not sure why Netflix decided to make Season 2 super boring and no sex scenes.I am pretty sure the reason for the success of Season 1 was all the sex scenes. Not sure how you have a steamy first season and then change the dynamic of the show and make it more PG. Please bring back the sex in Season 3!,5
Color Blind Casting in Historical Productions Matter of Taste,"The phenomena of color blind casting in historical productions has its origins with socially liberal British producers. In Britain, audiences are more used to mandated diversity casting by some networks in historical dramas which may or may not utilize color blind casting. However, typically American productions do not. I must admit, I prefer to see characters as they would look like in reality, not in a symbolic nature. There are some people who believe exactly what they see & I am not a believer in productions leaving more questions than answers. My opinion is historical productions can have diversity without misrepresenting history. In general though, thoughts about color blind casting are a matter of taste & style. There are no right or wrong answers.",5
Lots of snowflakes in the reviews,"Ok...if you are enjoy classic period pieces you WILL NOT like this. It is no Pride and Prejudice or Emma. If you're older and enjoy Downton Abbey...you WONT like this. The story is pretty cringe and seems rushed and not well thought out. However, I see the appeal for younger people who may not be into period dramas. Hopefully it is a stepping stone into real period pieces.It is pretty mediocre in my opinion, but that is not because the cast is diverse. I really like that there is a diverse cast. Who cares about historical accuracy. Many of these shows aren't even when there are no POC. These comments DO NOT CARE about accuracy...they are just bothered that there are POC in this.I'm pretty convinced that most did not watch the whole thing just because they saw a POC within the first 2 minutes. Since when is adding other human beings that happen to have a different skin color than you ""propaganda"" and ""political correctness""? Ridiculous. Grow up. They are human. I bet these same people are crying about how they don't see skin color--when obviously they do. And they're bothered. Snowflakes. 5/10.",5
Light and uber-fluffy. The lightest of plots...,"Highly hyped, this disappointed quite a lot. It's the Michelin restaurant equivalent of squirty cream. Light and predictable plot, deliciously over acted, a gentle Sunday afternoon viewing at best - I think the U.S audience will lap it up and think they've had a history lesson. Enjoy!",5
Just go read the books.,"Seriously. All this series has in common with the books is the name of some of the characters and one or two plot points. Otherwise, they are totally different animals, the books being far better.To whomever is responsible, a point: a good actor is a good actor, regardless of their skin color. Kenneth Brannaugh did not find it necessary to rewrite Shakespeare to justify casting Denzel Washington. Your making the queen black in order to explain the presence of black people in your cast is insulting to your actors.",2
"Season 1 is great, season 2 abysmal","Originally I was shocked at this take of a typical British historical show with the mixed races. No one was crying out against POC taking purely Caucasian roles. But politics aside...
Loved the tension and characters of season 1. It melded beautifully and was very entertaining, especially the 2 leads.Season 2 was ridiculous!! Completely disappointed after the first season. No chemistry, tension was way too forced. The side stories were bland and boring.Guess we will see what they do with season 3...don't have high hopes. Just watch season one!",5
Season 2 let down,First season had great romantic scenes and steamy sex scenes. Second season like so many cut out the scenes that made it so steamy. This whole season seems to have been designed for mainstream tv and not for Netflix. If you give it a tv-ma rating I expect you to hold true to what made it a hit. The only thing that stayed the same in season 2 is the back stabbing and arrogance of the staff. I was bored so many times during this season and found myself playing games instead of watching. Major letdown.,2
A boring series with a lot of potential wasted,"I finally cave in and watched Bridgerton. Everyone is talking about it so I couldn't not see this.
I found it terrible boring. With a few sparkles of potencial springled over the 8 episodes.
I think the 1 hour long episodes hurts the pacing. Maybe 10 to 13 thirthy minutes episodes could have been so much better.
The production and the vestuary is amazing. The score is really good (except a few choices). The actors are ok. The direction is meh.
And don't get me started on the parties and sex scenes... the are to many of them and always is filmed the same, so after a while it gets really really boring.
In the firt half is conversations and going to parties. In the other half: more conversations, more parties and now add the sex scenes.I truly belive this had so much potencial maybe with shorter episidoes, a better direction and editing?",5
Rene-Jean Page,Four stars for the pleasure of observing Rene-Jean Page. Not much else is worth the watch. I did like Nicola Coughlan (Penelope Featherington) though.,4
So Cringe,"This show is cringey. I love the costumes and diversity, but the story is garbage. Let's pretend we are dating, but we're not dating is so played out. Somehow I watched 2 episodes without a barf bag. Maybe it's for teenagers because it is not for me. I watched Dawson's Creek when I was young so who am I to talk?",4
"Season 1: Historical Fiction Felt Rushed, Lacked Depth","Season 1 felt rushed to me. The producers and writers should have taken their time to draw out the story for two seasons, in my opinion, to fully flesh out the characters and give everyone some much deserving depth.
By the time anything consequential happens to anyone you hardly care because sufficient time wasn't devoted to developing who these people are and why we should care about what happens to them.
The end of this season was dissatisfying as well. Overall I probably won't rewatch it unless I want to watch some soft-core porn.",3
Bridgestone marriage,I thought the acting was good. But the stories in the main story could of been a lot more in depth. All the costumes and details of that earache were great. Can we see more about the other men from the pick of sutters. Not enough about the Queen either!,5
Less than I expected,"Despite all the nice scenery, costumes and fun modern twists that I loved here, the entire relationship between Hastings and Daphne - especially after the wedding - was so annoyingly childish, toxic and painful to watch that it literally made me gag at times. The fact that they both act like spoiled dishonest children with less than zero communication skills is 10/10 cringe. I'm sick of media trying to convey the message to (young) people that this sort of communication between partners is about passion and fate rather than just being toxic.",4
gossip girl wannabe,"I had a few expectations for this show. after all, when you read 'shondaland' in the credits, you immediately think of grey's anatomy et al. but... and this is a big but, apart from the dresses (they are cute, even the outlandish ones featheringtons wear) and a few situations here and there, this is a predictable and widely stereotyped series. not even the diversity helps. the only character that is barely interesting is eloise... daphne is so... bland. pretty, and when convenient, super smart and sassy, and then back to being a silly young girl. which one is it? and the duke. he is incredible to look at but boy oh boy, what an annoying and undecided man. is he bipolar? sheesh. anyway. i watched the whole thing and it was the worst finding out that penelope is the gossip girl. talk about a cold shower. no depth to anyone on this show.",5
Easily the most historically accurate series every made,"Since every time I review Bridgerton I drop a point, soon I will be at one. This is my third review, and I am dee bee refuses to publish. How very very very odd. Very odd. Odd.",3
It's not as bad as some reviews make it out to be,"It's not *that* bad.But it is bland.I wanted to like this series, if only to spite all the horrible reviewers. There were also two other major points why I really wanted to like this: I love costume dramas and I love my occasional romance.The setting is great and costumes, props and scenery are just gorgeous. The actors do a fine job but their performances can't save the script or directing here. I haven't read the books this is based on, but I have to assume that this is yet another case of ""the books were amazing but it just didn't translate to screen"".I wanted to avoid touching this, but I'll just say: You have to be watching this through some prejudiced lenses to really notice or care about the ""diversity"" a lot of people make a bunch of noise about. The actors are chosen well and fit their roles.But while the show is a joy to visually watch, it's not that joyous to consume and digest. It's not great, let's just say it. I can't pinpoint the reasons why it feels so bland, but you should be the judge for yourself. Maybe you'll like it. It certainly looks amazing, so if you can get into the plot, pacing and way of telling it, you'll probably love it!Unfortunately I just couldn't get myself to finish this series. Maybe I'll revisit this at some point, since I do love a show that looks this great.",5
"Enjoyable, but far from outstanding","This did not live up to its trailers and all the hype, but I disagree with most of the negative reviews. I love the diversity of the cast, even if it's not historically accurate; this is a fictional show so there should be no issue in changing elements to modernise it, especially in regards to racial equality.To be really honest, Elouise and Penelope's relationship and hunt for Whistledown's identity was the best part of the plot. Benedict's growth in independence is also noteworthy. I really didn't care for the romance aspects, however, especially when there's unnecessary s*x forced into every episode, which is highly unrealistic and embarrassing to watch.The classical covers of modern artists such as Ariana Grande were cringey and not to my liking, I would've just used basic music pieces from the period. But I can see how they'd have appeal to the show's primary audience of teens.Overall, watchable and moderately entertaining. I'll be interested to watch the next season.",5
Not good not bad,"I think there is something special in this series, i watch this because i just want to know about the culture",5
unbiased review,"To start I have not read the book. Somehow it did not cross my path even though I love period books as this. My favorite author being Georgette Heyer and Jane Austin a close second. I am from a diverse family myself and have no issue with creative license to make a fictional story that does not match historical accuracy if it understood it is fiction and it took such liberties as it did, an example being modern tunes played by an orchestra. But, this series does not live up to its potential.While the settings and costumes are vibrant the characters are lackluster, dull, boring or annoying like Eloise. The characters did not come across as they should by either bad script, bad casting and at times both. Pen's character is the exception and came across as the most believable. She portrayed real and true human emotions and was neither dull or annoying and the actress played her well. Overall this is a series to watch if you in the mood for a period piece and can overlook the liberties it took and dont expect a masterpiece as some give it but it not a total garbage rating as haters gave it., so in the middle rating i give it, no more than that, too much dull writing and bland characters to give this anymore than a 5 or 6 star rating.",5
You enjoy watching it,"If you wanna spend some time watching sth, you'll enjoy it. But its not great.",5
they had us in the first half,"I wanted to love this show, and for the first half i really did! the costuming and casting is amazing. it's a lot of fun. the string covers of modern songs was a nice touch. i liked a lot of the characters and enjoyed getting to see a variety of relationships develop. and i was really rooting for daphne and simon, at first. but (*SPOILER*) the rape in episode 6 left a bad taste in my mouth, especially the fact that it went completely unacknowledged. regardless of simon's lies, daphne was absolutely in the wrong, and yet daphne is made out to be the victim and simon is forced to apologize and give her what she wants anyway. i absolutely despise daphne and i couldn't root for them after that, no matter how badly i want them to be together in the beginning.",5
Beautiful and Inspirational,"I love this show! I love the diversity, the beautiful multiculturalism, the dresses, the backdrops, the locations. I love the music, the direction, and that it is made by Shonda Rhimes, the greatest television producer EVER!Bridgerton is my new favorite Netflix show. I hope they continue to celebrate diversity, inclusion, and convey history in this way too.Amazing show!",1
Your basic Harlequin novel,"I liked the first episode, but it quickly went downhill from there. The plot is as predictable as it gets, and I correctly predicted all the period tropes and plot development. But this is not necessarily a bad thing, as this isnt the show you watch for clever commentary or brilliant writing. This is your bog-standard nice girl tames the badboy story, with a few sex scenes that are filmed to appeal to housewives. All the characters are one-dimensional, essentially perfectly distilled tropes. They did put a lot of effort into the costumes and choice of colors, so it's visually quite nice.In short, this is a trash tv-show. Like a pocket romance novel with a picture of a barechested riding a white horse with a young innocent woman in his arms that you find in a bargain bin for a buck. But just because it's trash doesnt mean you shouldnt watch it if you like this sort of things.",4
A Bland Tale: Mildly enjoyable and not completely terrible,"Can our Shonda do it again? Can she recreate the Drama, the Emotion, the Fun? Reel us in with her lovable yet flawed characters, the colourful writing and then leave us weeping into Ben&Jerrys with heart-wrenching twists as an echo of How to Save a Life fades in. Can she?Sadly not, as it becomes clear inching into the first episode.(If you don't know what I'm referencing above, I suggest you may need to reconsider your priorities and google Meredith Grey)Back on to Borington. In short Bridgerton is nothing more than a Vanilla melodrama with a few fancy costumes on top. Full of cliche and historical inaccuracy, episodes feel dry and plotless, compared to the majesty of counterparts such as Downton. If you are in market of wanting something resembling Gossip Girl come Pride and Prejudice but worse, this is perfect. The orchestral rendition of 'Thank-U Next' and other pop bangers are welcome moments of interest during the chore of lengthy episodes. The mystery of the covert Lady Whistledown offers a degree of momentum to the series and keeps the viewer just about interested enough to make it to the end. In case anyone reads this and notices there is very little detail in my review, I must admit I can't really remember what happened. This alone speaks volumes as to the unremarkableness ness of this show.To conclude, A Bland Tale; Mildly enjoyable and not completely terrible.
Shonda stick to the Grey-Sloan Memorial HospitalExcited to unleash my first review ever. This was fun. In a lockdown, 2020 kind of way.",4
What is all the hype about?,"Started the series because of the attention given to it, but once I have started it I can't seem to find the reason that this show is hyped up.",2
Great casting but dated plot,"Firstly, there were black people in 19th century London!! So I can't understand why people find it so distracting to see POC cast in nobility, it is fiction, not based on true events. Personally I find it way more distracting to watch historical movies set in foreign countries, where the all of the actors have American accents. And we all know certain religious figures were not white but don't have a problem with them being depicted as so.
But unfortunately this was a watered down period drama with a weak plot and shallow characters. Some trash tv in corsets. Which was a shame.",5
"Nice, but gets boring","A nice fictional documentary about the early 1800's. Very well filmed and some characters really come across. I bet most ladies will like this because of the overkill of romance and sweetness.I just can't get past the flaws.How can they have electrical lighting in a fountain in the early 1800's?

Great.,"I think this series is great. I have to admit I wasn't a fan when I first saw it, as it went on I started to like it. The costumes are great and I think it's how it was like in the 1800,s, I think it is like it. I I think it's not boring at all, it kept or is keeping me gripped.. thank you to everyone who were involved in making this fantastic series. I like it. The characters are great in it and they are strong.",3
I gave it another try and I liked it better but it's not the books,"I wrote a review 2 weeks ago which has now disappeared or been removed. My review was a 1. I read all the books and absolutely love and adore the stories and the characters in the books. I was so devastated and disappointed when I watched the show and how they portrayed the much loved Bridgerton family so I stopped watching after episode 2.A friend of mine urged me to watch the rest and so I gave it another try. I must confess I managed to watch the whole series and actually I liked it after episode 4. The story improved and Anthony improved and was actually bearable from episode 4 onwards. I just had to forget about the books because the show is not the Bridgertons I know and love.I still don't think that blind casting works for a period drama but I can overlook it. I gave this a 5 in my second review because I like Simon and Benedict, and Anthony is exactly how I pictured him in the books (but only his looks not his character as he is much nicer in the books).Surprisingly (most to myself) I am looking forward to season 2 now because Anthony and Kate's story is my favourite along with Benedict and Sophie and Francesca and Michael. I do hope Netflix does Anthony's story justice. And should there be a season 3, I hope they get Benedict story's right because it is so romantic in the books.",5
Maybe I don't get it?,"I've seen before a diverse cast thrown into thick, thick costumes saying long, intricate lines with a grand soundtrack in the background and still have it feel sincere and relatable. This is not one of those cases. None of these situations feel remotely human-like and their priorities and conversations are so far removed from what the current youth is thinking it should be satire, but it at this it also fails.I don't get it. If you remove all the conversations about getting married and having kids you end up with pretty much nothing. It's so bad I wish I could stop watching at their empty little faces.Stars are for music, scenery and costumes.",3
maybe im just not good with romances lol,"Ok so i thought it wasnt too bad up until around episode 3 or 4.
the first episode starts out quite well and sets up the core conflict of the story (finding marriage for the girls) in an efficient and entertaining manner. i appreciated the quick, stylish cuts in the beginning that showcased the hectic chaos of meeting the queen.the fake courting between daphne and the duke was pretty entertaining, but honestly it devolves into a bit of a mess and just gets boring after a while. there is. a lot of sex in this series. and i really don't get why its there other than to be scintillating to the viewer. which is great i guess if that's what you're looking for? but it's not really something that i was all that impressed by so for me it works against the show's favor from a narrative and pacing standpoint. the sex just slows everything down and i ended up skipping through a lot of those scenes to get to the plot lolim currently on episode 6, i just had to get this off my chest. will come back to this when i finish the whole series.",5
Essentially Cinderella erotica.,"If you're looking for an easy watch, romping romance in an Austenian setting, this is it. It unashamedly makes no attempt at historical accuracy, offering instead a spoof and caricature of the era. The plot is weak and unbelievable yet unexplainably fun. The leads are unconvincing, but the older generation, Polly Walker, Ruth Gemmel, Ben Miller and of course Julie Andrews do a good job within the confines of the script. If you take it for what it is then it's entertaining and enjoyable, once you get passed the first two episodes when the characters are mostly unlikeable and annoying, they do grow on you.",5
Mixed emotions,"I mean it really is just a rather sad rendition of english literature, the plot wasn't poor but some of the dialogue was really useless and unnecessary. The thing that annoyed me most was the use of modern songs in the ballroom scenes, because honestly if you are going to do a time piece I don't want to hear the Chainsmokers in the background. Good camera work and scenery though.",5
season 1 was horrendous but season 2 was enjoyable,"S1 was gross to put it best, the main character daphne literally sa her fiancé/husband in order to become pregnant 🤢the show treats it as a good thing and the victim deserved to be assaulted (it's even worse in the books)the show has many problems regardless but, that is just an immediate no.S2 has most of the same problems in term of script and stuff plus the historically inaccurate elements but i much preferred it. It was far more entertaining than s1, the pacing was so much better and i didn't fall asleep like in s1 lol! I loved kate and what ever his name was much more than the duke and daphne.I'd give s1 a 1/10 and s2 a 5.",4
Target audience acquired,"This show is for the enjoyment of married women 45yo and up, specifically women married for 20 or more years. I should know, my wife loves it. #MyExperience",5
Could have been better,"I don't think it was really suppose to be to the fact of the period but more of entertaining, mabey like soaps are. The actors were ok and the best one. R J Page was the best one I thought and he will not be returning next season so won't watch any other season, plus how can you create a strong figure in the show and then not try to bring him back. I like period shows like this but disappointed for the next season. Tudors is a great series to watch also.",3
Nevertheless,"Gratuitous sex ,poor dialogue ,perfect décor and style. Delightful colors, clean roads and houses .Neat shiny people even the farmers .It is just a scientific fiction movie not real period drama adopted from books. Too many sex is absolutely an necessary scene in wedding chambers specially it is a sacred place at that time .one time or hints more than enough.",3
